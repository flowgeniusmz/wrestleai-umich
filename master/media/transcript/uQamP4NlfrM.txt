gommi I made my co-maid off here with his offense likes to work off the two-on-one hey no fingers well neatly go into shots but he just got a variety of skills good balance you know that the gyroscope of these guys is just you know finely tuned I always land on their feet and yaws Donnie he just we just looked Tahoe Grayson James green look and yaws Donnie just picked him apart here accident the Iranian chant echoing here in the arena great wrestling fans love their rustling look what's it yes Tommy mean one pint at 45 seconds have elapsed not much action to begin as seems to be standard here particularly in the metal rounds Tommy not the Madoff really likes to work the head nice giving up an underhook there you tell he's pretty uncomfortable with that guys Don even working that underhook hard maybe looking for a step up step out hey controlling the two-on-one changing off sides but right now he had being warned to pick up the action minute 20 thus far in this match Oh a nice penetration there yeah guys are making that up he doesn't have it he's got snotty looking for the lift crotch lift arm trapped trying to get a little more weight on his feet where he commits to it and the length of gamma made mo Madoff it's really helping him near because he's able to go ahead and keep his balance now he's going to work on his slow crack back action right here where he's going to go ahead and improve his position he reaches across look at that length that he has be able to get to two point take down for it went from almost being crotch lifted to a takedown it's not over yet yep good scramble going on guys Donnie the points have not gone on the scoreboard yet Jim yeah I barely earlier there are yep thought the through just wasn't confirmed at that point so as he may come out up a rush out putting the two points on the scoreboard it was hard to come by but it got done still made now bring them back to their feet 45 seconds remaining in the first period he is so unlike that the 74 pound Russian athlete Dhulia where he's just a Batman is just very strong and physical and this this Russian athlete is those guys got great range look how wide he's at the over she's shot look at the reach he has now he's got the hips locked up high and he might go has Donny might go Chloe we're gonna try to go to the inside trip trip that leg thought for a moment there you might see something very spectacular well you're they got me good tub yeah granny turned away he didn't want to tells his back so he gave up the too powerful leg attack thereby Ghazi Megamart off and now goes I had four to nothing nice little drop there pass double pass nine drops in on the lake cracks it down and then that I'm in a period good action by these two guys that this is to control shots they're my guys a megawatt off of Russia gives him a four old lead there's like to say it's comfortable but perhaps not here's the lift I'm gonna see and as you mentioned Russy as Donny turns away doesn't hold on to with that left arm too hard gives up the leg doesn't want to go to his back a little extra air bang cover look it back at the game we got three more minutes to decide who will win the gold medal here in the 70 kilogram weight class yes Donnie has his work cut out he's down for Lyle makes an attempt but countered leg picked beautiful drive and reach Bowl level is crushing loss Donnie in that position see if he works for another tilt excellent as you may come out off on Russia it comes that lead to six to 0-3 look man 1 takedowns get the job done love is Donnie trying to create some position that will be an advantage to him but as a Begum on top we'll have none of it boy so just so technically sound his balance is good and he's always looking for attacks no penis there is a reason that Ghazi megawatt off his rank number one in his weight class he's been showing us some really crisp technique sharp explosive leg attacks and it's garnered him a six-o lead with just under two minutes remaining here in this gold medal match no fee good see if he starts looking for a little bit of his own offense again that exit there as Donny was able to go ahead get the go behind its kind of spun him down there was a kind of a counter shot attempt there because he's gonna go Madoff and that's kind of the activity that we saw before the previous match here were work when the bronze medal matches were for was able to come back strong the turkey seat that day yes Donny has they can keep that type of pace up a lot of work to be done here for Yas Donny if he wants to win this match he's down by four points with one minute to go and he's in trouble again as I may come on up able to score another two point take down exhaling that lead back to six with an 82 margin yeah guys Donny just shooting across the body they're trying to create something with short time left in the last period Gazi Marco Madoff would end up just cut the corner on him here keeping his hips down chest up now he's gonna drop back in in another shot this one looks more like two just to hold on and by a little clock now he's looking to go ahead move up a better opportunity as Donny looking to lock in the cross you need to get a tilt nothing yell no back exposure just a nice counter there that has not scored any points 20 seconds to go getting desperate down switched to a double and he loses out has a big amount off now with the Tenno leads 10 to lead 10 seconds to go but back to their feet we close this one out here gold medal match at 70 kilograms the Russian firmly in control of this one heads up heads up 1.4 Yas Donny has he steps out of bounds and that will be yet rushon corners very pleased with that effort he's got some energy out Magomedov Oh Gaza Magomedov will win the gold medal 70 kilograms a long day
