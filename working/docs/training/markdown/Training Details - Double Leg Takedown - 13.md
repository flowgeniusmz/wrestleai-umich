| 0.08 | 5.20 | 5.28 | all my traditional shots require that |
| 2.56 | 4.72 | 7.28 | he"s pushing into me and so |
| 5.28 | 3.20 | 8.48 | if he"s coming at me like a honey badger |
| 7.28 | 2.24 | 9.52 | that"s different okay so it"s like |
| 8.48 | 2.32 | 10.80 | because he"s going to be all tight and |
| 9.52 | 3.44 | 12.96 | everything and i didn"t get a chance to |
| 10.80 | 3.52 | 14.32 | get under but if we were just doing your |
| 12.96 | 3.68 | 16.64 | typical wrestling we"re trying to feel |
| 14.32 | 4.72 | 19.04 | each other out and stuff if he"s pushing |
| 16.64 | 4.96 | 21.60 | me watching my feet here most people |
| 19.04 | 5.20 | 24.24 | they take a big step to stop him okay |
| 21.60 | 4.80 | 26.40 | and so if if he"s pushing me watch my |
| 24.24 | 4.00 | 28.24 | feet again and so he"s pushing me and i |
| 26.40 | 5.28 | 31.68 | have to stop him that"s where he"s |
| 28.24 | 5.12 | 33.36 | that"s when he |
| 31.68 | 3.44 | 35.12 | you"ll get better at feeling this but |
| 33.36 | 4.24 | 37.60 | when when he"s backing up back up he |
| 35.12 | 4.32 | 39.44 | takes that step that"s when you are |
| 37.60 | 3.52 | 41.12 | anticipating he"s going to push back and |
| 39.44 | 3.60 | 43.04 | that"s where all your classic shots come |
| 41.12 | 3.36 | 44.48 | from and everything so if i want a high |
| 43.04 | 2.32 | 45.36 | quality for example |
| 44.48 | 3.12 | 47.60 | and |
| 45.36 | 4.56 | 49.92 | i"m pushing him back and then he takes |
| 47.60 | 4.88 | 52.48 | this big step okay that"s when i |
| 49.92 | 4.40 | 54.32 | disappear that"s when he falls over me |
| 52.48 | 4.00 | 56.48 | okay and he"s gonna fall over because |
| 54.32 | 4.24 | 58.56 | his weight was already transferred that |
| 56.48 | 5.20 | 61.68 | way so and and it"s gonna you"re gonna |
| 58.56 | 4.72 | 63.28 | have to practice all your shots |
| 61.68 | 2.96 | 64.64 | knowing full well that in order and |
| 63.28 | 2.88 | 66.16 | you"re gonna be circling it"s not gonna |
| 64.64 | 3.76 | 68.40 | be linear like this you"re gonna be all |
| 66.16 | 3.12 | 69.28 | over the place but but if i"m here this |
| 68.40 | 2.56 | 70.96 | way |
| 69.28 | 3.92 | 73.20 | let"s see watch he just doesn"t snap |
| 70.96 | 3.28 | 74.24 | down again when i push when he pushes |
| 73.20 | 2.80 | 76.00 | into me |
| 74.24 | 3.12 | 77.36 | and i take this big step |
| 76.00 | 4.08 | 80.08 | that"s when |
| 77.36 | 4.56 | 81.92 | mom"s off balance right |
| 80.08 | 5.36 | 85.44 | and that"s when he can really take |
| 81.92 | 5.84 | 87.76 | advantage of that of that off balance so |
| 85.44 | 5.60 | 91.04 | if he"s not engaging with you we"ll |
| 87.76 | 5.76 | 93.52 | cover that uh in the next |
| 91.04 | 4.40 | 95.44 | in the next video um that"s a whole |
| 93.52 | 3.76 | 97.28 | different thing because |
| 95.44 | 3.44 | 98.88 | in wrestling don"t worry about it |
| 97.28 | 2.80 | 100.08 | because if he"s not engaging with you |
| 98.88 | 2.56 | 101.44 | he"s going to get him for stalling over |
| 100.08 | 3.76 | 103.84 | and over again it is common though in |
| 101.44 | 3.52 | 104.96 | jiu jitsu and i"ll talk about two |
| 103.84 | 2.56 | 106.40 | different takedowns that i think will |
| 104.96 | 3.52 | 108.48 | really help you with that but as a |
| 106.40 | 3.84 | 110.24 | general rule though even if i want an |
| 108.48 | 4.16 | 112.64 | outside shot right like an outside |
| 110.24 | 4.32 | 114.56 | signal i have to get them to stop me |
| 112.64 | 3.28 | 115.92 | and commit to pushing me because what"s |
| 114.56 | 3.36 | 117.92 | going to happen is i"m going to |
| 115.92 | 4.64 | 120.56 | disappear under you |
| 117.92 | 4.88 | 122.80 | right so if i pull in for example |
| 120.56 | 2.24 | 122.80 | um |
| 124.80 | 3.68 | 128.48 | so if i get him and i pull this right |
| 126.32 | 4.24 | 130.56 | foot right it was because when i was |
| 128.48 | 4.56 | 133.04 | pushing him and he stopped me right i |
| 130.56 | 4.72 | 135.28 | pulled that that foot came forward and i |
| 133.04 | 3.04 | 136.08 | was able to get to it okay |
| 135.28 | 3.04 | 138.32 | um |
| 136.08 | 3.76 | 139.84 | if he"s really he"s good about hiding |
| 138.32 | 3.60 | 141.92 | his back leg because he sees that my |
| 139.84 | 3.52 | 143.36 | right leg is forward so he never wants |
| 141.92 | 3.84 | 145.76 | me to have that leg |
| 143.36 | 4.88 | 148.24 | so it"s not an option for me okay you |
| 145.76 | 3.60 | 149.36 | can"t be so hung up on i want that leg |
| 148.24 | 2.96 | 151.20 | because i want to shoot an outside |
| 149.36 | 4.48 | 153.84 | single dude if it"s not there you can"t |
| 151.20 | 5.20 | 156.40 | do it he never gives it to me so so like |
| 153.84 | 4.16 | 158.00 | if i"m here and i"m trying to pull that |
| 156.40 | 3.28 | 159.68 | right leg forward he makes it really |
| 158.00 | 3.20 | 161.20 | hard for it to get close |
| 159.68 | 3.44 | 163.12 | so i"m going to probably have to push |
| 161.20 | 3.44 | 164.64 | him and stop just going to this one |
| 163.12 | 4.40 | 167.52 | because it"s closer |
| 164.64 | 4.80 | 169.44 | okay but notice it looks like |
| 167.52 | 2.64 | 170.16 | i"m taking a huge penetration step and |
| 169.44 | 2.40 | 171.84 | then |
| 170.16 | 4.16 | 174.32 | and i kind of like i mean i am moving |
| 171.84 | 4.16 | 176.00 | forward but it"s mostly that when i"m |
| 174.32 | 3.68 | 178.00 | stopping him |
| 176.00 | 3.52 | 179.52 | but when he"s stopping me that is |
| 178.00 | 3.44 | 181.44 | keep pushing me |
| 179.52 | 2.80 | 182.32 | that i"m disappearing see how i let go |
| 181.44 | 3.28 | 184.72 | of him |
| 182.32 | 4.48 | 186.80 | when he flew over me |
| 184.72 | 5.12 | 189.84 | okay and that that"s where my now you |
| 186.80 | 4.64 | 191.44 | know if i don"t clear his body |
| 189.84 | 3.28 | 193.12 | because he"s a good wrestler and i go to |
| 191.44 | 4.08 | 195.52 | take a shot and he touches me with his |
| 193.12 | 4.96 | 198.08 | chest then he"s just gonna stop me see |
| 195.52 | 3.44 | 198.96 | like that so yes i do have to lower my |
| 198.08 | 3.36 | 201.44 | level |
| 198.96 | 4.08 | 203.04 | and get up underneath him right but this |
| 201.44 | 3.44 | 204.88 | is wrestling he doesn"t have to give it |
| 203.04 | 3.28 | 206.32 | to me in fact he shouldn"t |
| 204.88 | 3.84 | 208.72 | i want it because it gives you but i can |
| 206.32 | 4.80 | 211.12 | tell you one thing if he"s backing up |
| 208.72 | 3.92 | 212.64 | and he doesn"t push back to me |
| 211.12 | 3.04 | 214.16 | it"s gonna be bad because what"s gonna |
| 212.64 | 4.16 | 216.80 | happen |
| 214.16 | 4.64 | 218.80 | is if he"s put i push it back in and |
| 216.80 | 3.04 | 219.84 | he"s and he"s just stalling if i take |
| 218.80 | 2.80 | 221.60 | the shot |
| 219.84 | 4.00 | 223.84 | i"m gonna be too far away |
| 221.60 | 4.00 | 225.60 | and he can just stuff me |
| 223.84 | 4.16 | 228.00 | you know and then like |
| 225.60 | 3.84 | 229.44 | nowadays you know i just made my life |
| 228.00 | 2.88 | 230.88 | so if you can"t get him to commit to |
| 229.44 | 4.16 | 233.60 | stop you |
| 230.88 | 4.96 | 235.84 | don"t take a shot okay i have to get him |
| 233.60 | 3.60 | 237.20 | to commit to stop me and my first move |
| 235.84 | 2.80 | 238.64 | and just like he did my first move is i |
| 237.20 | 2.88 | 240.08 | didn"t stop me |
| 238.64 | 3.12 | 241.76 | and then as soon as he stops me i"m |
| 240.08 | 3.92 | 244.00 | snapping the head |
| 241.76 | 4.56 | 246.32 | will he always go down no but when i |
| 244.00 | 3.76 | 247.76 | pull his head down and i let go his head |
| 246.32 | 3.04 | 249.36 | comes up |
| 247.76 | 3.44 | 251.20 | so i pulled it down and he"s pulling his |
| 249.36 | 3.76 | 253.12 | head back up that"s what i"m coming |
| 251.20 | 3.84 | 255.04 | under okay |
| 253.12 | 2.96 | 256.08 | and again this works for every shot |
| 255.04 | 3.04 | 258.08 | double leg |
| 256.08 | 4.96 | 261.04 | outside single everything |
| 258.08 | 4.72 | 262.80 | you can"t expect him |
| 261.04 | 3.76 | 264.80 | you know you need to just if if he"s |
| 262.80 | 4.40 | 267.20 | aggressive he"s pushing anything good |
| 264.80 | 4.08 | 268.88 | but you can"t take a shot without having |
| 267.20 | 3.44 | 270.64 | the good inside control because if he"s |
| 268.88 | 3.52 | 272.40 | got inside control and he"s dominating |
| 270.64 | 3.36 | 274.00 | all this aggressive movement i can"t |
| 272.40 | 3.76 | 276.16 | take a shot here |
| 274.00 | 5.28 | 279.28 | it"ll never work right so you can"t be |
| 276.16 | 4.64 | 280.80 | so anxious to get on a shot |
| 279.28 | 3.60 | 282.88 | that you don"t have the proper setup so |
| 280.80 | 5.12 | 285.92 | in here that"s all we"re focusing on |
| 282.88 | 5.92 | 288.80 | proper setup is watch his feet and if he |
| 285.92 | 4.72 | 290.64 | takes it commits to that that step and |
| 288.80 | 4.48 | 293.28 | infeed had obvious okay i"m doing it for |
| 290.64 | 4.08 | 294.72 | the camera but that big step |
| 293.28 | 2.64 | 295.92 | you anticipate that it"s going to happen |
| 294.72 | 3.20 | 297.92 | when you get better you"ll feel their |
| 295.92 | 3.36 | 299.28 | hips tilting okay but in the beginning |
| 297.92 | 3.36 | 301.28 | watch their feet you have a clear view |
| 299.28 | 3.84 | 303.12 | of them and so he"s watching me right |
| 301.28 | 4.32 | 305.60 | now he"s pushing me and i take a step |
| 303.12 | 4.56 | 307.68 | that"s when he"s going to snap me looks |
| 305.60 | 3.52 | 309.12 | so powerful that he just looks so |
| 307.68 | 3.60 | 311.28 | horrible right |
| 309.12 | 5.28 | 314.40 | and all that momentum spinning behind |
| 311.28 | 5.04 | 316.32 | chopping arm like so |
| 314.40 | 5.04 | 319.44 | that"s coming off with my energy pushing |
| 316.32 | 5.04 | 321.36 | back into them and everything judo |
| 319.44 | 3.36 | 322.80 | any jiu-jitsu moves that you do if your |
| 321.36 | 3.60 | 324.96 | arm dragging from the sitting position |
| 322.80 | 3.76 | 326.56 | here you know if you"ve ever done this |
| 324.96 | 3.04 | 328.00 | and you just like telegraph it you try |
| 326.56 | 3.12 | 329.68 | to pull somebody"s arms you can just |
| 328.00 | 3.68 | 331.68 | posture up and it doesn"t work you know |
| 329.68 | 3.52 | 333.20 | you have to commit |
| 331.68 | 3.76 | 335.44 | to pushing into them so that they push |
| 333.20 | 5.04 | 338.24 | back for it to look okay so that |
| 335.44 | 5.04 | 340.48 | create the motion first when they react |
| 338.24 | 5.84 | 344.08 | and so you"re in the driver"s seat of |
| 340.48 | 3.60 | 344.08 | creating all that motion |

all my traditional shots require that he's pushing into me and so if he's coming at me like a honey badger that's different okay so it's like because he's going to be all tight and everything and i didn't get a chance to get under but if we were just doing your typical wrestling we're trying to feel each other out and stuff if he's pushing me watching my feet here most people they take a big step to stop him okay and so if if he's pushing me watch my feet again and so he's pushing me and i have to stop him that's where he's that's when he you'll get better at feeling this but when when he's backing up back up he takes that step that's when you are anticipating he's going to push back and that's where all your classic shots come from and everything so if i want a high quality for example and i'm pushing him back and then he takes this big step okay that's when i disappear that's when he falls over me okay and he's gonna fall over because his weight was already transferred that way so and and it's gonna you're gonna have to practice all your shots knowing full well that in order and you're gonna be circling it's not gonna be linear like this you're gonna be all over the place but but if i'm here this way let's see watch he just doesn't snap down again when i push when he pushes into me and i take this big step that's when mom's off balance right and that's when he can really take advantage of that of that off balance so if he's not engaging with you we'll cover that uh in the next in the next video um that's a whole different thing because in wrestling don't worry about it because if he's not engaging with you he's going to get him for stalling over and over again it is common though in jiu jitsu and i'll talk about two different takedowns that i think will really help you with that but as a general rule though even if i want an outside shot right like an outside signal i have to get them to stop me and commit to pushing me because what's going to happen is i'm going to disappear under you right so if i pull in for example um so if i get him and i pull this right foot right it was because when i was pushing him and he stopped me right i pulled that that foot came forward and i was able to get to it okay um if he's really he's good about hiding his back leg because he sees that my right leg is forward so he never wants me to have that leg so it's not an option for me okay you can't be so hung up on i want that leg because i want to shoot an outside single dude if it's not there you can't do it he never gives it to me so so like if i'm here and i'm trying to pull that right leg forward he makes it really hard for it to get close so i'm going to probably have to push him and stop just going to this one because it's closer okay but notice it looks like i'm taking a huge penetration step and then and i kind of like i mean i am moving forward but it's mostly that when i'm stopping him but when he's stopping me that is keep pushing me that i'm disappearing see how i let go of him when he flew over me okay and that that's where my now you know if i don't clear his body because he's a good wrestler and i go to take a shot and he touches me with his chest then he's just gonna stop me see like that so yes i do have to lower my level and get up underneath him right but this is wrestling he doesn't have to give it to me in fact he shouldn't i want it because it gives you but i can tell you one thing if he's backing up and he doesn't push back to me it's gonna be bad because what's gonna happen is if he's put i push it back in and he's and he's just stalling if i take the shot i'm gonna be too far away and he can just stuff me you know and then like nowadays you know i just made my life so if you can't get him to commit to stop you don't take a shot okay i have to get him to commit to stop me and my first move and just like he did my first move is i didn't stop me and then as soon as he stops me i'm snapping the head will he always go down no but when i pull his head down and i let go his head comes up so i pulled it down and he's pulling his head back up that's what i'm coming under okay and again this works for every shot double leg outside single everything you can't expect him you know you need to just if if he's aggressive he's pushing anything good but you can't take a shot without having the good inside control because if he's got inside control and he's dominating all this aggressive movement i can't take a shot here it'll never work right so you can't be so anxious to get on a shot that you don't have the proper setup so in here that's all we're focusing on proper setup is watch his feet and if he takes it commits to that that step and infeed had obvious okay i'm doing it for the camera but that big step you anticipate that it's going to happen when you get better you'll feel their hips tilting okay but in the beginning watch their feet you have a clear view of them and so he's watching me right now he's pushing me and i take a step that's when he's going to snap me looks so powerful that he just looks so horrible right and all that momentum spinning behind chopping arm like so that's coming off with my energy pushing back into them and everything judo any jiu-jitsu moves that you do if your arm dragging from the sitting position here you know if you've ever done this and you just like telegraph it you try to pull somebody's arms you can just posture up and it doesn't work you know you have to commit to pushing into them so that they push back for it to look okay so that create the motion first when they react and so you're in the driver's seat of creating all that motion
