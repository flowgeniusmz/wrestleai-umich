David Taylor is up against it he's got to win this bout and another one to have a shot to defend his Olympic goal two in a row against Aaron Brooks is a really very very difficult task this is the match this crowd has been waiting for Aaron Brooks David Taylor Unstoppable Force meets the immovable object in 10 years separation and Taylor used to wow the crowds here in state col at the college level and he's done that internationally for everybody looking around the globe and American fans in particular and now Brooks bursting on the scene he's gotten it done at the age group level as well two-time age group World Champ including the U23 level last year won the 2023 national title as well that got him a best of three final series trip against David Taylor but Taylor SW those two bouts 6 nothing 54 but Brooks turning the tide and now Taylor coming out super aggressive with way more popping energy Jim than bout number one yeah that was his first match of the tournament came out a little bit flat not so tonight David Taylor says that he wants to wrestle a pace that nobody can keep up with but we all know that Aaron Brooks is a Relentless competitor nobody he yet been able to force him to uh to wilt in a match and like we saw with Kyle D and Jason KN earlier at 74 kg here at 86 kg 189 lb you got two guys from the same wrestling club same training room so no secrets here if you're David Taylor how do you go about maybe changing things up against the guy that's probably seen most if not all of your Arsenal no surprises just have to do what you do better than your your opponent because they both know what's coming Aaron Brooks fresh off an NCA Championship a few weeks ago David Taylor hasn't wrestled as many matches this year so there's some school of thought that Aaron Brooks is is on a role and maybe able to continue it through here we've seen hot wrestlers transition from NCA success one year into the Olympics you think of Jordan Burrows doing that in route to gold in London Jaden Cox did it after winning an NCA title in Missouri then came through the Challenge tournament won an Olympic trip and Olympic Bronze in Rio see the early blood time here in this period and you look at the history David Taylor among those who would have an opportunity to join this esteemed list of American wrestlers who have won multiple Olympic goals Helen maruis Kyle Snider already qual qualified looking to join that list but David Taylor could be another one who has that opportunity so certainly would put your name in the pantheon of American wrestling you already get that when you win Olympic gold but if you double it up in quite Elite company back at it here under two minutes left to go opening period we'll see who knock notches Score first Taylor doing a great job of getting on the head and sending some shots but Aaron Brooks with his underhooks he is Relentless with those [Music] things Aaron Brooks really good on his feet so far this match he looks really fresh good motion good movement good reactions native of Hagerstown Maryland Aaron [Music] Brooks more more blood time yeah oh the max shman calls him over for a little consultation not sure what what's happening there so they're cleaning the blood on the map but you talked about having a little conversation in powwow here well they give a caution and one for fleeing that may change the tenor of the match a bit David Taylor comes back to the middle and finds himself behind wow so they give a caution there and a penalty point awarded to Aaron Brooks so Taylor after all that activity now working from a deficit halfway through this opening 3-minute period again 6 minutes in total most points scored wins pin your opponent win by 10 or more you end it early right now Taylor just find to have more points than Brooks at this point in force of third round just totally disagree with that passivity warning Taylor's been the aggressor so far the whole match but he's in trouble here very tenuous [Music] [Applause] position round the scar able to turn the corner tack on two more and build the three nothing Advantage Brooks wanted to go back up and the referee obliges here we [Music] go Aaron Brooks a ton of confidence right now in this match David Taylor in a hole and has to get get moving and Taylor only generating one point on offense in round one and shut out to this particular point so far in round number two this would be somewhat of a stunner Aaron Brooks certainly a great pedigree but Taylor has been nearly Flawless recently in his career and especially against Americans coming in super hot his loss in the last bout his first loss to an American besides an injury default when he hurt his knee severely in 2019 his last loss to American came at the 2017 world team trials when he lost a couple of tight matches to Jaden Cox but right now he's in a deficit again against Aaron Brooks who got the penalty point and then scored a key to yeah he Taylor took a shot wasn't able to get a get a good finish position Brooks was able to come around Taylor trying to hang on but to no avail Brooks too strong keeps moving keeps moving stays with it able to take Taylor to the mat here for a two-point score so David Taylor trying to summon everything he's got to overcome Aaron Brooks who won The Challenge tournament including oh nice shot but again heavy hips by Aaron Brooks not allowing David Taylor to get in a position to finish but he keeps driving forward he can get in get his hips Underneath Him and now back to that heavy hips by Aaron Brooks staving off that attack by David Taylor certainly doing everything defensively to neutralize Tokyo Olympic gold medalist three-time World Champ including backto back World titles David Taylor took him a while to become the number one wrestler in the US but once he did totally dominant voted the best wrestler in the world by the United World Wrestling Federation after 2018 Al Don it took him six years to make his first senior level World team finished second or third at Olympic or World trials to people like Jordan Burrows jayton Cox World Champs but then he got that first world title in 2018 and the knee issue the following year but worked his way back and that year postponement of the Tokyo games probably aided his rehab from the knee issue even more and then he stormed his way to that gold with that great take down late to stun yazdani of Iran get to the top step of the podium in Tokyo but he's not going to get to Paris unless he finds a way to get at least a handful of points here against Aaron Brooks in the last 90 seconds of this period good action there by David Taylor Nice Shot referee calling for a passivity call against Aaron Brooks tells him to get moving but Brooks content to stay in that heading head and collar tie if David Taylor will let him no risk to him while he's there while he holds this wrist but he may get hit again he's on the clock 18 seconds left but with that three-point lead he doesn't need to do much he doesn't need to take a risk here if he doesn't want to seemingly going about his strategy cautiously and maybe willing to concede that penalty point to David Taylor 50 plus seconds left puts Taylor in a position to win this match though if he can get a two-point takedown I don't see the point going up on the board yet there it is a while to put it up it is up now and Taylor needs more than that to keep hopes alive of Defending his Olympic goal a single against Brooks switches to head outside but Brooks has got that head down Taylor's going to have to get his head up get his hips in he does maybe be able to finish this one back trip back trip but Brooks comes up on Brooks comes up on top and no score here if Taylor can Elevate that leg he can get a two-point turn he's got to do it now 10 seconds left the Tokyo Olympic gold medalist gets called to a stalemate back to the center with 8 seconds remaining the magic man looking to pull a rabbit out of his hat late and Aaron Brooks is the one who's going to push on to Paris Big Win huge win for Aaron Brooks making his first Olympic team your Olympic team Nom going to be the great respect from Aaron Brooks knocking out a defending Olympic gold medalist and a guy who has as good a shot as any to potentially continue a run of success for the United States at the Olympics he'll earn the birth for Team USA Aaron Brooks one of seven men to win four NCAA titles in college wrestling all time knocks out David Taylor
