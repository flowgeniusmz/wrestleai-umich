| 7.20 | 4.72 | 11.92 | make when they stand up and they"re |
| 8.64 | 5.08 | 13.72 | trying to get out first big mistake is |
| 11.92 | 3.60 | 15.52 | they"re either too far forward or |
| 13.72 | 3.52 | 17.24 | they"re getting their hips out too much |
| 15.52 | 3.84 | 19.36 | but I"m here I want to be in almost a |
| 17.24 | 4.40 | 21.64 | good wrestling stance right here this |
| 19.36 | 5.36 | 24.72 | way he can"t take me |

| 28.60 | 5.00 | 33.60 | I"m almost in a almost my stance pretty |
| 30.88 | 4.32 | 35.20 | much and the second key is people try to |
| 33.60 | 3.52 | 37.12 | fight this arm in the middle and they"re |
| 35.20 | 4.12 | 39.32 | not getting any pressure you got to move |
| 37.12 | 3.72 | 40.84 | it to either this hip or you got to move |
| 39.32 | 3.04 | 42.36 | it to this hip you can"t have it in the |
| 40.84 | 4.60 | 45.44 | middle if it"s here he"s going to bring |
| 42.36 | 4.60 | 46.96 | me straight back or lift me whatever so |

| 46.96 | 4.72 | 51.68 | stance I can push back on those hips get |
| 49.40 | 4.60 | 54.00 | it to one side and now from here I"m |
| 51.68 | 4.52 | 56.20 | breaking off just one hand I"m only |
| 54.00 | 6.24 | 60.24 | fighting one hand let head hands off I |
| 56.20 | 6.60 | 62.80 | cut M so again make sure you"re in good |
| 60.24 | 4.92 | 65.16 | stance you"re basically almost in your |
| 62.80 | 5.28 | 68.08 | stance and you want to fight the two |
