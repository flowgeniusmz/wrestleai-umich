| 21.96 | 4.16 | 26.12 | I want to go after uh there"s a lot of |
| 24.68 | 2.96 | 27.64 | different setups that you could possibly |
| 26.12 | 3.68 | 29.80 | use but I"m just going to go with a |

| 58.76 | 3.60 | 62.36 | where here"s foot is from here my quick |

| 64.56 | 5.20 | 69.76 | him backwards inside the knee back trip |
