| 0.03 | 5.58 | 5.61 | all right so we did all these finishes |
| 2.37 | 4.77 | 7.14 | or defensive techniques to when a guys |
| 5.61 | 2.67 | 8.28 | in on a high crotch and we"re on the mat |
| 7.14 | 2.94 | 10.08 | but we haven"t done anything from the |
| 8.28 | 4.26 | 12.54 | crackdown crackdown position is |
| 10.08 | 4.65 | 14.73 | extremely extremely common in both |
| 12.54 | 3.24 | 15.78 | freestyle and folk style so it"s |
| 14.73 | 2.97 | 17.70 | important that we know how to defend |
| 15.78 | 3.27 | 19.05 | once we"re in that position if you don"t |
| 17.70 | 2.52 | 20.22 | know the crackdown is I"m going to show |
| 19.05 | 3.90 | 22.95 | you right now it"s gonna kind of go over |
| 20.22 | 5.04 | 25.26 | the basics of it crackdown results from |
| 22.95 | 2.88 | 25.83 | a high crotch where I get into my high |
| 25.26 | 2.76 | 28.02 | crotch |
| 25.83 | 7.10 | 32.93 | I can either force this by kind of |
| 28.02 | 8.22 | 36.24 | coming low ankle here getting to here or |
| 32.93 | 7.21 | 40.14 | another way to get there is if I shoot |
| 36.24 | 5.52 | 41.76 | he pulls me into this crap so typically |
| 40.14 | 3.09 | 43.23 | crackdown position is that he"s on his |
| 41.76 | 4.65 | 46.41 | butt he"s gonna have his hands locked |
| 43.23 | 5.43 | 48.66 | here I"m in on this leg I have some |
| 46.41 | 4.32 | 50.73 | techniques I like a lot from the |
| 48.66 | 3.21 | 51.87 | offensive side of this that you can |
| 50.73 | 2.22 | 52.95 | check out but we"re going to focus on |
| 51.87 | 2.85 | 54.72 | the defensive side today |
| 52.95 | 4.20 | 57.15 | so basically Tony"s goal right now is |
| 54.72 | 3.75 | 58.47 | about to let me switch off to a double |
| 57.15 | 2.88 | 60.03 | if he"s just sitting here on his butt |
| 58.47 | 3.48 | 61.95 | and not really doing anything just put |
| 60.03 | 2.91 | 62.94 | your leg straight out my obviously is |
| 61.95 | 2.79 | 64.74 | gonna be able to switch off and get a |
| 62.94 | 3.99 | 66.93 | double so he"s kind of reacting here |
| 64.74 | 4.26 | 69.00 | just being in a solid defensive position |
| 66.93 | 3.81 | 70.74 | so I"m kind of stuck so this is what |
| 69.00 | 3.33 | 72.33 | we"ll call the crack down position he"s |
| 70.74 | 4.50 | 75.24 | the defensive guy on the offensive guy |
| 72.33 | 4.50 | 76.83 | here and a lot of people get stalemated |
| 75.24 | 3.72 | 78.96 | here because they don"t know what to do |
| 76.83 | 3.84 | 80.67 | on both sides of this I"m all kinds of |
| 78.96 | 3.72 | 82.68 | and defensive so we"ll focus a little |
| 80.67 | 4.32 | 84.99 | bit on our next couple finishes I want |
| 82.68 | 4.64 | 87.32 | to do from this defensive position in |
| 84.99 | 2.33 | 87.32 | the crackdown |
| 94.53 | 2.06 | 96.59 | you |
