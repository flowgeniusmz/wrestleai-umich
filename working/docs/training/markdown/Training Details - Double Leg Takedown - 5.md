| 0.03 | 4.32 | 4.35 | all right so now that we understand the |
| 2.01 | 4.29 | 6.30 | concepts of that basic outside two on |
| 4.35 | 4.22 | 8.57 | one what I"m going to do is just show |
| 6.30 | 4.35 | 10.65 | you guys my favorite setup from here |
| 8.57 | 4.30 | 12.87 | there"s a lot of different techniques |
| 10.65 | 4.74 | 15.39 | you can do with the two on one but again |
| 12.87 | 4.44 | 17.31 | in this fundamentals DVD I want you guys |
| 15.39 | 3.24 | 18.63 | have the basics down first before you |
| 17.31 | 3.18 | 20.49 | guys move on to a little bit more |
| 18.63 | 4.41 | 23.04 | advanced stuff but you have to |
| 20.49 | 4.17 | 24.66 | understand what a two-on-one is and just |
| 23.04 | 4.65 | 27.69 | kind of understand the basic concepts of |
| 24.66 | 6.09 | 30.75 | it so my favorite take down from that |
| 27.69 | 5.28 | 32.97 | outside to on what is a series of take |
| 30.75 | 4.20 | 34.95 | up I should say is using the lunch step |
| 32.97 | 5.88 | 38.85 | that we just learned and going from |
| 34.95 | 6.51 | 41.46 | there into our double a our high crotch |
| 38.85 | 5.31 | 44.16 | are single a finish from the double leg |
| 41.46 | 6.15 | 47.61 | lunge step but I"m gonna do it with a |
| 44.16 | 4.62 | 48.78 | set up from a to R so what I do another |
| 47.61 | 3.00 | 50.61 | important thing about getting this tone |
| 48.78 | 3.32 | 52.10 | when it"s first contact right supporting |
| 50.61 | 4.17 | 54.78 | here family it"s gonna be hard but |
| 52.10 | 6.52 | 58.62 | whistle blows like get first contact |
| 54.78 | 6.30 | 61.08 | given with two on one right away what I |
| 58.62 | 4.59 | 63.21 | noticed a lot for my two and one is a if |
| 61.08 | 4.23 | 65.31 | they don"t react at all I have a lot of |
| 63.21 | 6.06 | 69.27 | little easy options right come to his |
| 65.31 | 5.40 | 70.71 | legs go behind him he knows that as a |
| 69.27 | 2.67 | 71.94 | good opponent he"s not gonna want to be |
| 70.71 | 2.43 | 73.14 | there so a lot of times what they"ll do |
| 71.94 | 3.72 | 75.66 | is they"ll try to create space by |
| 73.14 | 4.68 | 77.82 | pushing on your head so when he toes |
| 75.66 | 4.86 | 80.52 | have pushed off the head it opens me up |
| 77.82 | 5.67 | 83.49 | perfectly for my lunch step so I want to |
| 80.52 | 5.37 | 85.89 | make sure I keep control of his arm |
| 83.49 | 4.41 | 87.90 | even if he"s pushing on my head now I"m |
| 85.89 | 4.47 | 90.36 | gonna do is I"m gonna pop his elbow and |
| 87.90 | 4.98 | 92.88 | change my direction so for my level |
| 90.36 | 6.39 | 96.75 | sorry just into that lunge step right |
| 92.88 | 6.48 | 99.36 | basic one step so you can see here I |
| 96.75 | 6.30 | 103.05 | didn"t really exaggerate stepping far |
| 99.36 | 5.46 | 104.82 | enough which is okay but could I have |
| 103.05 | 5.52 | 108.57 | him control but I wanted to even |
| 104.82 | 6.93 | 111.75 | exaggerate more at lunch step so as I |
| 108.57 | 3.87 | 112.44 | pop his arm now look at I stepped a |
| 111.75 | 3.51 | 115.26 | little bit farther |
| 112.44 | 5.25 | 117.69 | I"m keeping his arm if I can it"s bent |
| 115.26 | 5.37 | 120.63 | over me all I"m gonna do is a couple my |
| 117.69 | 4.80 | 122.49 | finishes cake first finish here just |
| 120.63 | 3.12 | 123.75 | once I beat this arm keep my head in it |
| 122.49 | 6.00 | 128.49 | I"m just gonna come up and go behind |
| 123.75 | 8.16 | 131.91 | like the death under I"m behind it very |
| 128.49 | 6.38 | 134.87 | very simple very effective so do |
| 131.91 | 2.96 | 134.87 | defender one more time |
| 135.39 | 5.35 | 140.74 | creating the opening on that side if you |
| 138.91 | 4.50 | 143.41 | keep control that arm like he wants to |
| 140.74 | 6.24 | 146.98 | fall over you which is really good for |
| 143.41 | 5.25 | 148.66 | you second move from this two-on-one is |
| 146.98 | 4.59 | 151.57 | I"m going to turn it into my double |
| 148.66 | 5.13 | 153.79 | eight so I pop now my hand that"s |
| 151.57 | 3.84 | 155.41 | controlling his arm same thing like we |
| 153.79 | 3.87 | 157.66 | did earlier the one step I"m just |
| 155.41 | 5.94 | 161.35 | dropping into his knee taking this one |
| 157.66 | 11.25 | 168.91 | it"s driving my health penetration step |
| 161.35 | 11.13 | 172.48 | and finish okay yeah boom take me money |
| 168.91 | 7.76 | 176.67 | l penetration step down finish don"t |
| 172.48 | 7.86 | 180.34 | worry hey op shake |
| 176.67 | 7.54 | 184.21 | another option is he pushes on my head |
| 180.34 | 4.50 | 184.84 | lunge step now earlier with the high |
| 184.21 | 3.27 | 187.48 | crotch |
| 184.84 | 4.77 | 189.61 | I switch to a single eight but here I"m |
| 187.48 | 6.12 | 193.60 | just gonna take my outside arm and I"m |
| 189.61 | 6.15 | 195.76 | gonna rotate as I pivot to the inside of |
| 193.60 | 4.23 | 197.83 | his leg pick him up |
| 195.76 | 5.37 | 201.13 | look at where we are in that same |
| 197.83 | 4.83 | 202.66 | position to do the corkscrew finish make |
| 201.13 | 3.72 | 204.85 | sure that when you get into that one"s a |
| 202.66 | 5.43 | 208.09 | really effective easy one we don"t have |
| 204.85 | 8.04 | 212.89 | to use a lot of explosion explosiveness |
| 208.09 | 8.63 | 216.72 | two on one pushes on my head lunge step |
| 212.89 | 6.15 | 219.04 | right this hand back here now instead of |
| 216.72 | 5.86 | 222.58 | stewing you from a high cross earlier |
| 219.04 | 7.77 | 226.81 | like earlier rather than just rotate my |
| 222.58 | 6.36 | 228.94 | head inside lift this leg pinch here and |
| 226.81 | 3.81 | 230.62 | then I"m gonna go to that corkscrew |
| 228.94 | 4.62 | 233.56 | finish which we"ve already learned in |
| 230.62 | 4.71 | 235.33 | our last segment of the DVD all right |
