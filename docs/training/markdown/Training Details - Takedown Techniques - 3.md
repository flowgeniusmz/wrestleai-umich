| 12.08 | 3.36 | 15.44 | little easier |
| 13.04 | 3.28 | 16.32 | to learn it should also be effective |
| 15.44 | 2.48 | 17.92 | meaning it works |
| 16.32 | 3.68 | 20.00 | at the elementary middle school high |
| 17.92 | 4.64 | 22.56 | school college and international level |
| 20.00 | 3.60 | 23.60 | and the blast double satisfies all of |
| 22.56 | 3.20 | 25.76 | these categories |
| 23.60 | 3.60 | 27.20 | if you think for a moment fire on my |
| 25.76 | 3.12 | 28.88 | feet how far do you think i could throw |
| 27.20 | 3.36 | 30.56 | a javelin |

| 33.60 | 4.48 | 38.08 | back so utility of wrestling the utility |
| 36.40 | 2.80 | 39.20 | of takedowns is the ability to take an |
| 38.08 | 3.52 | 41.60 | opponent where they |
| 39.20 | 3.20 | 42.40 | can generate their most power their most |
| 41.60 | 2.80 | 44.40 | dangerous |
| 42.40 | 3.68 | 46.08 | to their back where they can create |
| 44.40 | 3.52 | 47.92 | generate the least amount of power |
| 46.08 | 4.96 | 51.04 | their least dangerous and if you want to |
| 47.92 | 5.76 | 53.68 | have that ability as quickly as possible |
| 51.04 | 4.00 | 55.04 | start with a takedown that is most easy |
| 53.68 | 2.56 | 56.24 | to learn |
| 55.04 | 2.96 | 58.00 | okay guys if you"ve never hit a blast |
| 56.24 | 3.28 | 59.52 | double before have your partner stand at |
| 58.00 | 3.28 | 61.28 | scarecrow hands wide |
| 59.52 | 3.36 | 62.88 | feet wide then get down in your |
| 61.28 | 5.28 | 66.56 | wrestling stance push |
| 62.88 | 5.28 | 68.16 | off your back leg into a lunge step |
| 66.56 | 5.76 | 72.32 | your lead leg is going to step deep |
| 68.16 | 6.72 | 74.88 | between his legs |
| 72.32 | 2.56 | 74.88 | right to here |
| 76.08 | 3.44 | 79.52 | and your hands jut out like hooks on the |
| 78.56 | 2.96 | 81.52 | back of his knees |
| 79.52 | 3.68 | 83.20 | you want your widow"s peek right in the |
| 81.52 | 3.04 | 84.56 | middle of his gut right above his above |
| 83.20 | 2.40 | 85.60 | his belly button we"re not here we"re |
| 84.56 | 3.12 | 87.68 | not battering ramp |
| 85.60 | 4.56 | 90.16 | if my face is pointed down that"s where |
| 87.68 | 4.32 | 92.00 | i can go you can also stuff my head here |
| 90.16 | 3.36 | 93.52 | making life hard i"m up here like this i |
| 92.00 | 3.20 | 95.20 | don"t really have leverage with my neck |
| 93.52 | 3.76 | 97.28 | i want to marry the two be right in the |
| 95.20 | 3.64 | 98.84 | middle and then as i drive forward |
| 97.28 | 5.92 | 103.20 | pulling my elbows in |
| 98.84 | 6.52 | 105.36 | i t my head forward |
| 103.20 | 3.20 | 106.40 | now if i"m going to achieve this |
| 105.36 | 2.56 | 107.92 | position |
| 106.40 | 2.80 | 109.20 | i have to clear his hands out of the way |
| 107.92 | 2.08 | 110.00 | because he"s eventually going to be in a |
| 109.20 | 2.96 | 112.16 | stance |
| 110.00 | 3.60 | 113.60 | if i don"t clear his hands out of the |
| 112.16 | 3.84 | 116.00 | way they"re more than likely going to |
| 113.60 | 4.08 | 117.68 | catch me on the way in if i just shoot |
| 116.00 | 3.52 | 119.52 | right he can under hook me he can stop |
| 117.68 | 4.56 | 122.24 | me can sprawl i need to get him |
| 119.52 | 4.24 | 123.76 | thinking uh i need to create motion get |
| 122.24 | 3.04 | 125.28 | his hands moving out of the way |
| 123.76 | 3.60 | 127.36 | how can i do that without even having to |
| 125.28 | 2.96 | 128.24 | touch his hands i reach towards his face |
| 127.36 | 3.52 | 130.88 | i"m gonna take advantage of an |
| 128.24 | 4.08 | 132.32 | evolutionary trait evolutionary instinct |
| 130.88 | 3.84 | 134.72 | that when an object goes towards your |
| 132.32 | 3.44 | 135.76 | face you"re gonna try to protect your |
| 134.72 | 4.08 | 138.80 | face so |
| 135.76 | 8.08 | 143.84 | on my entry as i"m entering in |
| 138.80 | 5.04 | 143.84 | i camouflage my movement with this reach |
| 154.08 | 3.92 | 158.00 | so it"s as if i"m falling almost i"m |
| 156.16 | 4.08 | 160.24 | leaning over my lead leg |
| 158.00 | 3.68 | 161.68 | i"m leaning over my lead leg i give him |
| 160.24 | 3.92 | 164.16 | something to react to |
| 161.68 | 3.36 | 165.04 | push off your back leg your power leg |
| 164.16 | 3.76 | 167.92 | step |
| 165.04 | 4.32 | 169.36 | and pull your elbows back into your body |
| 167.92 | 3.04 | 170.96 | and then they jut out |
| 169.36 | 3.92 | 173.28 | here this is what a lot of you are going |
| 170.96 | 3.12 | 174.08 | to do you"re going to go here and then |
| 173.28 | 2.88 | 176.16 | you"re going to |
| 174.08 | 3.44 | 177.52 | windmill your arms because it"s going to |
| 176.16 | 3.12 | 179.28 | feel more comfortable at first you see |
| 177.52 | 3.04 | 180.56 | how narrow my legs are in my entry |
| 179.28 | 3.12 | 182.40 | it"s like you"re walking on a balance |
| 180.56 | 3.12 | 183.68 | beam so naturally if you"re not |
| 182.40 | 2.00 | 184.40 | developed here if you"re not comfortable |
| 183.68 | 1.84 | 185.52 | here |
| 184.40 | 2.96 | 187.36 | you"re going to be trying to catch your |
| 185.52 | 3.52 | 189.04 | balance and that"s why your hands |
| 187.36 | 3.04 | 190.40 | windmill out |
| 189.04 | 3.60 | 192.64 | fight that instinct and discipline |
| 190.40 | 2.96 | 193.36 | yourself if my if my elbows are out in |
| 192.64 | 2.08 | 194.72 | my shot |
| 193.36 | 3.60 | 196.96 | he"s just going to catch me and pull me |
| 194.72 | 4.48 | 199.20 | up right if my elbows are out |
| 196.96 | 3.28 | 200.24 | on my shot now he"s going to pull me up |
| 199.20 | 2.16 | 201.36 | and do under hooks and |
| 200.24 | 2.16 | 202.40 | we"re wrestling from there i don"t want |
| 201.36 | 12.48 | 213.84 | to be wrestling there i just want to get |
| 202.40 | 11.44 | 213.84 | a good clean take down |
| 219.84 | 3.44 | 223.28 | and the whole time like doing short |
| 221.28 | 2.64 | 223.92 | choppy steps keeping my feet underneath |
| 223.28 | 4.00 | 227.28 | me |

| 227.28 | 2.56 | 229.84 | chest |
| 228.08 | 4.24 | 232.32 | starts to get out in front of my lead |
| 229.84 | 4.08 | 233.92 | leg i"m gonna fall down with him he |
| 232.32 | 2.64 | 234.96 | could roll me through he could do any |
| 233.92 | 1.92 | 235.84 | number of things catch you in a |
| 234.96 | 4.08 | 239.04 | submission |
| 235.84 | 6.32 | 242.16 | you want to stay on your feet |
| 239.04 | 5.36 | 244.40 | with practice staying on your feet okay |
| 242.16 | 3.44 | 245.60 | if this is traditional wrestling you can |
| 244.40 | 4.00 | 248.40 | go down with him |
| 245.60 | 4.00 | 249.60 | work for a pin but uh for self-defense |
| 248.40 | 3.04 | 251.44 | and bjj you wanna |

| 296.80 | 3.44 | 300.24 | you have a nice padded ground that |
