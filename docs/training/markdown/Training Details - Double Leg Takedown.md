| 0.08 | 3.04 | 3.12 | in this video we"re going to be going |
| 1.24 | 4.00 | 5.24 | over five wrestling tricks that you guys |
| 3.12 | 3.96 | 7.08 | can do to win more wrestling matches I"m |
| 5.24 | 3.16 | 8.40 | jooy with my brother Carter here we"re |
| 7.08 | 3.00 | 10.08 | both actually rocking in the rest |
| 8.40 | 3.48 | 11.88 | boutiques these are the rest Boutique |
| 10.08 | 3.60 | 13.68 | skunks these are actually releasing |
| 11.88 | 3.60 | 15.48 | today on Black Friday when you guys are |
| 13.68 | 3.08 | 16.76 | watching so if they"re still in stock |
| 15.48 | 3.80 | 19.28 | click the link in the description and |
| 16.76 | 4.84 | 21.60 | get yourself a pair so trick number one |
| 19.28 | 4.44 | 23.72 | this is called mirroring I first learned |
| 21.60 | 4.16 | 25.76 | this uh my early days of high school and |
| 23.72 | 3.92 | 27.64 | because when a guy reaches up odds are |
| 25.76 | 3.52 | 29.28 | he"s going to reach up too when I put my |
| 27.64 | 4.04 | 31.68 | left hand out he"s going to counter it |
| 29.28 | 3.96 | 33.24 | with with his left hand and vice versa |
| 31.68 | 3.76 | 35.44 | so basically this is just what it looks |
| 33.24 | 3.88 | 37.12 | like as soon as I reach up his arms are |
| 35.44 | 4.40 | 39.84 | immediately going to come up and from |
| 37.12 | 4.60 | 41.72 | this I can of course react and go into |
| 39.84 | 4.00 | 43.84 | my shot so a lot of the times uh |
| 41.72 | 3.72 | 45.44 | especially at a start of the match or |
| 43.84 | 3.68 | 47.52 | really really late in the match when you |
| 45.44 | 4.36 | 49.80 | guys are lazy and tired so let"s just |
| 47.52 | 4.64 | 52.16 | say we shake hands start the match I |
| 49.80 | 4.88 | 54.68 | boom go up as soon as his hands go up I |
| 52.16 | 5.92 | 58.08 | can drw my levels as his hands go up |
| 54.68 | 4.92 | 59.60 | reach drop and go in on my double leg |
| 58.08 | 3.76 | 61.84 | now just I was saying later in a match |
| 59.60 | 3.84 | 63.44 | to when guys are tired we"re wrestling |
| 61.84 | 3.36 | 65.20 | here I"m pushing them pulling them |
| 63.44 | 3.60 | 67.04 | sometimes I like to collar tie bring him |
| 65.20 | 3.92 | 69.12 | in put put my Force against some |
| 67.04 | 4.72 | 71.76 | strength push him away and I back up a |
| 69.12 | 4.84 | 73.96 | little bit shake out I come back in boom |
| 71.76 | 4.16 | 75.92 | this is when I go in on my shot because |
| 73.96 | 3.56 | 77.52 | when guys get lazy that"s the best time |
| 75.92 | 3.56 | 79.48 | to go in especially when they"re tired |
| 77.52 | 3.28 | 80.80 | anyone can wrestle the first period the |
| 79.48 | 3.08 | 82.56 | second period but when you"re going the |
| 80.80 | 3.44 | 84.24 | full six s minutes into that third |
| 82.56 | 3.12 | 85.68 | period That"s when you break that"s when |
| 84.24 | 3.44 | 87.68 | you go into deep Waters that"s how to |
| 85.68 | 3.84 | 89.52 | get the take down using mirroring next |
| 87.68 | 3.76 | 91.44 | one here for trick number two this is |
| 89.52 | 3.92 | 93.44 | called the head roll I learned this one |
| 91.44 | 4.24 | 95.68 | at ason wrestling Academy they do this a |
| 93.44 | 3.80 | 97.24 | ton guys have had insane success with |
| 95.68 | 2.96 | 98.64 | this I"ve been doing this for now past |
| 97.24 | 3.56 | 100.80 | couple years and this is what it looks |
| 98.64 | 4.96 | 103.60 | like when a guy collar ties boom I meet |
| 100.80 | 4.92 | 105.72 | him with a hand automatically I go and |
| 103.60 | 4.08 | 107.68 | grab this elbow here on this elbow I can |
| 105.72 | 4.48 | 110.20 | control I can push it in I can pull it |
| 107.68 | 4.48 | 112.16 | out and go into my shots but also what I |
| 110.20 | 3.68 | 113.88 | what I"ve seen on Instagram too is kale |
| 112.16 | 3.80 | 115.96 | Sanderson if you guys know him never |
| 113.88 | 4.08 | 117.96 | lost a match in college he utilizes this |
| 115.96 | 4.20 | 120.16 | a lot so when guys collar tie what he |
| 117.96 | 4.24 | 122.20 | does he"s grabbing this but he"s rolling |
| 120.16 | 4.28 | 124.44 | his head onto the other side all I"m |
| 122.20 | 3.88 | 126.08 | doing is I"m replacing where his hand is |
| 124.44 | 3.76 | 128.20 | to my other side of my body I"m |
| 126.08 | 4.56 | 130.64 | literally replacing his hand from my |
| 128.20 | 5.28 | 133.48 | left shoulder all the way to the right |
| 130.64 | 4.24 | 134.88 | and from here this opens up an angle and |
| 133.48 | 3.56 | 137.04 | you guys know wrestling is all about |
| 134.88 | 4.12 | 139.00 | creating angles so you can see in here |
| 137.04 | 3.88 | 140.92 | if I go in on a shot he"s strong here |
| 139.00 | 4.04 | 143.04 | he"s going to back up and I can"t get to |
| 140.92 | 4.48 | 145.40 | that leg he"s strong here shoot I can"t |
| 143.04 | 3.92 | 146.96 | get to that leg but what can I do is I |
| 145.40 | 3.64 | 149.04 | have to break the separation and I have |
| 146.96 | 5.08 | 152.04 | to get an angle so one thing is I head |
| 149.04 | 4.68 | 153.72 | roll i b basically just dip my head and |
| 152.04 | 3.28 | 155.32 | as I"m doing this I can Circle my feet a |
| 153.72 | 4.12 | 157.84 | little bit too to make it easier on |
| 155.32 | 4.60 | 159.92 | myself and as soon as I do this I have |
| 157.84 | 4.16 | 162.00 | an opening from here you can push it |
| 159.92 | 4.76 | 164.68 | across and go into your high SE another |
| 162.00 | 5.52 | 167.52 | thing you could do is I fake and I come |
| 164.68 | 4.12 | 168.80 | back out hit my single leg or what I"ve |
| 167.52 | 3.00 | 170.52 | been kind of working on too is a head |
| 168.80 | 3.52 | 172.32 | roll and I kind of going right into like |
| 170.52 | 3.64 | 174.16 | a high dive kind of like more of like a |
| 172.32 | 4.48 | 176.80 | Greco move so in a match setting it kind |
| 174.16 | 2.64 | 176.80 | of looks like |
| 178.76 | 3.00 | 181.76 | this |
| 182.84 | 3.32 | 186.16 | and that is how to use the head roll |
| 184.32 | 3.64 | 187.96 | this works a lot guys play around with |
| 186.16 | 4.28 | 190.44 | this cuz this move Works trick number |
| 187.96 | 4.20 | 192.16 | three is we got the hand drag so similar |
| 190.44 | 3.48 | 193.92 | to the mirroring technique uh I"ve |
| 192.16 | 3.88 | 196.04 | noticed this when uh I was at a keino |
| 193.92 | 4.20 | 198.12 | tool Camp he showed this I know David |
| 196.04 | 3.88 | 199.92 | Taylor utilizes this as well so just |
| 198.12 | 3.12 | 201.24 | like mirroring if I reach up my hand |
| 199.92 | 3.04 | 202.96 | he"s going to reach up his hand and |
| 201.24 | 3.72 | 204.96 | counter right but what I want to do is |
| 202.96 | 3.12 | 206.08 | is I can reach and I already know he"s |
| 204.96 | 3.08 | 208.04 | going to reach so I"m going to grab his |
| 206.08 | 3.72 | 209.80 | hand right from here I can grab his hand |
| 208.04 | 3.08 | 211.12 | it doesn"t matter how you grab it of of |
| 209.80 | 2.88 | 212.68 | course all referees are different if you |
| 211.12 | 4.08 | 215.20 | grab the fingers or might call you for |
| 212.68 | 4.88 | 217.56 | stalling I reach up here I grab his hand |
| 215.20 | 4.76 | 219.96 | now from here what I can do is I roll I |
| 217.56 | 4.08 | 221.64 | can roll it out roll out the fingers and |
| 219.96 | 3.64 | 223.60 | then from here I can just go right into |
| 221.64 | 4.40 | 226.04 | my arm drag now another way on doing |
| 223.60 | 4.24 | 227.84 | this not only if you just catch the hand |
| 226.04 | 4.72 | 230.76 | but not even just the hand but you can |
| 227.84 | 5.12 | 232.96 | also catch the wrist here or if I put my |
| 230.76 | 4.28 | 235.04 | hand on his head his hand is going to |
| 232.96 | 5.32 | 238.28 | grab it right now here"s what I do I |
| 235.04 | 5.08 | 240.12 | drop my hand all like this I"m circling |
| 238.28 | 4.08 | 242.36 | my feet my head is going going on the |
| 240.12 | 4.48 | 244.60 | inside of his bicep and I"m pressuring |
| 242.36 | 4.96 | 247.32 | in and I"m picking up the leg dropping |
| 244.60 | 4.36 | 248.96 | down getting my single kicking his leg |
| 247.32 | 3.72 | 251.04 | and getting the taked down so once again |
| 248.96 | 4.64 | 253.60 | guys it"s not only if he just reaches up |
| 251.04 | 4.28 | 255.32 | I can grab this and go but also I can |
| 253.60 | 5.20 | 258.80 | fake him I"m using this hand on his head |
| 255.32 | 6.28 | 261.60 | as a fake from here drop it Circle and I |
| 258.80 | 6.36 | 265.16 | can go get the leg and take him down so |
| 261.60 | 3.56 | 265.16 | in a match setting it"ll look like |
| 268.60 | 3.00 | 271.60 | this |
| 272.08 | 3.80 | 275.88 | so that"s the hand drag super simple |
| 273.92 | 3.48 | 277.40 | super easy even if he doesn"t grab that |
| 275.88 | 3.00 | 278.88 | hand on your head at least you have |
| 277.40 | 3.48 | 280.88 | distance there you can work on your |
| 278.88 | 3.68 | 282.56 | fakes that"s a great way to take guys |
| 280.88 | 3.48 | 284.36 | down as well tip number four for |
| 282.56 | 4.56 | 287.12 | wrestling techniques is something I like |
| 284.36 | 5.04 | 289.40 | to call Happy Feet uh not like the 2006 |
| 287.12 | 4.36 | 291.48 | movie but uh in wrestling when when |
| 289.40 | 3.52 | 292.92 | you"re hand fighting sometimes you get |
| 291.48 | 3.44 | 294.92 | this big strong guy that"s just here |
| 292.92 | 3.80 | 296.72 | he"s like okay I"m strong I"m here but I |
| 294.92 | 3.36 | 298.28 | can"t I can"t get to his leg I can"t |
| 296.72 | 3.24 | 299.96 | reach I"m not really powerful I"m not |
| 298.28 | 3.72 | 302.00 | snapping him down wrestling is your |
| 299.96 | 3.48 | 303.44 | whole body it"s not just your upper body |
| 302.00 | 3.36 | 305.36 | it"s not just your lower body but |
| 303.44 | 4.08 | 307.52 | combining the two combining the Motions |
| 305.36 | 3.56 | 308.92 | you can see here the same movement when |
| 307.52 | 3.00 | 310.52 | I"m snapping on his head you"re going to |
| 308.92 | 3.56 | 312.48 | see me Circle my feet because my feet |
| 310.52 | 4.80 | 315.32 | are happy they"re always moving right so |
| 312.48 | 5.12 | 317.60 | now when I when I when I snap in it"s a |
| 315.32 | 4.20 | 319.52 | lot more pressure I get his feet moving |
| 317.60 | 4.16 | 321.76 | from here I can open up an angle so it"s |
| 319.52 | 4.44 | 323.96 | not just here banging trying to drive |
| 321.76 | 4.56 | 326.32 | the bus pressuring faking but what I do |
| 323.96 | 4.36 | 328.32 | is here I got to move my feet and I got |
| 326.32 | 4.72 | 331.04 | to Circle my feet Circle my feet from |
| 328.32 | 3.96 | 332.28 | here Circle my feet Circle my feet boom |
| 331.04 | 3.84 | 334.88 | things are going to get open it"s all |
| 332.28 | 4.08 | 336.36 | about creating spaces creating angles |
| 334.88 | 3.40 | 338.28 | and this is the best way to do it you |
| 336.36 | 3.88 | 340.24 | have to pick up your feet get stuck out |
| 338.28 | 3.76 | 342.04 | of the mud and get your takedown so in a |
| 340.24 | 4.04 | 344.28 | real match setting it"ll look something |
| 342.04 | 2.24 | 344.28 | like |
| 351.00 | 4.28 | 355.28 | this so there"s Happy Feet guys pick |
| 353.80 | 3.44 | 357.24 | your feet off the ground move your feet |
| 355.28 | 3.84 | 359.12 | and score some points last but not least |
| 357.24 | 3.84 | 361.08 | with trick number five this is something |
| 359.12 | 4.00 | 363.12 | I like to call the pause fake I first |
| 361.08 | 4.40 | 365.48 | learned about this last year and I did |
| 363.12 | 4.16 | 367.28 | it in my first match this past weekend |
| 365.48 | 3.64 | 369.12 | at the Finley open so this is one if I |
| 367.28 | 3.40 | 370.68 | go on a fake like I"m shooting but I"m |
| 369.12 | 3.04 | 372.16 | literally just going to stop I"m |
| 370.68 | 3.20 | 373.88 | literally just going to stop my motion |
| 372.16 | 4.04 | 376.20 | and a lot of times too this works if |
| 373.88 | 5.20 | 379.08 | you"re hitting the head but the what you |
| 376.20 | 4.00 | 380.20 | like come back up so when I usually fake |
| 379.08 | 2.88 | 381.96 | it looks something like this I"m like |
| 380.20 | 4.00 | 384.20 | faking I"m going in I"m faking I"m |
| 381.96 | 4.00 | 385.96 | coming back out what happens when I fake |
| 384.20 | 3.08 | 387.28 | but I stay put do you see how he"s |
| 385.96 | 3.96 | 389.92 | already standing up he didn"t even I |
| 387.28 | 4.88 | 392.16 | didn"t even tell him to stand up so what |
| 389.92 | 3.88 | 393.80 | you can do is by faking and staying low |
| 392.16 | 4.16 | 396.32 | when a guy stands up that"s when he go |
| 393.80 | 5.40 | 399.20 | shoot so I"m faking here I"m faking oh |
| 396.32 | 4.88 | 401.20 | he stands up going onto my shot taking |
| 399.20 | 4.48 | 403.68 | him down now in my match actually though |
| 401.20 | 4.44 | 405.64 | too I was just wrestling and I basically |
| 403.68 | 3.56 | 407.24 | just St this was I I had to get the |
| 405.64 | 3.20 | 408.84 | major right and I know I needed to |
| 407.24 | 3.56 | 410.80 | create action he was kind of wrestling |
| 408.84 | 3.96 | 412.80 | defensively so I wanted him to make a |
| 410.80 | 3.48 | 414.28 | mistake so so what I did in that match |
| 412.80 | 3.36 | 416.16 | is I was just wrestling and then I just |
| 414.28 | 3.32 | 417.60 | stopped and then I waited for him to |
| 416.16 | 3.24 | 419.40 | react I literally just froze and he was |
| 417.60 | 4.00 | 421.60 | like circling and then he took a bad sh |
| 419.40 | 4.76 | 424.16 | shot and when he takes a bad shot here I |
| 421.60 | 4.64 | 426.24 | can just defend right because I"m still |
| 424.16 | 4.16 | 428.32 | aware even though it looks like I"m lazy |
| 426.24 | 4.20 | 430.44 | doing something stupid playing mind |
| 428.32 | 3.72 | 432.04 | games especially late in the match |
| 430.44 | 3.80 | 434.24 | that"s what I use to get that taked down |
| 432.04 | 4.12 | 436.16 | and to get that major that pause fake |
| 434.24 | 6.28 | 440.52 | resting here I can use some fakes some |
| 436.16 | 6.36 | 442.52 | fakes when I fake Paw boom take him down |
| 440.52 | 3.76 | 444.28 | that"s the Paw fake so guys go try out |
| 442.52 | 3.04 | 445.56 | these five tricks uh they all work they |
| 444.28 | 3.12 | 447.40 | all work for me I wouldn"t be saying if |

## Transcript Text
in this video we're going to be going over five wrestling tricks that you guys can do to win more wrestling matches I'm jooy with my brother Carter here we're both actually rocking in the rest boutiques these are the rest Boutique skunks these are actually releasing today on Black Friday when you guys are watching so if they're still in stock click the link in the description and get yourself a pair so trick number one this is called mirroring I first learned this uh my early days of high school and because when a guy reaches up odds are he's going to reach up too when I put my left hand out he's going to counter it with with his left hand and vice versa so basically this is just what it looks like as soon as I reach up his arms are immediately going to come up and from this I can of course react and go into my shot so a lot of the times uh especially at a start of the match or really really late in the match when you guys are lazy and tired so let's just say we shake hands start the match I boom go up as soon as his hands go up I can drw my levels as his hands go up reach drop and go in on my double leg now just I was saying later in a match to when guys are tired we're wrestling here I'm pushing them pulling them sometimes I like to collar tie bring him in put put my Force against some strength push him away and I back up a little bit shake out I come back in boom this is when I go in on my shot because when guys get lazy that's the best time to go in especially when they're tired anyone can wrestle the first period the second period but when you're going the full six s minutes into that third period That's when you break that's when you go into deep Waters that's how to get the take down using mirroring next one here for trick number two this is called the head roll I learned this one at ason wrestling Academy they do this a ton guys have had insane success with this I've been doing this for now past couple years and this is what it looks like when a guy collar ties boom I meet him with a hand automatically I go and grab this elbow here on this elbow I can control I can push it in I can pull it out and go into my shots but also what I what I've seen on Instagram too is kale Sanderson if you guys know him never lost a match in college he utilizes this a lot so when guys collar tie what he does he's grabbing this but he's rolling his head onto the other side all I'm doing is I'm replacing where his hand is to my other side of my body I'm literally replacing his hand from my left shoulder all the way to the right and from here this opens up an angle and you guys know wrestling is all about creating angles so you can see in here if I go in on a shot he's strong here he's going to back up and I can't get to that leg he's strong here shoot I can't get to that leg but what can I do is I have to break the separation and I have to get an angle so one thing is I head roll i b basically just dip my head and as I'm doing this I can Circle my feet a little bit too to make it easier on myself and as soon as I do this I have an opening from here you can push it across and go into your high SE another thing you could do is I fake and I come back out hit my single leg or what I've been kind of working on too is a head roll and I kind of going right into like a high dive kind of like more of like a Greco move so in a match setting it kind of looks like this and that is how to use the head roll this works a lot guys play around with this cuz this move Works trick number three is we got the hand drag so similar to the mirroring technique uh I've noticed this when uh I was at a keino tool Camp he showed this I know David Taylor utilizes this as well so just like mirroring if I reach up my hand he's going to reach up his hand and counter right but what I want to do is is I can reach and I already know he's going to reach so I'm going to grab his hand right from here I can grab his hand it doesn't matter how you grab it of of course all referees are different if you grab the fingers or might call you for stalling I reach up here I grab his hand now from here what I can do is I roll I can roll it out roll out the fingers and then from here I can just go right into my arm drag now another way on doing this not only if you just catch the hand but not even just the hand but you can also catch the wrist here or if I put my hand on his head his hand is going to grab it right now here's what I do I drop my hand all like this I'm circling my feet my head is going going on the inside of his bicep and I'm pressuring in and I'm picking up the leg dropping down getting my single kicking his leg and getting the taked down so once again guys it's not only if he just reaches up I can grab this and go but also I can fake him I'm using this hand on his head as a fake from here drop it Circle and I can go get the leg and take him down so in a match setting it'll look like this so that's the hand drag super simple super easy even if he doesn't grab that hand on your head at least you have distance there you can work on your fakes that's a great way to take guys down as well tip number four for wrestling techniques is something I like to call Happy Feet uh not like the 2006 movie but uh in wrestling when when you're hand fighting sometimes you get this big strong guy that's just here he's like okay I'm strong I'm here but I can't I can't get to his leg I can't reach I'm not really powerful I'm not snapping him down wrestling is your whole body it's not just your upper body it's not just your lower body but combining the two combining the Motions you can see here the same movement when I'm snapping on his head you're going to see me Circle my feet because my feet are happy they're always moving right so now when I when I when I snap in it's a lot more pressure I get his feet moving from here I can open up an angle so it's not just here banging trying to drive the bus pressuring faking but what I do is here I got to move my feet and I got to Circle my feet Circle my feet from here Circle my feet Circle my feet boom things are going to get open it's all about creating spaces creating angles and this is the best way to do it you have to pick up your feet get stuck out of the mud and get your takedown so in a real match setting it'll look something like this so there's Happy Feet guys pick your feet off the ground move your feet and score some points last but not least with trick number five this is something I like to call the pause fake I first learned about this last year and I did it in my first match this past weekend at the Finley open so this is one if I go on a fake like I'm shooting but I'm literally just going to stop I'm literally just going to stop my motion and a lot of times too this works if you're hitting the head but the what you like come back up so when I usually fake it looks something like this I'm like faking I'm going in I'm faking I'm coming back out what happens when I fake but I stay put do you see how he's already standing up he didn't even I didn't even tell him to stand up so what you can do is by faking and staying low when a guy stands up that's when he go shoot so I'm faking here I'm faking oh he stands up going onto my shot taking him down now in my match actually though too I was just wrestling and I basically just St this was I I had to get the major right and I know I needed to create action he was kind of wrestling defensively so I wanted him to make a mistake so so what I did in that match is I was just wrestling and then I just stopped and then I waited for him to react I literally just froze and he was like circling and then he took a bad sh shot and when he takes a bad shot here I can just defend right because I'm still aware even though it looks like I'm lazy doing something stupid playing mind games especially late in the match that's what I use to get that taked down and to get that major that pause fake resting here I can use some fakes some fakes when I fake Paw boom take him down that's the Paw fake so guys go try out these five tricks uh they all work they all work for me I wouldn't be saying if they wouldn't otherwise if you guys do want to learn more wrestling one program that I've used is actually the peer wrestling online Training Academy this has been super beneficial to wrestlers all across the country and by using Code Caden you guys can stay 50% off so it's a great way to support me great way to get better at wrestling that's in the description below as well that was sick but actually we have one more challenge I'm going to challenge Carter to a best of three takedown match but before we go into this match with my brother have you guys ever
