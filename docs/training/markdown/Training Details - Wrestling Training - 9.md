| 0.16 | 3.20 | 3.36 | okay guys so we just went over a couple |
| 2.24 | 2.88 | 5.12 | takedowns from |
| 3.36 | 3.52 | 6.88 | clearing wrist ties or from when you |
| 5.12 | 2.32 | 7.44 | have wrists uh i"ve already mentioned |
| 6.88 | 2.56 | 9.44 | that |
| 7.44 | 3.76 | 11.20 | naturally we"re all wrestling from thai |
| 9.44 | 2.32 | 11.76 | a lot so it wasn"t something that i was |
| 11.20 | 2.88 | 14.08 | gonna |
| 11.76 | 3.92 | 15.68 | go over today another component of |
| 14.08 | 2.00 | 16.08 | wrestling is how to wrestle from open |
| 15.68 | 3.12 | 18.80 | space |
| 16.08 | 4.40 | 20.48 | and have shots from there so sometimes |
| 18.80 | 3.12 | 21.92 | maybe i"m really good at ties and i |
| 20.48 | 2.72 | 23.20 | really like ties so i think why do i |
| 21.92 | 2.56 | 24.48 | need an open shot |
| 23.20 | 2.96 | 26.16 | but one of these guys really good |
| 24.48 | 2.96 | 27.44 | defensively and they like wrestling from |
| 26.16 | 2.56 | 28.72 | thai and they"re clearing |
| 27.44 | 3.36 | 30.80 | and they"re you know keeping me at |
| 28.72 | 3.20 | 31.92 | assistance away faking a lot or |
| 30.80 | 4.00 | 34.80 | something and |
| 31.92 | 4.88 | 36.80 | they just they won"t engage right so i |
| 34.80 | 3.36 | 38.16 | think it always helps to be versatile so |
| 36.80 | 3.68 | 40.48 | if you have a shot from open |
| 38.16 | 3.36 | 41.52 | it"s just another tool of the toolbox |
| 40.48 | 1.76 | 42.24 | what i"m going to teach you today is a |
| 41.52 | 3.04 | 44.56 | little single |
| 42.24 | 3.92 | 46.16 | it"s one of my favorite moves because i |
| 44.56 | 3.76 | 48.32 | think it"s super low risk |
| 46.16 | 3.60 | 49.76 | and when it becomes muscle memory i |
| 48.32 | 3.76 | 52.08 | think it"s really easy to get |
| 49.76 | 4.00 | 53.76 | so what i"m going to have my partner do |
| 52.08 | 2.80 | 54.88 | for everyone that"s learning this |
| 53.76 | 3.92 | 57.68 | i"m going to have my partner stand |
| 54.88 | 4.64 | 59.52 | neutral square stance |
| 57.68 | 3.28 | 60.96 | right so this would be staggered stance |
| 59.52 | 2.96 | 62.48 | if they have one leg forward |
| 60.96 | 3.68 | 64.64 | i want them to stand neutral for the |
| 62.48 | 4.24 | 66.72 | sake of drilling this and learning this |
| 64.64 | 3.28 | 67.92 | and again for those of you that know |
| 66.72 | 2.88 | 69.60 | although single |
| 67.92 | 3.28 | 71.20 | follow along because maybe there"s some |
| 69.60 | 3.44 | 73.04 | parts of this that |
| 71.20 | 3.12 | 74.32 | you haven"t heard or learned before or |
| 73.04 | 2.96 | 76.00 | it"s always good to just |
| 74.32 | 3.36 | 77.68 | feel something once to feel it in your |
| 76.00 | 2.00 | 78.00 | body and see how it fits or works for |
| 77.68 | 2.00 | 79.68 | you |
| 78.00 | 3.76 | 81.76 | it"s either going to reinforce what you |
| 79.68 | 5.44 | 85.12 | like or you could learn something new so |
| 81.76 | 4.40 | 86.16 | i have my partners stan yeah stance |
| 85.12 | 3.20 | 88.32 | square |
| 86.16 | 3.44 | 89.60 | square stance all right so both of his |
| 88.32 | 3.04 | 91.36 | feet are together because i"m |
| 89.60 | 3.04 | 92.64 | picking which leg i want to go to all |
| 91.36 | 3.92 | 95.28 | right so |
| 92.64 | 4.48 | 97.12 | i like to load single on the same foot |
| 95.28 | 4.48 | 99.76 | that i need i like to low single |
| 97.12 | 4.32 | 101.44 | um that foot so my legs lean forward i |
| 99.76 | 5.76 | 105.52 | like to low cycle his left leg |
| 101.44 | 5.12 | 106.56 | all right so what i do and |
| 105.52 | 4.96 | 110.48 | i"m going to explain these things |
| 106.56 | 6.72 | 113.28 | they"re really specific points actually |
| 110.48 | 3.52 | 114.00 | really specific points all right drill |
| 113.28 | 2.24 | 115.52 | these |
| 114.00 | 3.36 | 117.36 | hundreds and hundreds of time until this |
| 115.52 | 4.64 | 120.16 | is muscle memory um |
| 117.36 | 4.16 | 121.52 | they"re super important i teach them at |
| 120.16 | 3.60 | 123.76 | camps all the time |
| 121.52 | 4.64 | 126.16 | and uh still sometimes i see kids just |
| 123.76 | 4.40 | 128.16 | forgetting certain ones of them so |
| 126.16 | 3.68 | 129.84 | these i just think are super super solid |
| 128.16 | 4.88 | 133.04 | so i"m in my skins |
| 129.84 | 4.24 | 134.08 | all right a low single is um i"m |
| 133.04 | 2.64 | 135.68 | lowering my level |
| 134.08 | 3.44 | 137.52 | and i"m i"m actually shooting straight |
| 135.68 | 2.40 | 138.08 | across right so there"s sweep singles |
| 137.52 | 2.32 | 139.84 | where i"m |
| 138.08 | 4.00 | 142.08 | turning my body or there"s just a |
| 139.84 | 2.56 | 142.40 | regular single where i"m shooting in all |
| 142.08 | 4.40 | 146.48 | right |
| 142.40 | 6.88 | 149.28 | this i really think about it"s |
| 146.48 | 3.92 | 150.40 | i lower my level all right and i have to |
| 149.28 | 4.16 | 153.44 | do this from distance |
| 150.40 | 4.40 | 154.80 | okay and my back foot okay is loaded all |
| 153.44 | 3.12 | 156.56 | right my hips are low |
| 154.80 | 3.76 | 158.56 | so when i say lower level and you go |
| 156.56 | 4.80 | 161.36 | like this that"s not |
| 158.56 | 3.60 | 162.16 | it"s not correct okay all body position |
| 161.36 | 10.48 | 171.84 | wrestling |
| 162.16 | 9.68 | 171.84 | is pretty similar |
| 172.80 | 2.08 | 174.88 | you |
