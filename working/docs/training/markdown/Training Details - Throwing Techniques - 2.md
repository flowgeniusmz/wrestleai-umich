| 41.37 | 3.36 | 44.73 | today right now he"s just got to go over |
| 42.60 | 5.19 | 47.79 | one of his favorite moves the arm throw |
| 44.73 | 5.22 | 49.95 | and so yeah Chase is gonna not take it |
| 47.79 | 3.90 | 51.69 | away here and show us the arm throw yeah |
| 49.95 | 4.05 | 54.00 | so this is this is this is a fun move I |
| 51.69 | 4.92 | 56.61 | learned this growing up by United judo |
| 54.00 | 4.47 | 58.47 | growing up and then translate over to |
| 56.61 | 4.35 | 60.96 | wrestling great move for freestyle |
| 58.47 | 5.79 | 64.26 | especially can work and post folk style |
| 60.96 | 4.23 | 65.19 | but great opportunity score for points |
| 64.26 | 3.15 | 67.41 | so we"re gonna talk you through some of |
| 65.19 | 3.60 | 68.79 | the main points we go to this side |
| 67.41 | 2.70 | 70.11 | a couple things are really important |
| 68.79 | 3.36 | 72.15 | when I"m doing an arm throw one thing I |
| 70.11 | 3.33 | 73.44 | like to do when I"m just kind of |
| 72.15 | 3.00 | 75.15 | starting to set this up and starting to |
| 73.44 | 4.50 | 77.94 | go through this is really working the |
| 75.15 | 4.23 | 79.38 | leg pull my opponent pull my partner |
| 77.94 | 3.21 | 81.15 | towards me to get him leaning forward I |
| 79.38 | 3.93 | 83.31 | can"t throw somebody if they"re if |
| 81.15 | 3.63 | 84.78 | they"re standing too far up and if their |
| 83.31 | 3.45 | 86.76 | hips underneath them if they"re in good |
| 84.78 | 3.27 | 88.05 | position fans are good wrestling stances |
| 86.76 | 3.81 | 90.57 | can be really hard for me to throw him |
| 88.05 | 4.32 | 92.37 | so I have to get them leaning forward |
| 90.57 | 4.35 | 94.92 | pull them leaning forward leaning |
| 92.37 | 4.62 | 96.99 | forward okay the other thing that"s a |
| 94.92 | 4.11 | 99.03 | part of this is my back step so before I |
| 96.99 | 4.17 | 101.16 | go here I"m gonna back step I"m gonna |
| 99.03 | 3.90 | 102.93 | keep my arm short right here on my throw |
| 101.16 | 3.15 | 104.31 | some keep my arms shorting the stroke |
| 102.93 | 3.27 | 106.20 | here and then I"m gonna do this back |
| 104.31 | 4.02 | 108.33 | step I"m gonna drop both knees not just |
| 106.20 | 5.22 | 111.42 | one I"m gonna drop the both knees keep |
| 108.33 | 4.41 | 112.74 | my chest high okay you might keep my |
| 111.42 | 3.33 | 114.75 | chest high that"s gonna allow me to pop |
| 112.74 | 3.54 | 116.28 | them through when I throw them and the |
| 114.75 | 2.70 | 117.45 | other pieces I don"t want to roll |
| 116.28 | 3.75 | 120.03 | forward |
| 117.45 | 7.34 | 124.79 | this visit so what I want to stay high |
| 120.03 | 7.71 | 127.74 | up here get a good little snap and throw |
| 124.79 | 4.45 | 129.24 | so that"s hard to show its emotion so |
| 127.74 | 4.14 | 131.88 | I"m gonna show you three times here I"m |
| 129.24 | 4.50 | 133.74 | gonna show you once we"ll go through it |
| 131.88 | 5.18 | 137.06 | and talk to talk a little bit more |
| 133.74 | 12.57 | 146.31 | technique so I"ll pull down over here |
| 137.06 | 11.44 | 148.50 | throw one more more throw here so great |
| 146.31 | 4.53 | 150.84 | move for freestyle great option to go |
| 148.50 | 4.02 | 152.52 | and score points with I was good after |
| 150.84 | 3.36 | 154.20 | one there but one thing I"ve noticed |
| 152.52 | 2.97 | 155.49 | sitting that chased us here I"ve had to |
| 154.20 | 3.30 | 157.50 | hit this hump me a lot of times in |
| 155.49 | 5.16 | 160.65 | practice it never gets any more fun or |
| 157.50 | 5.64 | 163.14 | less painful but one thing if you notice |
| 160.65 | 4.20 | 164.85 | when I chase is pulling in my arm here |
| 163.14 | 3.72 | 166.86 | and holding it towards his chest he"s |
| 164.85 | 3.78 | 168.63 | keeping that in tight the entire time |
| 166.86 | 3.84 | 170.70 | all right if he"s creating space here |
| 168.63 | 3.54 | 172.17 | and he goes to try to step in it"s gonna |
| 170.70 | 3.78 | 174.48 | be really hard I"m just too far away |
| 172.17 | 3.96 | 176.13 | there"s a lot of hip separation there so |
| 174.48 | 3.75 | 178.23 | Chase is doing a really good job pulling |
| 176.13 | 4.74 | 180.87 | this in tight and then again when he was |
| 178.23 | 4.52 | 182.75 | say they pull me in and get me to lean |
| 180.87 | 4.53 | 185.40 | into him and now he"s got this loaded up |
| 182.75 | 15.28 | 198.03 | and you can pop his hips in and throw me |
| 185.40 | 13.80 | 199.20 | over top yeah so again guys taste Pandey |
