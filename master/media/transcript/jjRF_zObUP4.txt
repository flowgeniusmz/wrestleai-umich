to wrestle on yeah that's true all right here we go [Applause] [Music] all right here we go 86 kilograms match number one in the blue that's Aaron Brooks Nittany Lion wrestling club also Nittany Lion in the red Olympic champion David Taylor [Applause] and they Collide there David I don't think it's an eye poke I think this is like uh last time I saw David like that was the world championships in 2018 yeah and there's a replay there we go all right well they're back to Center under what wrist control there for Aaron Brooks [Applause] Brooks gonna try to make his Pace a factor in this way Aaron Brooks predicted a pretty tactical match between he and Taylor basically it was like David knows he's not going to be able to gas me out so I don't expect him to try to use his Pace like he does in so many other matches think about that Valencia matchup where David utilizes Pace as did Aaron Brooks in the U.S Open final and David definitely controlling center right now there's that underhook there Brooks and they're gonna hit Aaron's for passivity the first warning underhook on the right side that's what's interesting about Aaron normally you see a guy that's prolific underhooker they typically focus on one side Aaron will operate from both sides of the body who's left earlier now right side Aaron works so hard to progress through the hand fight really methodical whether he's on that collar or working towards the underhook Aaron's already a three-time NCAA Champion with one year of Eligibility remaining plans to move up to 100 197 pound weight class and they're gonna hit Aaron for passivity again he's going on the shot clock he'll have 30 to score or David will jump out to a 1-0 lead Brooks has gotten to this underhook 200 times but Taylor has maintained head position every time very good head position driving he's nice and low as David Taylor all volunteers shot clock at 20 seconds and climbing 10 more seconds and David will secure that first point and the point goes up David and Lee then he takes an attack shoots Shallow Lake Attack One More Shot for David trying to get his offense up good Savvy defense there from Brooks able to square his hips come back up to their feet Taylor gets that attack on most everybody [Applause] [Music] now they're going to indicate passivity on Taylor first call on him and they'll typically see them do that after they give him a shot clock they'll hit the other wrestler if there's not a lot of action going on no points going up that way they have the option put him on the clock in that second period really does seem though that Taylor's been maintaining Center 100 surprised to see that it's more it's less about that after that first shot clock point they just like to put the other guy on now another shot from David Taylor and it he's taken basically all the attacks at this point we're coming up on the final 10 seconds David sneaks a peek at the clock knows he can just hang out in this over under position as the first period ends actually I started walking back for like two seconds to go you know that last attack of Taylor Brooks hits that whizzer like a guy who's felt that very attack before he seems very familiar with David Taylor's attacks there was some question who would be in each guy's corner kale Sanderson and Bo nickel for Aaron Brooks Jake Varner Jimmy Kennedy for David Taylor [Music] [Applause] and we're back underway period number two just a 1-0 lead for David Taylor but the second periods are always his his period and there he's in on a shot High crotch now circling Brooks able to defend wow and now looking for a step out but good job circling around from David Taylor Furious Pace to start the second period incredible defense Again by Brooks Taylor normally gets that DP runs through you yeah incredible hit from Brooks great defense and Matt Savvy able to knock it up the step out then he almost had to step out where David showed off how positionally where he was able to Circle back incredible sequence there the official is indicating action against Brooks and so he's gonna go back on the clock so two times on the clock but for David he's been controlling Center more and he's been more overall active as well so I don't think this is incorrect no I agree Taylor not only maintaining Center but really deep attack it's the right call so if Brook's game plan was win on a second shot clock and when his favorite it's not gonna happen no collar tie for Brooks now head position there for Davis he circles second Point gonna go up on the board for Taylor but Brooks still just one takedown away from uh now David brings towards the edge again we haven't seen really many offensive attacks there's one that won a re-attack from David Taylor but now sprawl from Aaron Brooks now trying to build off Crackdown position for David Taylor and he's going to finish great sequence there from David Taylor 40-60 what a sequence from both wrestlers David Taylor so deep Aaron Brooks hit all the way over but it was the second ever from David Taylor that ends up earning him the takedown and then the turn on top of that and we saw Dave earlier so dangerous David Taylor in the same way and the scary thing about David Taylor we watched him at the World Championships last September we're like this is the best he's ever looked we're never in his greatest he's been through his career he dominated Hassan yazdani of an Olympic champion and multiple world champion from Iran and David seemed to just continue to improve and add to his game and now he's up 6-0 against a very very tough Aaron Brooks see that Pace slow in here from both guys and Brooks in his head maybe thinking it's time to regroup for match number two and Aaron Brooks how do you how do you get to a takedown on this guy yeah he has not given himself many opportunities that's for sure and David knows he can kind of relax a little cut behind the right shoulder David Taylor from I'm assuming we're Aaron digs those under hooks but that's how match number one is going to conclude 6-0 for David Taylor he's a match away from making yet another world team really incredible defense there from Aaron Brooks for most of the match but all David Taylor needed was the one sequence two and two punches his ticket to well they're no taking he's got no tickets no tickets he's got no ticket but he's one match away from the ticket
