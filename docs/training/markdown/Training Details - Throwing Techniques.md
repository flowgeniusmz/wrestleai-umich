| 21.72 | 3.57 | 25.29 | know most of you know an arm throw but |

| 25.29 | 6.09 | 31.38 | okay this is gonna be a reverse arm |
| 27.96 | 4.92 | 32.88 | throw from two-in-one super cool they |
| 31.38 | 2.70 | 34.08 | don"t expect it again just like most of |
| 32.88 | 3.45 | 36.33 | our moves they don"t expect it and |
| 34.08 | 3.51 | 37.59 | that"s what makes those moves so awesome |
| 36.33 | 3.66 | 39.99 | and that"s what makes them work so well |
| 37.59 | 4.17 | 41.76 | but here it is with people two on one |
| 39.99 | 3.63 | 43.62 | ok and then he"s fighting here is he"s |
| 41.76 | 3.45 | 45.21 | grabbing my elbow he"s pulling me it |
| 43.62 | 3.99 | 47.61 | doesn"t really matter if it has my elbow |
| 45.21 | 3.45 | 48.66 | or not but this is more difficult to do |

| 55.14 | 6.39 | 61.53 | lock right here I switch I rotate and I |
| 58.17 | 6.99 | 65.16 | go on top so it"s a reverse lock ok |
| 61.53 | 5.79 | 67.32 | rotate and go on top here now what I do |
