| 0.16 | 2.80 | 2.96 | okay now that you"ve conditioned your |
| 1.44 | 2.96 | 4.40 | legs and a wrestling stance and you know |
| 2.96 | 3.36 | 6.32 | at least one basic takedown |
| 4.40 | 3.36 | 7.76 | you know what you"re aiming for okay so |
| 6.32 | 3.20 | 9.52 | let"s talk about actions |
| 7.76 | 2.88 | 10.64 | and reactions from our stance even if |
| 9.52 | 2.56 | 12.08 | you don"t have a wide grappling |
| 10.64 | 2.56 | 13.20 | knowledge or a wide array of takedowns |
| 12.08 | 3.36 | 15.44 | in your arsenal yet |
| 13.20 | 3.84 | 17.04 | working on these actions and reactions |
| 15.44 | 2.24 | 17.68 | will develop neural pathways in your |
| 17.04 | 2.48 | 19.52 | brain |
| 17.68 | 3.68 | 21.36 | and develop muscle motion and movement |
| 19.52 | 3.60 | 23.12 | so when you go to learn other takedowns |
| 21.36 | 3.68 | 25.04 | they will come more easily there"s real |
| 23.12 | 3.68 | 26.80 | value to doing stance and motion work |
| 25.04 | 3.68 | 28.72 | it"s wrestling"s equivalent to shadow |
| 26.80 | 3.76 | 30.56 | boxing the basic movements of your |
| 28.72 | 5.04 | 33.76 | actions and reactions from your stance |
| 30.56 | 6.96 | 37.52 | the drop step |
| 33.76 | 8.00 | 41.76 | the sprawl the head position |
| 37.52 | 5.84 | 43.36 | block and the down block with your hands |
| 41.76 | 2.96 | 44.72 | one of the most basic foundational |
| 43.36 | 2.08 | 45.44 | movements in all of wrestling and |
| 44.72 | 3.04 | 47.76 | grappling |
| 45.44 | 4.08 | 49.52 | is your penetration step or your drop |
| 47.76 | 3.44 | 51.20 | step i"m stepping |
| 49.52 | 3.36 | 52.88 | deep closing the distance between my |
| 51.20 | 3.28 | 54.48 | partner and i and then my knee is |
| 52.88 | 4.08 | 56.96 | driving down to the ground |
| 54.48 | 4.08 | 58.56 | my chest stays over my lead leg knee |
| 56.96 | 2.16 | 59.12 | this allows me to cover distance at a |
| 58.56 | 2.32 | 60.88 | very low |
| 59.12 | 3.12 | 62.24 | safe angle getting underneath his head |
| 60.88 | 3.92 | 64.80 | hands defense |
| 62.24 | 4.40 | 66.64 | so he"s in a good stance i need to get |
| 64.80 | 4.24 | 69.04 | underneath i need to get low |
| 66.64 | 3.28 | 69.92 | right and my drop step helps me achieve |
| 69.04 | 3.92 | 72.96 | that i |
| 69.92 | 4.40 | 74.32 | step my knee is over my chest is over my |
| 72.96 | 3.60 | 76.56 | knee my elbows are in |
| 74.32 | 3.44 | 77.76 | my knees going to drive down between his |
| 76.56 | 4.32 | 80.88 | legs |
| 77.76 | 4.40 | 82.16 | and then my chest comes up head up hips |
| 80.88 | 1.84 | 82.72 | in back straight you"re going to hear |
| 82.16 | 2.32 | 84.48 | that |
| 82.72 | 3.84 | 86.56 | on every single technique video about |
| 84.48 | 6.00 | 90.48 | shooting head up hips and |
| 86.56 | 6.08 | 92.64 | back straight right so how we drill this |
| 90.48 | 4.40 | 94.88 | um how we drill this if you"re just |
| 92.64 | 4.24 | 96.88 | doing stance in motion |
| 94.88 | 3.04 | 97.92 | stay down low stance step forward center |
| 96.88 | 2.80 | 99.68 | line |
| 97.92 | 3.52 | 101.44 | down in the stance step forward center |
| 99.68 | 4.56 | 104.24 | line knee goes down |
| 101.44 | 3.84 | 105.28 | over my toe then i repeat the process |
| 104.24 | 2.80 | 107.04 | with my other leg |
| 105.28 | 4.32 | 109.60 | and you get this marching motion where |
| 107.04 | 2.56 | 109.60 | you"re just going |
| 110.40 | 4.24 | 114.64 | back and forth start coordinating your |
| 112.72 | 3.20 | 115.92 | arms now with the movement |
| 114.64 | 3.36 | 118.00 | act as if there"s someone there"s |
| 115.92 | 3.84 | 119.76 | someone in front of you so as |
| 118.00 | 3.52 | 121.52 | my knee drives over my toe and it"s |
| 119.76 | 3.20 | 122.96 | about to hit the ground that"s about |
| 121.52 | 4.08 | 125.60 | when i would be pulling |
| 122.96 | 3.20 | 126.16 | my hands or pulling his legs in towards |
| 125.60 | 2.88 | 128.48 | my body |
| 126.16 | 3.68 | 129.84 | my head would come up and i can repeat |
| 128.48 | 4.48 | 132.96 | the motion |
| 129.84 | 3.12 | 132.96 | with the other leg |
| 133.28 | 3.44 | 136.72 | and you can get in a nice long field you |
| 136.24 | 3.12 | 139.36 | can get |
| 136.72 | 3.20 | 139.92 | on the carpet inside maybe get some knee |
| 139.36 | 2.88 | 142.24 | pads |
| 139.92 | 3.44 | 143.36 | go slow wear some sweatpants if you"re |
| 142.24 | 3.20 | 145.44 | stuck inside |
| 143.36 | 3.28 | 146.64 | and just go slow right you want to get |
| 145.44 | 3.68 | 149.12 | very very comfortable |
| 146.64 | 4.08 | 150.72 | with this drop step it"s if you"re a bjj |
| 149.12 | 2.80 | 151.92 | guy it"s all it"s a lot like shrimping |
| 150.72 | 3.12 | 153.84 | it"s one of the most foundational |
| 151.92 | 3.76 | 155.68 | movements you"re going to find yourself |
| 153.84 | 3.20 | 157.04 | using again and again and again in many |
| 155.68 | 2.56 | 158.24 | different takedowns so |
| 157.04 | 3.28 | 160.32 | if you want to get proficient at your |
| 158.24 | 4.40 | 162.64 | takedowns get better your takedowns |
| 160.32 | 3.12 | 163.44 | just mastering or getting better at this |
| 162.64 | 2.08 | 164.72 | movement |
| 163.44 | 3.12 | 166.56 | the drop step is going to greatly |
| 164.72 | 5.25 | 169.97 | increase your chances and your success |
| 166.56 | 6.51 | 173.07 | rate and your takedowns |
| 169.97 | 3.10 | 173.07 | [Music] |
| 175.92 | 4.00 | 179.92 | now what"s the defensive equivalent to |
| 177.52 | 3.92 | 181.44 | our drop step that would be our sprawl |
| 179.92 | 3.28 | 183.20 | so if our partner is using a drop step |
| 181.44 | 2.64 | 184.08 | to shoot at our legs how do we defend |
| 183.20 | 3.28 | 186.48 | that a sprawl |
| 184.08 | 3.84 | 187.92 | right so alex is taking a deep step his |
| 186.48 | 2.24 | 188.72 | knees going over his toes doing a good |
| 187.92 | 3.44 | 191.36 | drop step |
| 188.72 | 3.68 | 192.40 | and he"s getting sorry to my legs what i |
| 191.36 | 3.84 | 195.20 | have to do here |
| 192.40 | 4.16 | 196.56 | is sprawl three things have to happen my |
| 195.20 | 3.68 | 198.88 | legs have to go back |
| 196.56 | 3.76 | 200.32 | my hips have to go in and his head has |
| 198.88 | 3.76 | 202.64 | to go down |
| 200.32 | 3.52 | 203.84 | okay i have to get my hands on if we |
| 202.64 | 4.16 | 206.80 | were facing |
| 203.84 | 3.92 | 207.76 | camera here i push on the top of his |
| 206.80 | 4.40 | 211.20 | head |
| 207.76 | 5.84 | 213.60 | my feet go back and my hips go in |
| 211.20 | 2.40 | 213.60 | this one |
| 214.88 | 4.96 | 219.84 | to here my hips go in okay i"m fighting |
| 218.00 | 4.48 | 222.48 | pressure with pressure |
| 219.84 | 3.44 | 223.28 | if i don"t push my hips in and he"s |
| 222.48 | 3.04 | 225.52 | driving through |
| 223.28 | 3.68 | 226.96 | and my and i simply just push here and |
| 225.52 | 2.80 | 228.32 | try to get my legs back but my hips |
| 226.96 | 2.40 | 229.36 | don"t come in he"s eventually going to |
| 228.32 | 2.88 | 231.20 | catch up to me |
| 229.36 | 3.36 | 232.72 | okay i have to meet pressure with |
| 231.20 | 5.04 | 236.24 | pressure so as soon as he gets in |
| 232.72 | 6.12 | 238.84 | i hip in legs back head down |
| 236.24 | 4.46 | 240.70 | get in your foot headlock just stuff the |
| 238.84 | 5.01 | 243.85 | shot |
| 240.70 | 3.15 | 243.85 | [Music] |
| 246.33 | 3.10 | 249.43 | [Music] |
| 252.80 | 2.80 | 255.60 | you put your laces on the mat even if |
| 254.56 | 2.40 | 256.96 | you"re not wearing shoes you know your |
| 255.60 | 4.48 | 260.08 | laces would be |
| 256.96 | 4.64 | 261.60 | put your laces on the mat right if my |
| 260.08 | 3.12 | 263.20 | toes are on the mat |
| 261.60 | 4.64 | 266.24 | and then i"m putting a post here for him |
| 263.20 | 5.28 | 268.48 | to drive into right i want to slide |
| 266.24 | 3.20 | 269.44 | if he starts driving at all i want to |
| 268.48 | 2.56 | 271.04 | slide |
| 269.44 | 3.84 | 273.28 | and that"ll also help position my hips |
| 271.04 | 4.64 | 275.68 | to push in more |
| 273.28 | 4.32 | 277.60 | high level rustlers though know that |
| 275.68 | 3.12 | 278.80 | there"s an additional layer of defense |
| 277.60 | 2.80 | 280.40 | actually two layers |
| 278.80 | 3.28 | 282.08 | of additional defense before you |
| 280.40 | 5.36 | 285.76 | actually sprawl it"s your |
| 282.08 | 5.36 | 287.44 | head defense and hands defense |
| 285.76 | 3.76 | 289.52 | what you want to think about is keeping |
| 287.44 | 3.52 | 290.96 | your head level just a half inch below |
| 289.52 | 3.20 | 292.72 | his at all times |
| 290.96 | 3.68 | 294.64 | then he has to pass through your line of |
| 292.72 | 3.60 | 296.32 | vision just to get to your leg so what |
| 294.64 | 2.32 | 296.96 | do i mean by that we"re in stance facing |
| 296.32 | 2.48 | 298.80 | each other |
| 296.96 | 3.36 | 300.32 | and we"re even he can slip underneath me |
| 298.80 | 2.32 | 301.12 | i just keep my eyeline half inch |
| 300.32 | 2.72 | 303.04 | underneath his |
| 301.12 | 3.36 | 304.48 | so when he goes to shoot he passes |
| 303.04 | 3.28 | 306.32 | through my eyeline |
| 304.48 | 4.00 | 308.48 | and i can just meet him with my head |
| 306.32 | 4.48 | 310.80 | right and i don"t even have to sprawl i |
| 308.48 | 4.64 | 313.12 | save a lot of energy i keep them at bay |
| 310.80 | 4.00 | 314.80 | without ever having to use macro |
| 313.12 | 4.96 | 318.08 | movements okay |
| 314.80 | 4.16 | 318.96 | so what does that look like if you"ve |
| 318.08 | 3.36 | 321.44 | never done this before |
| 318.96 | 3.76 | 322.72 | go very very slow okay have your partner |
| 321.44 | 4.00 | 325.44 | take a slow shot |
| 322.72 | 3.52 | 326.24 | and then catch your head in the nook of |
| 325.44 | 4.08 | 329.52 | his shoulder |
| 326.24 | 4.80 | 331.04 | and neck right here so we"re gonna get |
| 329.52 | 5.04 | 334.56 | stamped partner takes a slow |
| 331.04 | 3.52 | 334.56 | shot i match it |
| 334.72 | 5.60 | 340.32 | right and he never he never closes the |
| 338.08 | 5.76 | 343.84 | distance he will always be spine length |
| 340.32 | 5.04 | 345.36 | distance away from my legs and hips now |
| 343.84 | 3.04 | 346.88 | what happens if he beats my head |
| 345.36 | 2.88 | 348.24 | position he gets underneath my head and |
| 346.88 | 2.08 | 348.96 | he"s shooting in my hips so we stroll |
| 348.24 | 2.16 | 350.40 | then |
| 348.96 | 3.52 | 352.48 | no we actually have another line of |
| 350.40 | 5.76 | 356.16 | defense that"s your hands |
| 352.48 | 5.52 | 358.00 | defense so partner beats my head |
| 356.16 | 3.76 | 359.92 | because underneath and i"m actually |
| 358.00 | 3.52 | 361.52 | going to down block from here that"s |
| 359.92 | 2.48 | 362.40 | another reason why we keep our elbows in |
| 361.52 | 3.76 | 365.28 | our shot |
| 362.40 | 4.80 | 367.20 | and then i can pull him up down blocking |
| 365.28 | 3.52 | 368.80 | not only stops his shot but allows me to |
| 367.20 | 3.20 | 370.40 | stay in good position so i can |
| 368.80 | 2.16 | 370.96 | immediately shoot one of the best times |
| 370.40 | 2.72 | 373.12 | to shoot |
| 370.96 | 5.04 | 376.00 | is right after your opponent"s shot it"s |
| 373.12 | 2.88 | 376.00 | called a re-shot |
| 376.08 | 3.68 | 379.76 | so alex shoots i keep my hands inside i |
| 378.40 | 3.52 | 381.92 | catch him here i pulled him |
| 379.76 | 4.32 | 384.08 | up that"s one of the best times for me |
| 381.92 | 3.04 | 384.96 | to shoot so if you want to practice down |
| 384.08 | 3.92 | 388.00 | blocking |
| 384.96 | 4.72 | 389.68 | right get a partner and have them shoot |
| 388.00 | 3.44 | 391.44 | a couple double eggs at first maybe a |
| 389.68 | 3.76 | 393.44 | couple single legs if you know them |
| 391.44 | 3.60 | 395.04 | and then practice jutting your hands out |
| 393.44 | 4.24 | 397.68 | this is another reason why |
| 395.04 | 4.48 | 399.52 | um i tend to prefer the oklahoma state |
| 397.68 | 4.08 | 401.76 | style stance with my hands keep my hands |
| 399.52 | 3.92 | 403.44 | my elbows tight to my ribs so i can pop |
| 401.76 | 3.84 | 405.60 | them out i can actually punch |
| 403.44 | 3.68 | 407.12 | i feel like with the iowa style my hands |
| 405.60 | 5.76 | 411.36 | already extended |
| 407.12 | 7.44 | 414.56 | so i can"t create any force outward |
| 411.36 | 6.96 | 418.32 | but here i can so if he goes to shoot |
| 414.56 | 7.04 | 421.60 | i can punch i can meet that pressure |
| 418.32 | 5.04 | 423.36 | with my own pressure okay so practice |
| 421.60 | 2.96 | 424.56 | this a couple times if he"s gonna hit a |
| 423.36 | 4.48 | 427.84 | sweep single |
| 424.56 | 5.76 | 430.32 | all i have to do is punch with one arm |
| 427.84 | 3.84 | 431.68 | for here alex is hitting his sweat right |
| 430.32 | 5.12 | 435.44 | he"s pulling to here i can |
| 431.68 | 6.16 | 437.84 | punch to this side |
| 435.44 | 3.68 | 439.12 | if he"s hitting a high crotch she"s |
| 437.84 | 3.92 | 441.76 | grabbing a collar tie here |
| 439.12 | 3.28 | 442.40 | and then his hands coming inside i down |
| 441.76 | 2.96 | 444.72 | block |
| 442.40 | 3.76 | 446.16 | here and you want to generally think |
| 444.72 | 3.04 | 447.76 | about stepping the leg that they"re |
| 446.16 | 3.12 | 449.28 | attacking away |
| 447.76 | 3.20 | 450.96 | all right they"re tacking both legs on a |
| 449.28 | 3.36 | 452.64 | double leg that may look like this |
| 450.96 | 3.20 | 454.16 | there"s going to be less movement |
| 452.64 | 4.56 | 457.20 | generally here |
| 454.16 | 4.64 | 458.80 | if he"s shooting in right |
| 457.20 | 3.20 | 460.40 | you want to meet pressure or pressure on |
| 458.80 | 4.64 | 463.44 | a double leg if he"s |
| 460.40 | 5.28 | 465.68 | hitting a high crotch i want to |
| 463.44 | 3.68 | 467.12 | create as much distance between him and |
| 465.68 | 3.84 | 469.52 | the leg he"s attacking |
| 467.12 | 3.68 | 470.80 | so as he"s he"s collar tied he"s coming |
| 469.52 | 4.72 | 474.24 | head inside i can |
| 470.80 | 4.64 | 475.44 | step my leg back as i down block okay |
| 474.24 | 3.04 | 477.28 | and then when he goes to hit a sweet |
| 475.44 | 3.12 | 478.56 | single collar tie he"s going to |
| 477.28 | 3.36 | 480.64 | sweep i do the same thing to the other |
| 478.56 | 4.88 | 483.44 | side i step the leg back |
| 480.64 | 4.56 | 485.20 | with my down block thanks alex so when i |
| 483.44 | 2.80 | 486.24 | go to hit this with my stance in motion |
| 485.20 | 3.44 | 488.64 | this is what it looks like |
| 486.24 | 3.12 | 489.36 | now i have to visualize this without a |
| 488.64 | 2.32 | 490.96 | partner |
| 489.36 | 3.68 | 493.04 | i"m in a stance he"s going to hit a |

| 584.72 | 3.12 | 587.84 | cardiovascular workout |
| 586.56 | 3.76 | 590.32 | and not only that instead of just |
| 587.84 | 4.08 | 591.92 | jogging you"re developing your motion |
| 590.32 | 3.04 | 593.36 | you"re developing your action reactions |
| 591.92 | 4.56 | 596.48 | for grappling |
| 593.36 | 5.44 | 598.80 | for an actual skill okay so |
| 596.48 | 4.00 | 600.48 | these are this encompasses the actions |
| 598.80 | 4.16 | 602.96 | and the basic actions |
| 600.48 | 5.04 | 605.52 | and reactions from a rustling |
| 602.96 | 4.48 | 607.44 | perspective from a wrestling stance |
| 605.52 | 3.60 | 609.12 | so like i said previously guys start a |
| 607.44 | 4.56 | 612.00 | timer and try to go for three |
| 609.12 | 3.60 | 612.72 | two minute periods getting as intense as |
| 612.00 | 2.32 | 614.32 | you can |
| 612.72 | 3.44 | 616.16 | in those periods if this is your first |
| 614.32 | 4.64 | 618.96 | time doing actions and reactions from a |
| 616.16 | 4.08 | 620.24 | from a shot be reasonable do the best |
| 618.96 | 3.20 | 622.16 | that you can |
| 620.24 | 3.28 | 623.52 | staying disciplined low in your stance |
| 622.16 | 3.12 | 625.28 | stance position being the |
| 623.52 | 3.28 | 626.80 | being of primary importance and then |
| 625.28 | 2.64 | 627.92 | achieving your actions and reactions |
| 626.80 | 2.72 | 629.52 | from that position |
| 627.92 | 3.36 | 631.28 | track how you"re doing you know if you |
| 629.52 | 3.76 | 633.28 | can only get 30 seconds the first day |
| 631.28 | 3.20 | 634.48 | aim for 40 seconds the second day if you |
| 633.28 | 3.20 | 636.48 | could get two minutes |
| 634.48 | 3.36 | 637.84 | off out the gate and that"s too easy |
| 636.48 | 3.84 | 640.32 | maybe go for three minutes |
| 637.84 | 5.36 | 643.20 | on your on your um on your next go okay |
| 640.32 | 5.28 | 645.60 | so we"re developing intensity and length |
| 643.20 | 3.04 | 646.24 | in our drills over time and that builds |
| 645.60 | 2.24 | 647.84 | strength |
| 646.24 | 13.04 | 659.28 | and conditioning that"s applicable to |
| 647.84 | 11.44 | 659.28 | wrestling and grappling |

## Transcript Text
okay now that you've conditioned your legs and a wrestling stance and you know at least one basic takedown you know what you're aiming for okay so let's talk about actions and reactions from our stance even if you don't have a wide grappling knowledge or a wide array of takedowns in your arsenal yet working on these actions and reactions will develop neural pathways in your brain and develop muscle motion and movement so when you go to learn other takedowns they will come more easily there's real value to doing stance and motion work it's wrestling's equivalent to shadow boxing the basic movements of your actions and reactions from your stance the drop step the sprawl the head position block and the down block with your hands one of the most basic foundational movements in all of wrestling and grappling is your penetration step or your drop step i'm stepping deep closing the distance between my partner and i and then my knee is driving down to the ground my chest stays over my lead leg knee this allows me to cover distance at a very low safe angle getting underneath his head hands defense so he's in a good stance i need to get underneath i need to get low right and my drop step helps me achieve that i step my knee is over my chest is over my knee my elbows are in my knees going to drive down between his legs and then my chest comes up head up hips in back straight you're going to hear that on every single technique video about shooting head up hips and back straight right so how we drill this um how we drill this if you're just doing stance in motion stay down low stance step forward center line down in the stance step forward center line knee goes down over my toe then i repeat the process with my other leg and you get this marching motion where you're just going back and forth start coordinating your arms now with the movement act as if there's someone there's someone in front of you so as my knee drives over my toe and it's about to hit the ground that's about when i would be pulling my hands or pulling his legs in towards my body my head would come up and i can repeat the motion with the other leg and you can get in a nice long field you can get on the carpet inside maybe get some knee pads go slow wear some sweatpants if you're stuck inside and just go slow right you want to get very very comfortable with this drop step it's if you're a bjj guy it's all it's a lot like shrimping it's one of the most foundational movements you're going to find yourself using again and again and again in many different takedowns so if you want to get proficient at your takedowns get better your takedowns just mastering or getting better at this movement the drop step is going to greatly increase your chances and your success rate and your takedowns [Music] now what's the defensive equivalent to our drop step that would be our sprawl so if our partner is using a drop step to shoot at our legs how do we defend that a sprawl right so alex is taking a deep step his knees going over his toes doing a good drop step and he's getting sorry to my legs what i have to do here is sprawl three things have to happen my legs have to go back my hips have to go in and his head has to go down okay i have to get my hands on if we were facing camera here i push on the top of his head my feet go back and my hips go in this one to here my hips go in okay i'm fighting pressure with pressure if i don't push my hips in and he's driving through and my and i simply just push here and try to get my legs back but my hips don't come in he's eventually going to catch up to me okay i have to meet pressure with pressure so as soon as he gets in i hip in legs back head down get in your foot headlock just stuff the shot [Music] [Music] you put your laces on the mat even if you're not wearing shoes you know your laces would be put your laces on the mat right if my toes are on the mat and then i'm putting a post here for him to drive into right i want to slide if he starts driving at all i want to slide and that'll also help position my hips to push in more high level rustlers though know that there's an additional layer of defense actually two layers of additional defense before you actually sprawl it's your head defense and hands defense what you want to think about is keeping your head level just a half inch below his at all times then he has to pass through your line of vision just to get to your leg so what do i mean by that we're in stance facing each other and we're even he can slip underneath me i just keep my eyeline half inch underneath his so when he goes to shoot he passes through my eyeline and i can just meet him with my head right and i don't even have to sprawl i save a lot of energy i keep them at bay without ever having to use macro movements okay so what does that look like if you've never done this before go very very slow okay have your partner take a slow shot and then catch your head in the nook of his shoulder and neck right here so we're gonna get stamped partner takes a slow shot i match it right and he never he never closes the distance he will always be spine length distance away from my legs and hips now what happens if he beats my head position he gets underneath my head and he's shooting in my hips so we stroll then no we actually have another line of defense that's your hands defense so partner beats my head because underneath and i'm actually going to down block from here that's another reason why we keep our elbows in our shot and then i can pull him up down blocking not only stops his shot but allows me to stay in good position so i can immediately shoot one of the best times to shoot is right after your opponent's shot it's called a re-shot so alex shoots i keep my hands inside i catch him here i pulled him up that's one of the best times for me to shoot so if you want to practice down blocking right get a partner and have them shoot a couple double eggs at first maybe a couple single legs if you know them and then practice jutting your hands out this is another reason why um i tend to prefer the oklahoma state style stance with my hands keep my hands my elbows tight to my ribs so i can pop them out i can actually punch i feel like with the iowa style my hands already extended so i can't create any force outward but here i can so if he goes to shoot i can punch i can meet that pressure with my own pressure okay so practice this a couple times if he's gonna hit a sweep single all i have to do is punch with one arm for here alex is hitting his sweat right he's pulling to here i can punch to this side if he's hitting a high crotch she's grabbing a collar tie here and then his hands coming inside i down block here and you want to generally think about stepping the leg that they're attacking away all right they're tacking both legs on a double leg that may look like this there's going to be less movement generally here if he's shooting in right you want to meet pressure or pressure on a double leg if he's hitting a high crotch i want to create as much distance between him and the leg he's attacking so as he's he's collar tied he's coming head inside i can step my leg back as i down block okay and then when he goes to hit a sweet single collar tie he's going to sweep i do the same thing to the other side i step the leg back with my down block thanks alex so when i go to hit this with my stance in motion this is what it looks like now i have to visualize this without a partner i'm in a stance he's going to hit a double leg i can down block down block i envision my partner is going to hit a sweep i down block pivoting on my lead leg if he's hitting that high crotch the head outside single on my lead leg i'm going to cross cross and my trail leg becomes the pivot leg he's attacking lead leg down block pivot block pivot down block pivot now let's tie them all together set a timer for about two maybe three minutes depending on where your conditioning is at and in your head start rotating through all of your actions and reactions in your stance i envision my partner gets past my head hands defense i have to straw come on i reach [Music] shoot down one down lock strong [Music] shoot [Music] sprawl again and again and again see how active you can get in that two or three minute period timer goes off stop catch your breath repeat it two to three times just do this for six to ten minutes right it's gonna be plenty of a cardiovascular workout and not only that instead of just jogging you're developing your motion you're developing your action reactions for grappling for an actual skill okay so these are this encompasses the actions and the basic actions and reactions from a rustling perspective from a wrestling stance so like i said previously guys start a timer and try to go for three two minute periods getting as intense as you can in those periods if this is your first time doing actions and reactions from a from a shot be reasonable do the best that you can staying disciplined low in your stance stance position being the being of primary importance and then achieving your actions and reactions from that position track how you're doing you know if you can only get 30 seconds the first day aim for 40 seconds the second day if you could get two minutes off out the gate and that's too easy maybe go for three minutes on your on your um on your next go okay so we're developing intensity and length in our drills over time and that builds strength and conditioning that's applicable to wrestling and grappling
