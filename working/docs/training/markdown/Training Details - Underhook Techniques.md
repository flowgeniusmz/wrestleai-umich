| 0.16 | 2.96 | 3.12 | look if you want to get as good as you |
| 1.28 | 3.36 | 4.64 | can as fast as you can in grappling it"d |
| 3.12 | 2.96 | 6.08 | be a good idea to spend the majority of |
| 4.64 | 2.72 | 7.36 | your training in the most common |
| 6.08 | 2.40 | 8.48 | positions that you"re going to be ending |
| 7.36 | 3.36 | 10.72 | up in |
| 8.48 | 4.64 | 13.12 | in every single wrestling match every |
| 10.72 | 4.24 | 14.96 | bjj match and every single fight nearly |
| 13.12 | 3.28 | 16.40 | every single one of these categories you |
| 14.96 | 3.20 | 18.16 | end up in what"s called |
| 16.40 | 3.28 | 19.68 | the over under position where your chest |
| 18.16 | 3.12 | 21.28 | to chest you have an underhook and an |
| 19.68 | 4.24 | 23.92 | overhook and your partner has the same |
| 21.28 | 4.00 | 25.28 | it"s a 50 50 position where both people |
| 23.92 | 2.72 | 26.64 | have equal opportunity |
| 25.28 | 3.44 | 28.72 | we"re going to be learning offense from |
| 26.64 | 3.84 | 30.48 | here down the road but in order to make |
| 28.72 | 2.64 | 31.36 | our offense effective we first have to |
| 30.48 | 3.20 | 33.68 | have effective |
| 31.36 | 4.00 | 35.36 | motion in this position and there are a |
| 33.68 | 4.48 | 38.16 | couple drills you can develop and use |
| 35.36 | 4.48 | 39.84 | right now to really develop that motion |
| 38.16 | 3.04 | 41.20 | at some point during the match you"re |
| 39.84 | 2.32 | 42.16 | gonna have to close the distance between |
| 41.20 | 3.36 | 44.56 | you and your partner |
| 42.16 | 4.00 | 46.16 | and when that happens a great portion of |
| 44.56 | 3.04 | 47.60 | the time you"ll end up in this over on |
| 46.16 | 2.72 | 48.88 | your position let"s say i take a shot |
| 47.60 | 3.44 | 51.04 | alex has a good reaction |
| 48.88 | 4.48 | 53.36 | and he catches me on one end and we end |
| 51.04 | 4.72 | 55.76 | up in this over under position |
| 53.36 | 3.60 | 56.96 | i have an underhook he has an underhook |
| 55.76 | 3.84 | 59.60 | i have an overhook |
| 56.96 | 4.08 | 61.04 | he has an overhook it"s a 50 50 position |
| 59.60 | 3.76 | 63.36 | how do we advance from here |
| 61.04 | 4.00 | 65.04 | okay i need to be able to create motion |
| 63.36 | 2.88 | 66.24 | if i push it into alex |
| 65.04 | 2.96 | 68.00 | he"s more than likely going to start |
| 66.24 | 3.84 | 70.08 | pushing back and when that happens i"m |
| 68.00 | 5.12 | 73.12 | going to clamp down |
| 70.08 | 6.80 | 76.88 | on my underhook and pull |
| 73.12 | 7.60 | 80.72 | and circle see that big step that i get |
| 76.88 | 6.88 | 83.76 | i get him in motion clockwise i get him |
| 80.72 | 4.72 | 85.44 | in motion this way we can repeat that |
| 83.76 | 4.56 | 88.32 | motion alex can push it to me |
| 85.44 | 3.76 | 89.20 | i go to push back these circle pulls i |
| 88.32 | 3.76 | 92.08 | push into him |
| 89.20 | 4.64 | 93.84 | he pushes back i circle pull get |
| 92.08 | 3.20 | 95.28 | comfortable here creating motion the |
| 93.84 | 3.84 | 97.68 | reason i do this |
| 95.28 | 4.24 | 99.52 | is because while he"s turning in motion |
| 97.68 | 3.76 | 101.44 | while he"s moving in motion |
| 99.52 | 4.24 | 103.76 | his underhook is going to loosen up ever |
| 101.44 | 3.28 | 104.72 | so slightly allowing my overhook to swan |
| 103.76 | 4.96 | 108.72 | dive |
| 104.72 | 8.56 | 113.28 | underneath dig high to double underhooks |
| 108.72 | 7.28 | 116.00 | here okay so if i don"t create motion |
| 113.28 | 4.08 | 117.36 | and i simply just dig for an underhook |
| 116.00 | 2.64 | 118.64 | i"m trying to get the double unders if i |
| 117.36 | 2.32 | 119.68 | just dig he"s just going to do the same |
| 118.64 | 2.80 | 121.44 | thing on this side |
| 119.68 | 3.04 | 122.72 | and we"re going to end up in this |
| 121.44 | 3.60 | 125.04 | endless |
| 122.72 | 3.28 | 126.00 | pummel where we"re both just expending |
| 125.04 | 2.56 | 127.60 | energy |
| 126.00 | 4.16 | 130.16 | staying in essentially the exact same |
| 127.60 | 5.68 | 133.28 | position just changing sides so |
| 130.16 | 4.88 | 135.04 | what i do is i disguise with motion i |
| 133.28 | 3.20 | 136.48 | disguise my offense with motion |
| 135.04 | 3.68 | 138.72 | and that also creates a nice little |
| 136.48 | 3.12 | 139.60 | opening here circle pull swan dive |
| 138.72 | 2.64 | 141.36 | underneath |
| 139.60 | 3.28 | 142.88 | hands go to gable grip elbows high my |
| 141.36 | 2.40 | 143.76 | elbows are not low because he can lock |
| 142.88 | 3.20 | 146.08 | his hands between us |
| 143.76 | 3.68 | 147.44 | that"s going to nullify my underhooks |
| 146.08 | 4.64 | 150.72 | okay i want my |
| 147.44 | 3.84 | 151.28 | underhooks high once i"m here i"m going |
| 150.72 | 2.24 | 152.96 | to step |
| 151.28 | 3.04 | 154.32 | head side my head"s on this side so i"m |
| 152.96 | 3.20 | 156.16 | going to step head side getting |
| 154.32 | 4.00 | 158.32 | perpendicular to his hips |
| 156.16 | 4.32 | 160.48 | once i"m perpendicular i"m going to roll |
| 158.32 | 4.48 | 162.80 | my shoulders and flare my elbow |
| 160.48 | 4.00 | 164.48 | the over hook side my head side i"m |
| 162.80 | 9.04 | 171.84 | going to roll my shoulders |
| 164.48 | 7.36 | 171.84 | and flare my elbow take it back |
| 176.32 | 3.36 | 179.68 | really flare that elbow okay it"s |
| 178.32 | 4.16 | 182.48 | another reason why |
| 179.68 | 4.00 | 183.68 | you want your elbows to be high here you |
| 182.48 | 3.76 | 186.24 | want you want it |
| 183.68 | 3.36 | 187.04 | nice and set up to be flared over top if |
| 186.24 | 2.32 | 188.56 | i"m low |
| 187.04 | 3.12 | 190.16 | that"s a great distance for him to cover |
| 188.56 | 3.28 | 191.84 | and also the closer your elbows are to |
| 190.16 | 3.60 | 193.76 | your body the stronger you"re gonna get |
| 191.84 | 3.68 | 195.52 | okay so his elbows are close to his body |
| 193.76 | 3.36 | 197.12 | here so it"s gonna be hard to flare that |
| 195.52 | 2.88 | 198.40 | elbow i want him high with his elbows |
| 197.12 | 3.28 | 200.40 | away from his body |
| 198.40 | 4.88 | 203.28 | then when i go a step with much better |
| 200.40 | 5.60 | 206.00 | likelihood of getting |
| 203.28 | 2.72 | 206.00 | to his back |
| 208.56 | 5.92 | 214.48 | pushing in pushing in circle pull |
| 211.60 | 3.60 | 215.20 | swan dive underneath elbows high step |
| 214.48 | 3.28 | 217.76 | head side |
| 215.20 | 3.60 | 218.80 | and watch my shoulders i"m going to roll |
| 217.76 | 3.52 | 221.28 | my shoulders |
| 218.80 | 4.24 | 223.04 | and it"s like a whip i roll my shoulders |
| 221.28 | 3.84 | 225.12 | and then all that momentum flares out to |
| 223.04 | 5.28 | 228.32 | my elbow |
| 225.12 | 5.04 | 230.16 | which flips him over top okay |
| 228.32 | 3.04 | 231.36 | okay guys so what do i do once i get to |
| 230.16 | 3.12 | 233.28 | the back okay |
| 231.36 | 3.36 | 234.72 | once i"m on the back it"s not enough |
| 233.28 | 2.80 | 236.08 | just to stand there we have to get him |
| 234.72 | 2.72 | 237.44 | to the ground right |
| 236.08 | 2.88 | 238.96 | all i"m going to do is a very very |
| 237.44 | 3.52 | 240.96 | simple finish from here there"s a lot of |
| 238.96 | 5.12 | 244.08 | finishes i"m gonna show you one that"s |
| 240.96 | 4.24 | 245.20 | not uh very explosive so it"s not gonna |
| 244.08 | 2.48 | 246.56 | cost you a lot of energy |
| 245.20 | 5.12 | 250.32 | and it"s gonna then you"re gonna end up |
| 246.56 | 3.76 | 250.32 | in a very advantageous position okay |
| 251.28 | 7.68 | 258.96 | all i"m gonna do is step |
| 255.84 | 4.48 | 260.32 | on his far foot okay i"m gonna step on |
| 258.96 | 2.16 | 261.12 | his ankle doesn"t matter what side you |
| 260.32 | 3.28 | 263.60 | do it to |
| 261.12 | 3.84 | 264.96 | and i"m gonna sag my hips low and pull |
| 263.60 | 6.24 | 269.84 | him into me |
| 264.96 | 4.88 | 269.84 | slap my hips low |
| 275.52 | 4.00 | 279.52 | see there"s a little reverberating |
| 276.96 | 3.84 | 280.80 | motion where i separate my hips from his |
| 279.52 | 4.56 | 284.08 | for a moment |
| 280.80 | 7.52 | 288.32 | so i have some space to yank him back |
| 284.08 | 6.48 | 290.56 | into me back there we go |
| 288.32 | 3.12 | 291.44 | here i don"t just stay here and try to |
| 290.56 | 2.72 | 293.28 | fall okay |
| 291.44 | 3.44 | 294.88 | i need to have some motion i need to |
| 293.28 | 2.16 | 295.44 | yank him back into me like a ball and |
| 294.88 | 3.68 | 298.56 | chain |
| 295.44 | 6.72 | 302.16 | i sag my hips and then yank |
| 298.56 | 6.88 | 305.44 | my grip and turn |
| 302.16 | 5.20 | 307.36 | cover very common reaction when you go |
| 305.44 | 5.20 | 310.64 | to take the back |
| 307.36 | 5.52 | 312.88 | when you go to take the back |
| 310.64 | 4.32 | 314.96 | his overhook side that you"re trying to |
| 312.88 | 4.08 | 316.96 | whip over is going to clamp down |
| 314.96 | 4.16 | 319.12 | so i step get my hips perpendicular i go |
| 316.96 | 4.16 | 321.12 | to throw and he clamps down |
| 319.12 | 3.04 | 322.16 | on that overhook and i can"t flare it |
| 321.12 | 3.36 | 324.48 | over top now |
| 322.16 | 3.12 | 325.28 | can"t get it we"re gonna use the exact |
| 324.48 | 2.56 | 327.04 | same finish |
| 325.28 | 3.12 | 328.40 | all right as long as my hips have a |
| 327.04 | 2.80 | 329.84 | little bit of an angle here as long as |
| 328.40 | 2.16 | 330.56 | i"m not facing him i have a little bit |
| 329.84 | 2.96 | 332.80 | of an angle |
| 330.56 | 4.08 | 334.64 | i"m gonna do the exact same finish step |
| 332.80 | 5.68 | 338.48 | with my same foot |
| 334.64 | 6.56 | 341.20 | sag my hips and pull him |
| 338.48 | 2.72 | 341.20 | down into me |
| 341.76 | 3.52 | 345.28 | and there is a little bit of a twisting |
| 343.28 | 6.32 | 349.60 | motion you want to fall |
| 345.28 | 4.32 | 349.60 | to the hip of the leg that"s posting |
| 350.48 | 4.40 | 354.88 | my left foot"s posting so my left hip"s |
| 353.68 | 2.96 | 356.64 | going to land |
| 354.88 | 2.88 | 357.76 | i said it"s really important to sag your |
| 356.64 | 2.16 | 358.80 | hips here guys because he has an |
| 357.76 | 3.36 | 361.12 | opportunity to throw |
| 358.80 | 3.68 | 362.48 | from his overhook so you have to sag |
| 361.12 | 2.88 | 364.00 | your hips so he"s going to send you |
| 362.48 | 3.60 | 366.08 | he"s going to give you some frequent |
| 364.00 | 3.68 | 367.68 | flyer models sitting for a ride so i |
| 366.08 | 4.40 | 370.48 | pull my grip in tight |
| 367.68 | 3.76 | 371.44 | step sag my hips my hips are sagged he"s |
| 370.48 | 4.80 | 375.28 | not going to throw him |
| 371.44 | 6.40 | 377.84 | okay sag pull |
| 375.28 | 4.00 | 379.28 | turn and cover just so you know what |
| 377.84 | 4.16 | 382.00 | you"re avoiding |
| 379.28 | 5.20 | 384.48 | in this position if alex has double |
| 382.00 | 5.28 | 387.28 | overs for double unders rather and he |
| 384.48 | 4.72 | 389.20 | gets perpendicular he steps here i have |
| 387.28 | 3.44 | 390.72 | an opportunity or a few steps |
| 389.20 | 3.84 | 393.04 | around to go to trip i have an |
| 390.72 | 5.44 | 396.16 | opportunity to throw i can hook this leg |
| 393.04 | 5.76 | 398.80 | and throw over top i can step deep |
| 396.16 | 4.08 | 400.24 | um judo guys know too well all too well |
| 398.80 | 2.00 | 400.80 | so there"s a lot of throwing opportunity |
| 400.24 | 3.52 | 403.76 | here |
| 400.80 | 6.04 | 406.84 | hike this up see how his hips are close |
| 403.76 | 7.76 | 411.52 | i can throw from here step |
| 406.84 | 8.20 | 415.04 | throw now i can"t do that |
| 411.52 | 6.16 | 417.68 | alex"s grip is low on my hip |
| 415.04 | 4.08 | 419.12 | and his hips are low his hips are locked |
| 417.68 | 3.68 | 421.36 | it"s way harder to throw him |
| 419.12 | 3.20 | 422.32 | so if he steps his foot behind my foot |
| 421.36 | 2.40 | 423.76 | here |
| 422.32 | 2.80 | 425.12 | and goes to stack his hips it"s way |
| 423.76 | 3.36 | 427.12 | harder to throw him i have to get my |
| 425.12 | 2.72 | 427.84 | hips under his hips to throw effectively |
| 427.12 | 2.40 | 429.52 | from here |
| 427.84 | 4.24 | 432.08 | okay so just make sure you keep your |
| 429.52 | 2.56 | 432.08 | hips low |
| 433.20 | 4.16 | 437.36 | keep your hips low i have you overlooked |
| 435.92 | 4.88 | 440.80 | keep your hips low |
| 437.36 | 6.64 | 444.00 | post your foot right behind his heel sag |
| 440.80 | 3.20 | 444.00 | and yank him back into you |
| 445.36 | 6.48 | 451.84 | turn the car |
| 462.84 | 3.00 | 465.84 | huh |
| 481.28 | 3.92 | 485.20 | like i previously stated guys this is |
| 483.28 | 3.76 | 487.04 | one of the most common positions you"re |
| 485.20 | 4.88 | 490.08 | going to end up in grappling |
| 487.04 | 5.36 | 492.40 | but oddly enough we spend some of |
| 490.08 | 3.68 | 493.76 | the least amount of time in our training |
| 492.40 | 4.24 | 496.64 | in this position |
| 493.76 | 3.92 | 497.68 | our emphasis is always on shooting or |
| 496.64 | 4.24 | 500.88 | throws |
| 497.68 | 5.28 | 502.96 | or uh fancy movements but |
| 500.88 | 3.28 | 504.16 | this simple over under position is |
| 502.96 | 3.20 | 506.16 | almost guaranteed |
| 504.16 | 3.12 | 507.28 | whenever you take a shot if your partner |
| 506.16 | 2.40 | 508.56 | stuffs the shot |
| 507.28 | 3.52 | 510.80 | you"re going to end up here half the |
| 508.56 | 3.76 | 512.32 | time or or just from closing the |
| 510.80 | 2.88 | 513.68 | distance in any manner you"re going to |
| 512.32 | 3.92 | 516.24 | end up chest to chest |
| 513.68 | 3.28 | 516.96 | okay so dedicating a large portion of |
| 516.24 | 2.56 | 518.80 | your training |
| 516.96 | 3.28 | 520.24 | just to this singular position will |
| 518.80 | 15.76 | 534.56 | greatly increase your chances |
| 520.24 | 16.40 | 536.64 | of being successful in your takedowns |
| 534.56 | 2.08 | 536.64 | you |

look if you want to get as good as you can as fast as you can in grappling it'd be a good idea to spend the majority of your training in the most common positions that you're going to be ending up in in every single wrestling match every bjj match and every single fight nearly every single one of these categories you end up in what's called the over under position where your chest to chest you have an underhook and an overhook and your partner has the same it's a 50 50 position where both people have equal opportunity we're going to be learning offense from here down the road but in order to make our offense effective we first have to have effective motion in this position and there are a couple drills you can develop and use right now to really develop that motion at some point during the match you're gonna have to close the distance between you and your partner and when that happens a great portion of the time you'll end up in this over on your position let's say i take a shot alex has a good reaction and he catches me on one end and we end up in this over under position i have an underhook he has an underhook i have an overhook he has an overhook it's a 50 50 position how do we advance from here okay i need to be able to create motion if i push it into alex he's more than likely going to start pushing back and when that happens i'm going to clamp down on my underhook and pull and circle see that big step that i get i get him in motion clockwise i get him in motion this way we can repeat that motion alex can push it to me i go to push back these circle pulls i push into him he pushes back i circle pull get comfortable here creating motion the reason i do this is because while he's turning in motion while he's moving in motion his underhook is going to loosen up ever so slightly allowing my overhook to swan dive underneath dig high to double underhooks here okay so if i don't create motion and i simply just dig for an underhook i'm trying to get the double unders if i just dig he's just going to do the same thing on this side and we're going to end up in this endless pummel where we're both just expending energy staying in essentially the exact same position just changing sides so what i do is i disguise with motion i disguise my offense with motion and that also creates a nice little opening here circle pull swan dive underneath hands go to gable grip elbows high my elbows are not low because he can lock his hands between us that's going to nullify my underhooks okay i want my underhooks high once i'm here i'm going to step head side my head's on this side so i'm going to step head side getting perpendicular to his hips once i'm perpendicular i'm going to roll my shoulders and flare my elbow the over hook side my head side i'm going to roll my shoulders and flare my elbow take it back really flare that elbow okay it's another reason why you want your elbows to be high here you want you want it nice and set up to be flared over top if i'm low that's a great distance for him to cover and also the closer your elbows are to your body the stronger you're gonna get okay so his elbows are close to his body here so it's gonna be hard to flare that elbow i want him high with his elbows away from his body then when i go a step with much better likelihood of getting to his back pushing in pushing in circle pull swan dive underneath elbows high step head side and watch my shoulders i'm going to roll my shoulders and it's like a whip i roll my shoulders and then all that momentum flares out to my elbow which flips him over top okay okay guys so what do i do once i get to the back okay once i'm on the back it's not enough just to stand there we have to get him to the ground right all i'm going to do is a very very simple finish from here there's a lot of finishes i'm gonna show you one that's not uh very explosive so it's not gonna cost you a lot of energy and it's gonna then you're gonna end up in a very advantageous position okay all i'm gonna do is step on his far foot okay i'm gonna step on his ankle doesn't matter what side you do it to and i'm gonna sag my hips low and pull him into me slap my hips low see there's a little reverberating motion where i separate my hips from his for a moment so i have some space to yank him back into me back there we go here i don't just stay here and try to fall okay i need to have some motion i need to yank him back into me like a ball and chain i sag my hips and then yank my grip and turn cover very common reaction when you go to take the back when you go to take the back his overhook side that you're trying to whip over is going to clamp down so i step get my hips perpendicular i go to throw and he clamps down on that overhook and i can't flare it over top now can't get it we're gonna use the exact same finish all right as long as my hips have a little bit of an angle here as long as i'm not facing him i have a little bit of an angle i'm gonna do the exact same finish step with my same foot sag my hips and pull him down into me and there is a little bit of a twisting motion you want to fall to the hip of the leg that's posting my left foot's posting so my left hip's going to land i said it's really important to sag your hips here guys because he has an opportunity to throw from his overhook so you have to sag your hips so he's going to send you he's going to give you some frequent flyer models sitting for a ride so i pull my grip in tight step sag my hips my hips are sagged he's not going to throw him okay sag pull turn and cover just so you know what you're avoiding in this position if alex has double overs for double unders rather and he gets perpendicular he steps here i have an opportunity or a few steps around to go to trip i have an opportunity to throw i can hook this leg and throw over top i can step deep um judo guys know too well all too well so there's a lot of throwing opportunity here hike this up see how his hips are close i can throw from here step throw now i can't do that alex's grip is low on my hip and his hips are low his hips are locked it's way harder to throw him so if he steps his foot behind my foot here and goes to stack his hips it's way harder to throw him i have to get my hips under his hips to throw effectively from here okay so just make sure you keep your hips low keep your hips low i have you overlooked keep your hips low post your foot right behind his heel sag and yank him back into you turn the car huh like i previously stated guys this is one of the most common positions you're going to end up in grappling but oddly enough we spend some of the least amount of time in our training in this position our emphasis is always on shooting or throws or uh fancy movements but this simple over under position is almost guaranteed whenever you take a shot if your partner stuffs the shot you're going to end up here half the time or or just from closing the distance in any manner you're going to end up chest to chest okay so dedicating a large portion of your training just to this singular position will greatly increase your chances of being successful in your takedowns you
