I feel so grateful huh you know I think when you're younger you just think you do it on your own right I'm good I'm gonna be the best um as I've gotten older it's farther from that honestly it's uh just my team around me and I'm just so grateful for them like I just wouldn't be here um my wife my main support system my girls I mean my my daughter to start playing soccer shots and she gave me a medal she's got it first day she gotta give it to me she's like Daddy Why don't you like this every day and I want to be a champion you know it's like Priceless moments and my daughter youngest one just turned two yesterday and she's watching She's cheering me on and they have no idea the magnitude of what this is but I miss them so much but I'm also doing it for them you know I wanna be proud of their dad for having some heart and some grit something that you know Society we don't get a chance to do that very often and I'm lucky I get a chance to do that once a year every year the biggest stage so and Coach Casey I mean unbelievable you know when I first got to Penn State piece of advice to the u.so keeps coming in baby national champion out there on the Olympics you know I said listen One Step higher the rest of the case Climb Every Day winning Olympics and uh still to this day I mean he's like my rock I just it was a tough tough you know training and he pulled me through big time you know he just kind of helped me get refocused emotionally and physically and you guys only see this part of it but you don't get a chance to see the other part of it you know and uh it feels really good adjustment [Music] so yesterday honestly it's just like it's just in a matching it's freaking hard in here it's like I gotta find a way and it's changed so much when I first started wrestling it was a firefight you know he that's what he does that says in the natural instinct is a firefight and that's what our early matches were and as time's going on it's become more calculated and you know we got the better of me and I really had to make some adjustments I remember thinking after Oslo you know man has he passed me you know did I get lucky in the Olympics so last year was a big motivating factor and then this year is just knowing the light in the tunnel right I mean for one year for the Olympics and that's where I'm at the beach to fulfill that so it's just finding a way every time and so good his coach is really having so well prepared I mean he I can just tell the addresses he's making I'm like I want to fly like all right Frick I kind of feel like this is what I thought he was going to do and now I gotta make some changes because this is going to be tough so I mean long-winded answer for this is wrestling he's really good and I just got to find a way every time it's amazing I mean you just don't get that we don't we got that at Penn State you know it's like a unique place in the whole world and then Bill replicate something like that on the world scene you know like you got people from all over the world traveling to be here to see this in person you know and like I said I'm just grateful be a part of this I'm grateful for him pushing me because if it wasn't for yazani I wouldn't really have a lot of motivation to keep you in better you know um so he's he's pushing me every day so I'm thankful for him thing that says about the ability of sports a great nations of people together yeah wrestling's unique it's a Common Language we know the score We Know What It Takes anyone that's wrestled knows what it's like to be a wrestler and it's freaking hard so something we all share and uh you know I think my wrestling brings people together because I go out and I try and score a lot of points you know now I've I've had a Tech fall or pin in every single major competition my entire life state tournament NCAA tournament World Championship Olympic Games is next you know so um I just want to keep trying score points you know that's what I'll hopefully be rememberable by is that Fearless competitor yeah definitely I mean huh I mean 32 you know I got a couple adult beverages um I deserve them you know it's been hard but we got some friends and family here I'm looking forward to spending with them and get ready first so tomorrow rest some more wrestling tomorrow our team is doing great right in the mix we're gonna have to perform well tomorrow and be here bright and early turn those guys on I'll tell you what's no there isn't a better feeling than waking up tomorrow morning World gold medal coming in shooting your team on just like relaxing next couple of days enjoying it you know it's pretty great [Music] yeah I know it's funny I I've been fortunate that I haven't been in me it's a that's the first significant challenge I think I've ever been a part of and it was stressful you know it was my move I definitely initiate it he you know if I don't finish on top we finish neutral I think it's him you know I just kept wrestling on top and just you just kind of got to pray that when they get a chance to look at it they look at your way and I definitely initiated it now they always tell you you know you just head on the other side of your feet finish on top and I did the best that I could finish on top and that's a massive momentum swinger I mean massive I mean if I'm losing there after that that's a that's a tough thing I mean I would have done it but it would have been hard it's much better to have that lead and be a local counter offense that would extend it like I did look at that time it's one Tournament of time you know Obama competitor I'm competitive you know I want to be the best at what I do and I just think the fact that I've had to go through that guy every single time I've stepped out there says speaks volumes because without me that guy's winning every single one of these for forever talking about 10 time gold medalists um so I mean I hope that is part of that but listen chips fall and they're done you can remember me for whatever you want to remember me for it but since I mean I I'm the most dynamic dominant wrestler the sports I've ever seen I truly believe that and uh say whatever you want to do about championships um I'm out there scoring the most amount of points I possibly can at every single level that's something I want to be remembered by thanks guys that's enough thanks guys
