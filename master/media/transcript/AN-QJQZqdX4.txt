2016 at 74 kilograms since then he's been at 86 kilograms so golden 17 a bronze in 18. a golden 19. a silver at the Olympics in 2020 a golden 21 and a silver and 22 highly decorated David Taylor made the team in 2018 where he was a gold medalist in at 86 a golden Olympics in 2020 a silver and 21 to yazdani chirati and a golden 22. three-time world and Olympic champion in an interview with United World Wrestling David Taylor said this is what the people want to see they want to see yazdani chirati and Taylor going at it [Music] these two have had dramatic matches throughout their careers [Music] Dynamic scorers [Music] They Know Each Other Well and I'm sure a steady film of every step and every breath and every movement they know what each other's do what each other is going to do during the bout [Music] [Applause] that's a red [Applause] [Music] no score just yet just over a minute gone here in Period number one back to the hand fighting head position [Applause] yazdani with his patented left-handed underhook Taylor able to slip and face not give up the angle [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hand pulls by Taylor with that left hand side really protecting with his right arm to not give up the underhook pull and swing single by Taylor yazdani chirati squares up and a second passivity call against David Taylor he goes on the 30-second activity period and a lot of the matches tonight we've seen the first round kind of start off a little slow start off with each athlete testing the other one out but not here like you mentioned this is their sixth time meeting and they are not letting any moment waste by they are going after each other from the first whistle we are seeing level changes we are seeing attacks we are seeing motions side to side we are seeing incredible wrestling so that's one first point on the board for yazdari chirati he takes the lead one to zero a head pull by Taylor straight attack multiple attacks by both athletes and Taylor in to get deep on the legs yazdani chirani with a chest wrap in a four-point throw confirmed 4-4 one point on the reversal for Taylor so five to one yazdani chirati and a challenge requested by the United States the fans are going absolutely wild in the stands as we see that action by hasanya high on the counter-attack on David Taylor's offense we have a challenge so we are going to go to the big screen to see that action so he has done it yes Donnie does take Taylor through on the chest round the coaches are looking at the stage looking at the screen watching intently is what we see and here's the action of that so Taylor's in on the legs but did hazami initiate that action to get that exposure for the four-point takedown that's the decision that the jury is wanting to decide it's out of The Athlete's hands at this point and we go to a third party jury to make that decision here's the action that we're looking at right now Taylor's hands unlocked that's Donnie chirati did he change the direction of Taylor to get that four point hold ER look at this from several angles to see was the Direction Changed knee pound by Taylor he's tapping his chest saying that's my move yes Donnie girati saying uh-uh that's my move and again we see the input of Technology on so many different angles of this motion and every different angle tells a different story of who had control that moment whose hand were locked in a moment here's the jury making the decision [Applause] oh um [Applause] [Music] so the call was David Taylor with a four point feet to back exposure Yaz Dani chirati takes him through for two points and then a one point reversal for Taylor so the good challenge by the United States as they take the lead six to three you hear the whistles in the stands next to five all right three to five because the four point take them in the one point reversal with design was winning one nothing correct and the accolades are standing apart not willing to initiate until the right scores on the board which is the smart move and here's that action again that we're gonna see one more time so the knee pound by Taylor he walks it up takes yazdani to his back for four he gets rolled through for two by yazdani and then one point on the reversal for Taylor [Applause] so five to three and back to action it wouldn't be a yes Donnie Taylor match without drama and we have it here in Serbia the 2023 World Championships both of these athletes have already claimed their prize to go to the Olympic Games for their country and now they just want to be at the top of the podium once again and you see yazani have a little smirk he thought that action was slightly different you can still it's almost gonna maybe he's gonna keep him up tonight but there's three minutes left of action so he needs to regroup refocus stick to his game plan and put points back on the board and what we know about these two the first period hasn't mattered in many of their matches it comes down to that last three minute Sprint and both of these athletes have the the the the wind and the guts to go they could go 15 minutes of a fight coach should come back out and here we go three minutes to go for the 86 kilogram World Championship [Music] one of these athletes has owned the top of the podium since 2017 as a world and Olympic champion they met each other first round of the 2018 World Championships back to action and so with that four point taken by Taylor yazdani needs to not just tie to win on criteria but he needs to score one additional point that's got to play into his strategy when I think about what he needs to do to tailor here to stay on top of the podium Taylor stays grounded there yazdani is well known for those tough Chef chest rap and those go behinds Taylor able to hold his body and not allow yazdani to go behind back to action hard Left Hand underhook by yazdani chirati now pulls the angle creates the angle and they get to their feet squared up there's been a couple times in this match but he has done a go fake left to go right to go behind it every single time David Taylor's done a great job squaring up and keeping him in front of him Taylor pulling on the head yazdani digging the underhook angle by Taylor he has Donnie squares up great action here in Serbia at 86 kilograms back to the Head pull straight double Low by Taylor swings his hips hard to the left Yaz Dani chirati with a chest wrap Taylor looking to expose the back of [Applause] hip hop and a head roll two points on the takedown for David Taylor he takes a 7-3 lead just over a minute to go in this 86 kilogram final [Applause] back to action the Iranian horns going off trying to will their hero yazdani chirati to a victory here with 55-0 seconds to go Relentless hand fighting here from yazdani to level change to look for those attacks but David Taylor is staying low he's staying composed the long arms of David Taylor not allowing yazdani to get to the corner to score using tactical wrestling on the edge of the mat not allowing a step out staying grounded yazdani tratty looking to change angles to go behind and here we go on the edge of the match swing single on the left hand side a chest wrap by us Danny charity Taylor puts him in danger yazdani on his back Taylor looking for the fall [Applause] he's not out of that yet the head is still inbounds and so that means they're going to continue to going the referee puts his hand down to confirmed by David Taylor oh no again a world champion David Taylor now a three-time world champion four-time world and Olympic champion and goes to the center [Applause] [Music] so once again Another War not without drama action for six straight minutes looking to pull him to his back but he falls on his own back and Taylor holds him there for the fall and the world title [Music] relief Joy just surrealness he's going back to Paris it's raining Olympic champion and he's got unfinished business yet it sounds like absolutely and you look at
