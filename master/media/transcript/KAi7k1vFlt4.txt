gold medalist three time world champion overall is 33-year-old David Taylor including the last two in a row but after losing in round one to Brooks 41 Aaron Brooks with a stellar second period takedown Jim David Taylor is up against it he's got to win this Fout and another one to have a shot to defend his Olympic goal two in a row against Aaron Brooks is a really very very difficult task this is the match this crowd has been waiting for Aaron Brooks David Taylor Unstoppable Force meets the immovable object again 10 years separation and Taylor used to wow the crowds here in State College at the college level and he's done that internationally for everybody looking around the globe and American fans in particular and now Brooks bursting on the scene he's gotten it done at the H group level as well two time H group World Champ including the U23 level last year won the 2023 national title as well got him the best of three final series trip against David Taylor but Taylor swept those two bouts 6 nothing 54 but Brooks turning the tide and now Taylor coming out super aggressive with way more popping energy Jin than b number one yeah that was his first match of the tournament came out a little bit flat not so tonight David Taylor says that he wants to wrestle a pace that nobody can keep up with but we all know that Aaron Brooks is a Relentless competitor nobody's yet been able to force him to uh to wilt in a match and like we saw with Kyle D and Jason off earlier at 74 kg here at V6 kg 189 lb you got two guys from the same wrestling club same training room so no secrets here if you're David Taylor how do you go about maybe changing things up against the guy who probably seen most and not all of your Arsenal no surprises just have to do what you do it better than your your opponent cuz they both know what's coming Aaron Brooks fresh off an NCA Championship a few weeks ago David Taylor hasn't wrestled as many matches this year so there's some skill of thought that Heron Brooks is is on a roll and may be able to continue it through here and we've seen hot wrestlers transition from NCA success one year into the Olympics you think of Jordan Burrows doing that in route to gold in London Jaden Cox did it after winning an NCA title in Missouri then came through the challenge tournament won an Olympic trip and Olympic bronze in Rio see the early blood time here in this period and you look at the history David Taylor among those who would have an opportunity to join this esteemed list of American wrestlers who have won multiple Olympic goals Helen marus Kyle sler already qualified looking to join that list but David Taylor could be another one who has that opportunity certainly would put your name in the pantheon of American wrestling you already get that when you win Olympic gold but if you double it up quite a leite company back at it here under two minutes left to go opening period we see who not notches Score first Taylor doing a great job of getting on the head and setting some shots but Aaron Brooks with his under books he is Relentless with those things Aon Brooks really good on his feet so far this match he looks really fresh good motion good movement good reactions native of hagertown Maryland Aaron Brooks more more blood time the mat calls him over for a little consultation not sure what what's happening there so they're cleaning the blood of the mat but you talked about having a little conversation and Powell here they give a caution and one for [Applause] flee that may change the tener of the match a bit David Taylor comes back to the middle and finds himself behind wow so they give a caution there and a penalty point awarded to Aaron Brooks to Taylor after all that activity now working from a deficit halfway through this opening three minute period again 6 minutes in total most points scored wins P your opponent win by 10 or more end it early right now Taylor just find to have more points than Brooks at this point for thir round totally disagree with that pass three Taylor's been the aggressor so far the whole match but he's in terrible hair very tenuous position the corner tack on two more and build the three nothing Advantage BRS wanted to go back up and the referee obliges here we go Aaron Brooks the top confidence right now in this match David Taylor in a hole and has to get get moving Taylor will be generating one point on offense in round one and shut out to this particular point so far in round number two this would be somewhat of a stunner Aaron Brooks certainly a great P Taylor has been nearly wless recently in his career especially against Americans coming in super hot lost in the last out his first loss to an American besides an injury default when he hurt his knees sever Le in 2019 his last loss to American came up the 2017 world team trials when he lost a couple of tight matches to Jadon Cox but right now he's in a deficit again against Aaron Brooks who got the penalty point and then scored a key to yeah he Taylor took a shot wasn't able to get a get a good finish position Brooks was able to come around Taylor trying to hang on but to no avail Brook's too strong keeps moving keeps moving stays with it able to take Taylor to the mat here for a two-point score David Taylor triy to summon everything he's got to overcome Aaron Brooks who won The Challenge tournament including oh nice shot but again heavy hips by Aaron Brooks not allowing David Taylor to get in a position to finish but he keeps driving forward he can get in get his hipss Underneath Him and now after to that heavy hips by Aaron Brooks staving off that attack by David Taylor certainly doing everything defensively to neutralize Tokyo Olympic gold medas three time world champ including backto back World titles David Taylor took him a while to become the number one wrestler in the US but once he did totally dominant both the best wrestler in the world by the United World Wrestling eration after 2018 it took him 6 years to make his first senior level W team finish second or third at Olympic or World trials to Jordan Burrows Jake Cox World Champs and he got that first world title in 2018 in the knee issue the following year but worked his way back in that year postponement of the Tokyo games probably AED his rehab from the knee issue even more and then he stormed his way to that gold that great take down Le to stun y of Iran get to the top step of a podium in Tokyo he's not going to get to Paris unless he finds away get at least a handful of points here against Aaron Brooks in the last 90 seconds of this period good action there by David Taylor ni shot referee calling for a passivity call against Aaron Brooks we get moving but Brooks content to stay in that head head and collar tie D Taylor will let no risk to him while he's there while he holds this risk but he make it again he's on the clock 18 seconds left but with that three-point lead he doesn't need to do much he doesn't need to take a risk here if he doesn't want to seemingly going going about his strategy cautiously maybe willing to concede that penalty point to David Taylor 50 seconds left let's Taylor in a position to win this match though he can get a twoo take to don't see the point going up on the board yet there it is a while put it up is up now and Taylor needs more than that to keep
