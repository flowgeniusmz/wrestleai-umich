Takedown tactics: the science behind wrestling success
There’s something primal about wrestling – two grapplers locked in a tense struggle, where raw strength meets cunning strategy. It’s a dance of leverage, momentum, and the will to win. And the key to mastering that dance? The takedown.
A well-timed takedown in wrestling can turn the tables in an instant. It’s both a powerful offensive weapon and a key way to avoid dangerous positions. But beyond brute force, what makes a takedown truly effective? Let’s break it down.

Contrast: Jumping Split Squat: 3 sets of 6 reps per leg. Sumo Deadlift: 3 sets of 6 reps. Contrast: Single Leg Lateral Hurdle Hop: 3 sets of 6 reps per leg.","8 Exercises For An Unstoppable Takedown
When it comes to incorporating strength training into the training regimen of wrestlers or martial artists, many coaches often make the mistake of using generalized exercises that may not have a direct carryover to their athletes' performance. However, to truly enhance skills in any sport, it is vital to break down the mechanics of the specific skill being performed. This holds true for complex techniques like leg attack takedowns, where exercises must focus on improving positioning and execution.
In this article, we will delve into four primary strength exercises that directly impact leg attack takedowns. These exercises target key areas of strength and athleticism, enabling wrestlers to optimize their performance on the mat. Additionally, we will explore explosive contrast movements that complement each exercise, further enhancing explosiveness and lateral drive. Get ready to transform your leg attack takedowns and dominate your opponents with these effective training techniques.
The barbell reverse lunge with a clean grip is a powerful exercise that improves the wrestler's stability when under the legs. By analyzing the positioning at the bottom of the lift, we can identify its direct correlation to a successful leg attack takedown. The stable ankle resembles the linear foot drive required after the initial penetration of a shot, while the knee and hip positions mimic those during a takedown. The loaded trunk, upright posture, and aligned thoracic spine simulate the resistance experienced during an opponent's defense.
Why choose the reverse lunge over the forward lunge? The reverse lunge involves driving the rear foot forward, replicating the movement required in a penetration shot. Conversely, a forward lunge would result in a backward drive, leading to an unfavorable position on the mat. To complement this exercise, incorporate the jumping split squat as a contrast movement. Focus on driving off the back toe with maximum force, propelling yourself off the ground for maximum speed.
The sumo deadlift is an ideal exercise for wrestlers due to its emphasis on lateral force. Unlike the conventional deadlift, the sumo deadlift requires generating significant lateral force into the ground. After securing your opponent's legs during an attack, the next step involves a lateral drive off the far foot. Linear drive during a takedown allows opponents to easily counter by retracting their hips and creating distance, jeopardizing your position. Enhancing lateral explosiveness is crucial for overpowering opponents and achieving successful takedowns.
As a contrast movement, incorporate the single-leg lateral hurdle hop. The emphasis here is on generating substantial lateral force, focusing on horizontal distance traveled rather than vertical height. Softly land on both feet on the other side, further developing the explosive lateral drive.
While horizontal pressing exercises are generally beneficial for pushing movements in matches or fights, a moderate-intensity close grip press for maximum speed from a standstill position can significantly enhance hand and striking speed. A slow reach during the penetration of a leg attack gives opponents more time to react and defend against your move. Observing the upper body during a leg attack, bent elbows and hands positioned a few inches from the chest are common. The arm reach is often performed without eccentric movement, resembling a dead pause.
The close grip floor catch press with a pause effectively targets the hand strike portion of a leg attack. The exercise emphasizes keeping the elbows at rest on the ground, maintaining the bar a few inches from the chest. The close grip also replicates the range of motion during elbow extension in contact sports, as most pushing movements occur within shoulder width. During the catch phase, release tension at the bottom and explosively drive the weight upward from a dead pause. Aim for a weight that doesn't require grinding. A training range of 75-85% of your 4-6 rep max is recommended.
For the contrast movement, try the kneeling medicine ball chest pass with a dead pause. Pause at the chest and explosively push the ball as fast as possible. Increase the distance or aim for specific targets or walls with each set to continually improve.
Isometric strength plays a significant role in mixed martial arts and wrestling, as athletes often need to hold positions against active resistance from opponents for extended periods. While horizontal and vertical pulling strength are commonly emphasized in wrestling programs, it is essential to recognize that pulling the legs toward oneself indicates poor penetration and improper knee/foot placement for executing an attack successfully.
A properly performed penetration shot positions the attacker's hips in front of the opponent's feet, with the arms wrapped around the legs. Overcoming the resistance of an opponent's defense requires exceptional horizontal isometric pulling strength. The inverted row is an excellent exercise for practicing horizontal isometric pulling strength, as it forces athletes to maintain a neutral spine. Opt for a neutral grip and squeeze the elbows in tightly at the top. Merely pulling to the chest is insufficient; focus on crunching the elbows in and activating the lat muscles, as if trying to hold an opponent's legs during resistance.
As a contrast movement, incorporate dynamic effort Pendlay rows. Use a resistance range of 60-70% of your one-rep max and perform sets of 2-3 reps. Focus on driving the elbows back as fast as possible, emphasizing speed rather than relying solely on arm strength. Squeeze the shoulder blades together at the top to maximize the benefits of the exercise.
Putting It Together: Sample Two-Day Training Split
To implement these exercises effectively, consider the following sample two-day training split:
Day 1:
Day 2:
Final Thoughts:
It is important to acknowledge that continuous practice of the skill itself is essential for improvement. However, incorporating specific strength exercises that target the mechanics and athleticism required in wrestling can significantly enhance performance. By carefully selecting exercises and understanding their direct relation to leg attack takedowns, wrestlers can make great strides in becoming unstoppable forces on the mat.

Mastering the Art of Takedowns in Freestyle Wrestling: A Comprehensive Guide
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling. If you are passionate about this dynamic combat sport and want to enhance your skills in taking down opponents, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we will delve into the essential techniques, strategies, and training drills that will empower you to dominate your opponents on the wrestling mat. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your takedown abilities, this guide is designed to provide you with valuable insights and expert advice to take your freestyle wrestling game to the next level.
Understanding the Basics of Takedowns
Takedowns are a fundamental aspect of freestyle wrestling. They involve swiftly and strategically taking down your opponent to gain control or score points. Understanding the basics of takedowns is crucial for any wrestler looking to excel in this dynamic sport.
Different Types of Takedowns
Single Leg Takedown: This is one of the most common takedown techniques used in freestyle wrestling. It involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs and swiftly driving them off balance to bring them down to the mat.
Double Leg Takedown: Similar to the single leg takedown, the double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent’s legs and using your body weight to knock them off balance and bring them down.
High Crotch Takedown: This takedown technique requires you to shoot in towards your opponent’s legs, driving your shoulder into their midsection. From there, you can lift and maneuver them to the ground.
Fireman’s Carry: The fireman’s carry is a more advanced takedown that involves throwing your opponent over your shoulder while maintaining control of their upper body. It requires good timing and technique but can be highly effective when executed correctly.
Strategies for Setting up Takedowns
Establishing Control: Before attempting a takedown, it’s essential to establish control over your opponent. This can be achieved through hand fighting, maintaining good posture, and creating angles to disrupt their balance.
Creating Openings: Look for opportunities to create openings for takedowns by feinting or faking attacks. This can force your opponent to react, opening up opportunities for you to execute a takedown.
Using Combinations: Utilize combinations of attacks to keep your opponent guessing and off balance. By chaining together different takedown attempts, you can increase your chances of successfully executing a takedown.
Key Techniques for Executing Takedowns
Level Change: A crucial aspect of executing a successful takedown is the ability to change levels. This involves lowering your body position while maintaining good posture, making it harder for your opponent to defend against your takedown attempts.
Explosiveness and Speed: Takedowns require explosive and quick movements. By training your explosiveness and speed through drills and exercises, you can enhance your ability to execute takedowns effectively.
Maintaining Balance: It’s important to maintain your own balance throughout the takedown process. This allows you to stay in control and quickly transition to other techniques if necessary.
Finishing the Takedown: Once you have initiated a takedown, focus on finishing it strong. This involves driving through your opponent, using your entire body to maintain control, and securing a dominant position on the mat.
Mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling takes time, practice, and a deep understanding of the basics. By familiarizing yourself with different types of takedowns, employing effective strategies, and honing key techniques, you can elevate your takedown game and become a formidable force on the wrestling mat.
Developing Strength and Conditioning
In order to excel in freestyle wrestling and master the art of takedowns, it is crucial to focus on developing strength and conditioning. This aspect of training plays a vital role in enhancing performance on the mat. By incorporating specific exercises for building core strength, cardiovascular training for endurance, and emphasizing the importance of flexibility and agility, wrestlers can greatly improve their overall abilities.
Specific Exercises for Building Core Strength
Core strength is fundamental in freestyle wrestling as it provides stability and power for executing takedowns effectively. Incorporating specific exercises targeting the core muscles can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. Some effective exercises for building core strength include:
Plank: The plank is a simple yet highly effective exercise for strengthening the core. Start by assuming a push-up position and then lower your forearms to the ground. Hold this position while maintaining a straight line from your head to your feet. Aim to gradually increase the duration of the hold as your core strength improves.
Russian Twists: This exercise targets the oblique muscles, which are crucial for generating rotational power during takedowns. Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly, keeping your back straight. Hold a weight or medicine ball in front of your chest and twist your torso from side to side, touching the weight or ball to the ground on each side.
Leg Raises: Leg raises help strengthen the lower abdominal muscles, which are essential for explosive movements in wrestling. Lie on your back with your legs straight and your hands by your sides. Lift your legs off the ground while keeping them straight, and then slowly lower them back down without touching the ground. Repeat for multiple sets.
Cardiovascular Training for Endurance
Endurance is another crucial aspect of freestyle wrestling, as matches can be physically demanding and often require sustained effort. Incorporating cardiovascular training into your routine can greatly improve your endurance levels. Here are some effective cardiovascular exercises for wrestlers:
Running: Running is a great cardiovascular exercise that helps build endurance and stamina. Incorporate both steady-state running for longer durations and interval training to simulate the intensity of wrestling matches. Interval training involves alternating between high-intensity sprints and recovery periods.
Cycling: Cycling is a low-impact cardiovascular exercise that can be beneficial for wrestlers. Whether you prefer indoor cycling or hitting the roads, it provides an excellent way to improve your endurance. Vary the intensity of your rides by incorporating intervals or incorporating hill climbs to simulate the demands of wrestling.
Jumping Rope: Jumping rope is not only a great warm-up exercise but also an effective way to improve cardiovascular fitness. It is a high-intensity exercise that engages multiple muscle groups and helps improve coordination and footwork.
Importance of Flexibility and Agility
Flexibility and agility are key components of successful takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Being able to move swiftly and fluidly while maintaining balance is crucial for executing techniques effectively. Here are some important aspects to consider:
Dynamic Stretching: Incorporate dynamic stretching exercises into your warm-up routine before training or competing. Dynamic stretching involves continuous movement through a full range of motion and helps improve flexibility and joint mobility. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, and torso twists.
Plyometric Exercises: Plyometric exercises, such as box jumps or lateral bounds, help improve agility and explosive power. These exercises involve quick and powerful movements that enhance muscle elasticity and coordination.
Yoga or Pilates: Engaging in regular yoga or Pilates sessions can greatly improve flexibility, balance, and body control. These practices also promote core strength and stability, which are essential for executing takedowns with precision.
By incorporating these exercises and emphasizing the importance of strength and conditioning, core strength, cardiovascular training, flexibility, and agility, wrestlers can enhance their performance in freestyle wrestling and ultimately master the art of takedowns. Remember, consistent practice and dedication are key to achieving success in any sport.
Mastering the Mechanics of Takedowns
Proper Stance and Balance
In the world of freestyle wrestling, having a proper stance and balance is crucial to mastering the art of takedowns. Your stance determines your readiness and stability while engaging with your opponent. Here are some key points to remember:
Gripping and Controlling Techniques
Once you have established a solid stance, the gripping and controlling techniques play a vital role in executing successful takedowns. Here’s what you need to know:
Footwork and Timing
Apart from having a strong stance and effective gripping techniques, footwork and timing are essential components of mastering takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Consider the following factors:
By understanding and practicing the mechanics of takedowns, focusing on proper stance and balance, gripping and controlling techniques, as well as footwork and timing, you can elevate your freestyle wrestling skills to new heights. Mastering these fundamental aspects will greatly enhance your ability to execute effective takedowns and gain a competitive edge in the sport.
Countering and Defending Against Takedowns
Recognizing and Reacting to Opponent’s Attacks
In freestyle wrestling, the ability to recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks is crucial when countering and defending against takedowns. Being able to anticipate your opponent’s movements and understand their preferred techniques will give you a significant advantage in defending against their attacks.
To effectively recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks, it is essential to develop a keen sense of observation. Pay close attention to their footwork, body positioning, and any subtle cues that may indicate an impending takedown attempt. By studying your opponent’s patterns and tendencies, you can better prepare yourself to counter their attacks.
Quick reflexes and agility are key when reacting to your opponent’s attacks. As soon as you perceive an incoming takedown attempt, you must swiftly adjust your stance and position yourself to neutralize their attack. Maintaining a low center of gravity and keeping your balance will make it harder for your opponent to execute a successful takedown.
Effective Counter Techniques
Having a repertoire of effective counter techniques will greatly enhance your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are a few techniques that can be utilized to counter your opponent’s attacks:
Sprawl: The sprawl technique involves quickly extending your legs backward while dropping your hips to the mat. By doing so, you create a wider base and make it difficult for your opponent to secure a takedown.
Whizzer: The whizzer, also known as an overhook, is a defensive move where you use your arm to control your opponent’s attacking arm. This technique allows you to redirect their momentum and potentially gain an advantageous position.
Front Headlock: When your opponent attempts a takedown, you can react by securing a front headlock. This move involves wrapping your arms around your opponent’s head and controlling their upper body, preventing them from completing the takedown.
Granby Roll: The granby roll is an effective technique to counter a takedown and quickly regain control. It involves rolling away from your opponent’s attack while using your momentum to reverse the situation.
Defensive Strategies and Tactics
In addition to individual counter techniques, implementing defensive strategies and tactics can greatly improve your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are some defensive strategies to consider:
Maintain a Strong Base: By keeping a strong and balanced stance, you make it more challenging for your opponent to take you down. Focus on keeping your feet shoulder-width apart and distributing your weight evenly.
Hand Fighting: Engaging in hand fighting with your opponent can disrupt their attempts to initiate takedowns. By controlling their hands and wrists, you limit their ability to secure a successful takedown.
Circle and Angle: Instead of standing directly in front of your opponent, use circular footwork and angles to make it harder for them to shoot for a takedown. Constantly moving and changing angles forces your opponent to adjust and can create openings for counters.
Utilize Defensive Drills: Incorporate defensive drills into your training routine to improve your reflexes, timing, and defensive instincts. Practice scenarios where your opponent attempts takedowns, and focus on reacting quickly and effectively countering their attacks.
By recognizing and reacting to your opponent’s attacks, utilizing effective counter techniques, and implementing defensive strategies, you will enhance your ability to counter and defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Constant practice and refinement of these skills will lead to mastery and success on the wrestling mat.
Strategies for Competition
Creating an Effective Game Plan
Having a well-defined game plan is crucial in freestyle wrestling competitions. It allows wrestlers to approach matches with a strategic mindset, maximizing their chances of success. Here are some key steps to creating an effective game plan:
Study your opponent: Before the match, research and analyze your opponent’s previous performances. Look for patterns, strengths, and weaknesses that can be exploited during the bout. This information will help you develop a targeted strategy.
Identify your strengths: Assess your own wrestling style and identify your strongest techniques and moves. Build your game plan around these strengths to capitalize on your skills during the match.
Set specific objectives: Determine specific goals and objectives for the match. These could include scoring a certain number of takedowns, avoiding specific moves from your opponent, or dominating a particular position. Having clear objectives will keep you focused and motivated during the competition.
Practice your strategy: Once you have identified your game plan, practice it extensively during training sessions. Work on executing your chosen techniques and movements flawlessly to build muscle memory and confidence.
Analyzing and Exploiting Opponent’s Weaknesses
One of the most effective strategies in freestyle wrestling is identifying and exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses. By studying their previous matches and observing their style, you can develop a game plan that targets their vulnerabilities. Here’s how to go about it:
Watch their matches: Analyze your opponent’s previous matches to identify any recurring weaknesses or areas where they struggle. Pay attention to their reactions in different situations and take note of any recurring mistakes they make.
Identify common weaknesses: Once you have observed your opponent’s matches, look for common weaknesses that can be exploited. These could be technical flaws, predictable reactions, or vulnerabilities in certain positions. Understanding these weaknesses will help you plan your attacks accordingly.
Develop counter strategies: Based on the weaknesses you have identified, develop specific counter strategies. Practice techniques and moves that directly exploit your opponent’s vulnerabilities, allowing you to gain an advantage during the match.
Stay adaptable: While it is important to exploit your opponent’s weaknesses, it is equally crucial to adapt your strategy during the match. If your initial plan doesn’t yield the desired results, be prepared to make quick adjustments and capitalize on any new openings that arise.
Mental Preparation for Matches
Mental preparation plays a vital role in freestyle wrestling competitions. It helps wrestlers stay focused, confident, and resilient throughout the match. Here are some key aspects of mental preparation that can enhance your performance:
Visualization techniques: Before the match, spend time visualizing yourself executing your game plan flawlessly. Imagine each move, takedown, and counter in vivid detail. This mental rehearsal helps build confidence and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenges.
Positive self-talk: Replace negative thoughts and self-doubt with positive affirmations. Remind yourself of your strengths, skills, and previous successes. Repeat empowering phrases to boost your confidence and maintain a positive mindset.
Controlled breathing: Deep, controlled breathing techniques can help calm your nerves and reduce anxiety before and during the match. Practice rhythmic breathing exercises to center yourself and stay focused on the present moment.
Develop a pre-match routine: Establish a consistent pre-match routine that helps you get in the right mindset. This routine could include warm-up exercises, visualization sessions, or listening to motivational music. Having a routine creates a sense of familiarity and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenge.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of physical prowess and mental acuity. By strategizing effectively, exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses, and mentally preparing for matches, you can significantly enhance your performance on the mat.
Drills and Training Exercises
Partner Drills for Takedown Practice
One of the most effective ways to improve your takedown skills in freestyle wrestling is through partner drills. These drills allow you to practice your techniques in a controlled setting with a training partner. Here are some partner drills that can help you master the art of takedowns:
Double Leg Takedown Drill: Start by facing your partner in a wrestling stance. Initiate the drill by shooting in for a double leg takedown. Your partner should sprawl and defend while you focus on driving through and completing the takedown. Repeat this drill multiple times, alternating roles with your partner.
Single Leg Takedown Drill: Similar to the double leg takedown drill, this drill focuses on executing a single leg takedown. Begin by gripping your partner’s collar tie or wrist control, then quickly transition to a single leg attack. Your partner should defend by sprawling and countering. Practice this drill with both partners taking turns as the attacker and defender.
Hand Fighting Drill: Hand fighting is crucial for setting up takedowns and gaining control over your opponent. In this drill, focus on developing your hand fighting skills by engaging in controlled sparring with your partner. Work on establishing dominant grips, clearing ties, and creating openings for takedowns. Remember to maintain proper technique and intensity throughout the drill.
Solo Drills for Technique Refinement
In addition to partner drills, solo drills are essential for refining your takedown techniques and improving your overall performance in freestyle wrestling. These drills allow you to focus on specific movements and body mechanics without the need for a training partner. Here are some solo drills that can help you enhance your takedown skills:
Shadow Wrestling: Shadow wrestling involves simulating takedowns and defensive movements without a partner. Stand in front of a mirror or an imaginary opponent and practice your takedown techniques. Focus on proper footwork, hip movement, and penetration steps. Visualize your opponent’s reactions and work on your timing and precision.
Shot Drills: Shot drills are designed to improve your speed, explosiveness, and precision when shooting for takedowns. Set up a series of cones or markers on the ground, and practice shooting from various distances. Start slowly, focusing on proper form, and gradually increase your speed and intensity. Challenge yourself by incorporating level changes and fakes into your shots.
Resistance Band Drills: Resistance bands can be a valuable tool for developing strength and power in your takedown movements. Attach a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point and work on your takedown motions against the resistance. This will help you build explosive power and improve your ability to finish takedowns against tough opponents.
Live Wrestling and Scrimmage Sessions
While drills and solo exercises are essential for skill development, nothing can replicate the intensity and unpredictability of live wrestling. Engaging in live wrestling sessions and scrimmages is crucial for applying your techniques in real-time situations. Here are some tips for making the most of live wrestling sessions:
Focus on Applying Techniques: Use live wrestling sessions as an opportunity to practice the takedowns you’ve been drilling. Focus on executing your techniques against resisting opponents and adapting to their reactions. Pay attention to your positioning, timing, and setups during live situations.
Experiment and Learn: Live wrestling sessions provide a platform for experimentation and learning. Don’t be afraid to try new techniques or variations of existing ones. Take risks, analyze the outcomes, and learn from both successful and unsuccessful attempts. This will help you expand your arsenal of takedowns and develop a well-rounded skillset.

After the penetration step and positioning start coming together then we move on to working more ties. I would love to hear your opinion on what setups you ...,"How To Teach Takedown Setups
One of the most popular questions I get from coaches is…
“what setups to focus on first with wrestlers?”
I have to be honest, this changed over the years for me.  It’s no wonder coaches have questions about teaching the neutral position… it’s easily the toughest position to get wrestlers to master.
Top position is by far the easiest, the key there is to teach technique and then develop tenacity.  Bottom definitely has its set of difficulties, but is nowhere near as complex as neutral.
“Get them good at control ties”  and my logic would have been “they need to be able to get ahold of opponents in order to force their style and even the most non-athletic wrestler can use them.”
Although this may be true as wrestlers develop, gain experience and climb the ranks…
In the developmental stages I don’t believe it to be true and after years fiddling with different teaching methods, I undoubtedly had the most success with the method I’m about to cover.
First, I want to define the three categories of setups within the system I have developed.
I want to be clear here…  When I say open setup I don’t mean that their is no contact.  Wrestlers should learn to go in and out of ties and this process should be physical.  They should be moving their feet, faking ties and faking shots.
Watch this video for a more detailed breakdown on Open Setups:
Examples of loose control ties are; Inside Ties, Collar Ties, Elbow Control and more
Watch this video for a detailed breakdown on the Inside Tie
Tieups that are considered control ties are Underhooks, Front Headlocks and Russian 2-on-1’s.
Watch this video for a detailed breakdown on the Russian 2-on-1:
When working with developing wrestlers that are trying to master shots and finishes it is not necessary to over complicate the tieup/setup process.
With this in mind, I prefer to focus heavily on using open setups.  This allows wrestlers to focus on the actual shot and finishes combined with developing the habits of moving, faking shots, faking ties.  All along learning to stalk, close the gap safely and snap out of ties.
Not to say that loose control ties and control ties shouldn’t be introduced… Especially to individuals that may have special tactical needs. When making these decision, you should take into consideration their weight class, how old they are, and the experience level of the athletes they will be facing.
Techniques and strategies for clearing all tie ups should also be covered soon as well, especially if you are dealing with high school athletes, where they might be facing wrestlers that use a variety of tieups effectively.
In conclusion, I like to start out having developing wrestlers focus on executing shots and finishes from open ties.  Setting opponents up from the open is going to develop crucial movement skills and allow them to focus on the techniques and positions needed to lay the foundation of solid leg attacks.  After the penetration step and positioning start coming together then we move on to working more ties.
I would love to hear your opinion on what setups you think developing wrestlers need to focus on as well as any success or failure stories you might have.  Please post any feedback below.

Practice these moves regularly, focusing on proper technique, timing, and maintaining control, and you’ll be well on your way to becoming a skilled wrestler.
Escapes and Reversals
In freestyle wrestling, having effective escape and reversal techniques is crucial for beginners who want to gain an advantage over their opponents. Escapes and reversals allow wrestlers to break free from a disadvantageous position and turn the tables in their favor. Here are three essential escapes and reversals that every beginner should learn:
Stand-Up Escape
The stand-up escape is one of the most basic and commonly used techniques in wrestling. It involves quickly getting back on your feet from the bottom position. To perform a stand-up escape, follow these steps:
Mastering the stand-up escape is essential for beginners as it allows you to quickly regain control and avoid giving your opponent any easy points.

Peterson Roll
The Peterson roll is a technique that allows you to reverse your opponent and gain control from the bottom position. It requires a combination of speed, technique, and timing. Here’s how you can execute a Peterson roll:

Practice these techniques diligently to improve your overall wrestling skills and increase your chances of success on the mat.
Pinning Techniques
Half Nelson
The half nelson is one of the most fundamental and effective pinning techniques in freestyle wrestling. It involves controlling your opponent’s upper body by using your arm and shoulder to apply pressure on their neck and shoulder. To execute the half nelson, follow these steps:
The half nelson is a versatile technique that can be used to set up other pinning moves or to control your opponent’s movements during a match. It requires proper technique and timing to execute effectively, so beginners should practice it extensively before using it in a competitive setting.

The cradle is another effective pinning technique that involves immobilizing your opponent by securing both their arms and head. It is a great move to use when you have gained control of your opponent’s upper body. Follow these steps to execute the cradle:
The cradle is a highly effective move for securing a pin, as it restricts your opponent’s movement and makes it difficult for them to escape. It requires coordination and strength to execute properly, so beginners should focus on mastering the technique before using it in live matches.
Armbar
The armbar is a pinning technique that focuses on controlling and immobilizing your opponent’s arm. It can be used to set up a pin or to create opportunities for other offensive moves. Follow these steps to execute the armbar:

It requires proper technique and control to execute effectively, so beginners should practice it under the guidance of a coach or experienced wrestler.
Defense Techniques
Sprawl
One of the most crucial defensive techniques in freestyle wrestling is the sprawl. The sprawl is a technique used to defend against an opponent’s takedown attempt. It involves dropping the hips and sprawling the legs backward when the opponent shoots in for a takedown.
By performing a sprawl, a wrestler can avoid getting taken down and maintain a dominant position on the mat. This defensive move requires good timing and quick reflexes to anticipate the opponent’s takedown attempt and react swiftly.
Front Headlock
Another effective defense technique in freestyle wrestling is the front headlock. This technique involves controlling the opponent’s head and neck from the front while standing or on the ground.
When an opponent initiates an attack, the wrestler can quickly secure a front headlock position by wrapping their arm around the opponent’s neck and grabbing their own wrist. From this position, the wrestler can exert control over the opponent’s movements and prevent them from executing their techniques effectively.
The front headlock can be used to counter an opponent’s takedown attempt or to set up various offensive moves such as throws or chokes. It requires good leverage and upper body strength to maintain control over the opponent while defending against their attacks.
Whizzer
The whizzer is another essential defensive technique that wrestlers utilize to counter an opponent’s takedown attempt. This move involves using a well-timed hip and arm movement to disrupt the opponent’s attack and regain control of the match.
When an opponent tries to execute a takedown, the wrestler can counter by sprawling one leg back while driving their hip into the opponent’s side. Simultaneously, they can wrap their arm around the opponent’s arm or waist, creating a whizzer position. This helps in neutralizing the opponent’s attack and turning the situation to their advantage.
The whizzer can be used to launch a counter-attack, escape from a precarious position, or gain control over the opponent’s movements. It requires a combination of agility, timing, and technique to execute effectively and prevent the opponent from scoring points.
Mastering these defense techniques – the sprawl, front headlock, and whizzer – is crucial for beginners in freestyle wrestling. By honing these skills, wrestlers can effectively defend against their opponents’ attacks, maintain control on the mat, and create opportunities for their own offensive moves.

Understanding the Basics of Takedowns
Takedowns are a fundamental aspect of freestyle wrestling. They involve swiftly and strategically taking down your opponent to gain control or score points. Understanding the basics of takedowns is crucial for any wrestler looking to excel in this dynamic sport.
Different Types of Takedowns
Single Leg Takedown: This is one of the most common takedown techniques used in freestyle wrestling. It involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs and swiftly driving them off balance to bring them down to the mat.
Double Leg Takedown: Similar to the single leg takedown, the double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent’s legs and using your body weight to knock them off balance and bring them down.
High Crotch Takedown: This takedown technique requires you to shoot in towards your opponent’s legs, driving your shoulder into their midsection. From there, you can lift and maneuver them to the ground.
Fireman’s Carry: The fireman’s carry is a more advanced takedown that involves throwing your opponent over your shoulder while maintaining control of their upper body. It requires good timing and technique but can be highly effective when executed correctly.
Strategies for Setting up Takedowns
Establishing Control: Before attempting a takedown, it’s essential to establish control over your opponent. This can be achieved through hand fighting, maintaining good posture, and creating angles to disrupt their balance.
Creating Openings: Look for opportunities to create openings for takedowns by feinting or faking attacks. This can force your opponent to react, opening up opportunities for you to execute a takedown.
Using Combinations: Utilize combinations of attacks to keep your opponent guessing and off balance. By chaining together different takedown attempts, you can increase your chances of successfully executing a takedown.
Key Techniques for Executing Takedowns
Level Change: A crucial aspect of executing a successful takedown is the ability to change levels. This involves lowering your body position while maintaining good posture, making it harder for your opponent to defend against your takedown attempts.
Explosiveness and Speed: Takedowns require explosive and quick movements. By training your explosiveness and speed through drills and exercises, you can enhance your ability to execute takedowns effectively.
Maintaining Balance: It’s important to maintain your own balance throughout the takedown process. This allows you to stay in control and quickly transition to other techniques if necessary.
Finishing the Takedown: Once you have initiated a takedown, focus on finishing it strong. This involves driving through your opponent, using your entire body to maintain control, and securing a dominant position on the mat.
Mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling takes time, practice, and a deep understanding of the basics. By familiarizing yourself with different types of takedowns, employing effective strategies, and honing key techniques, you can elevate your takedown game and become a formidable force on the wrestling mat.
Developing Strength and Conditioning
In order to excel in freestyle wrestling and master the art of takedowns, it is crucial to focus on developing strength and conditioning. This aspect of training plays a vital role in enhancing performance on the mat. By incorporating specific exercises for building core strength, cardiovascular training for endurance, and emphasizing the importance of flexibility and agility, wrestlers can greatly improve their overall abilities.
Specific Exercises for Building Core Strength
Core strength is fundamental in freestyle wrestling as it provides stability and power for executing takedowns effectively. Incorporating specific exercises targeting the core muscles can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. Some effective exercises for building core strength include:
Plank: The plank is a simple yet highly effective exercise for strengthening the core. Start by assuming a push-up position and then lower your forearms to the ground. Hold this position while maintaining a straight line from your head to your feet. Aim to gradually increase the duration of the hold as your core strength improves.
Russian Twists: This exercise targets the oblique muscles, which are crucial for generating rotational power during takedowns. Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly, keeping your back straight. Hold a weight or medicine ball in front of your chest and twist your torso from side to side, touching the weight or ball to the ground on each side.
Leg Raises: Leg raises help strengthen the lower abdominal muscles, which are essential for explosive movements in wrestling. Lie on your back with your legs straight and your hands by your sides. Lift your legs off the ground while keeping them straight, and then slowly lower them back down without touching the ground. Repeat for multiple sets.
Cardiovascular Training for Endurance
Endurance is another crucial aspect of freestyle wrestling, as matches can be physically demanding and often require sustained effort. Incorporating cardiovascular training into your routine can greatly improve your endurance levels. Here are some effective cardiovascular exercises for wrestlers:
Running: Running is a great cardiovascular exercise that helps build endurance and stamina. Incorporate both steady-state running for longer durations and interval training to simulate the intensity of wrestling matches. Interval training involves alternating between high-intensity sprints and recovery periods.
Cycling: Cycling is a low-impact cardiovascular exercise that can be beneficial for wrestlers. Whether you prefer indoor cycling or hitting the roads, it provides an excellent way to improve your endurance. Vary the intensity of your rides by incorporating intervals or incorporating hill climbs to simulate the demands of wrestling.
Jumping Rope: Jumping rope is not only a great warm-up exercise but also an effective way to improve cardiovascular fitness. It is a high-intensity exercise that engages multiple muscle groups and helps improve coordination and footwork.
Importance of Flexibility and Agility
Flexibility and agility are key components of successful takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Being able to move swiftly and fluidly while maintaining balance is crucial for executing techniques effectively. Here are some important aspects to consider:
Dynamic Stretching: Incorporate dynamic stretching exercises into your warm-up routine before training or competing. Dynamic stretching involves continuous movement through a full range of motion and helps improve flexibility and joint mobility. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, and torso twists.
Plyometric Exercises: Plyometric exercises, such as box jumps or lateral bounds, help improve agility and explosive power. These exercises involve quick and powerful movements that enhance muscle elasticity and coordination.
Yoga or Pilates: Engaging in regular yoga or Pilates sessions can greatly improve flexibility, balance, and body control. These practices also promote core strength and stability, which are essential for executing takedowns with precision.
By incorporating these exercises and emphasizing the importance of strength and conditioning, core strength, cardiovascular training, flexibility, and agility, wrestlers can enhance their performance in freestyle wrestling and ultimately master the art of takedowns. Remember, consistent practice and dedication are key to achieving success in any sport.
Mastering the Mechanics of Takedowns
Proper Stance and Balance
In the world of freestyle wrestling, having a proper stance and balance is crucial to mastering the art of takedowns. Your stance determines your readiness and stability while engaging with your opponent. Here are some key points to remember:
Gripping and Controlling Techniques
Once you have established a solid stance, the gripping and controlling techniques play a vital role in executing successful takedowns. Here’s what you need to know:
Footwork and Timing
Apart from having a strong stance and effective gripping techniques, footwork and timing are essential components of mastering takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Consider the following factors:
By understanding and practicing the mechanics of takedowns, focusing on proper stance and balance, gripping and controlling techniques, as well as footwork and timing, you can elevate your freestyle wrestling skills to new heights. Mastering these fundamental aspects will greatly enhance your ability to execute effective takedowns and gain a competitive edge in the sport.
Countering and Defending Against Takedowns
Recognizing and Reacting to Opponent’s Attacks
In freestyle wrestling, the ability to recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks is crucial when countering and defending against takedowns. Being able to anticipate your opponent’s movements and understand their preferred techniques will give you a significant advantage in defending against their attacks.
To effectively recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks, it is essential to develop a keen sense of observation. Pay close attention to their footwork, body positioning, and any subtle cues that may indicate an impending takedown attempt. By studying your opponent’s patterns and tendencies, you can better prepare yourself to counter their attacks.
Quick reflexes and agility are key when reacting to your opponent’s attacks. As soon as you perceive an incoming takedown attempt, you must swiftly adjust your stance and position yourself to neutralize their attack. Maintaining a low center of gravity and keeping your balance will make it harder for your opponent to execute a successful takedown.
Effective Counter Techniques
Having a repertoire of effective counter techniques will greatly enhance your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are a few techniques that can be utilized to counter your opponent’s attacks:
Sprawl: The sprawl technique involves quickly extending your legs backward while dropping your hips to the mat. By doing so, you create a wider base and make it difficult for your opponent to secure a takedown.
Whizzer: The whizzer, also known as an overhook, is a defensive move where you use your arm to control your opponent’s attacking arm. This technique allows you to redirect their momentum and potentially gain an advantageous position.
Front Headlock: When your opponent attempts a takedown, you can react by securing a front headlock. This move involves wrapping your arms around your opponent’s head and controlling their upper body, preventing them from completing the takedown.
Granby Roll: The granby roll is an effective technique to counter a takedown and quickly regain control. It involves rolling away from your opponent’s attack while using your momentum to reverse the situation.
Defensive Strategies and Tactics
In addition to individual counter techniques, implementing defensive strategies and tactics can greatly improve your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are some defensive strategies to consider:
Maintain a Strong Base: By keeping a strong and balanced stance, you make it more challenging for your opponent to take you down. Focus on keeping your feet shoulder-width apart and distributing your weight evenly.
Hand Fighting: Engaging in hand fighting with your opponent can disrupt their attempts to initiate takedowns. By controlling their hands and wrists, you limit their ability to secure a successful takedown.
Circle and Angle: Instead of standing directly in front of your opponent, use circular footwork and angles to make it harder for them to shoot for a takedown. Constantly moving and changing angles forces your opponent to adjust and can create openings for counters.
Utilize Defensive Drills: Incorporate defensive drills into your training routine to improve your reflexes, timing, and defensive instincts. Practice scenarios where your opponent attempts takedowns, and focus on reacting quickly and effectively countering their attacks.
By recognizing and reacting to your opponent’s attacks, utilizing effective counter techniques, and implementing defensive strategies, you will enhance your ability to counter and defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Constant practice and refinement of these skills will lead to mastery and success on the wrestling mat.
Strategies for Competition
Creating an Effective Game Plan
Having a well-defined game plan is crucial in freestyle wrestling competitions. It allows wrestlers to approach matches with a strategic mindset, maximizing their chances of success. Here are some key steps to creating an effective game plan:
Study your opponent: Before the match, research and analyze your opponent’s previous performances. Look for patterns, strengths, and weaknesses that can be exploited during the bout. This information will help you develop a targeted strategy.
Identify your strengths: Assess your own wrestling style and identify your strongest techniques and moves. Build your game plan around these strengths to capitalize on your skills during the match.
Set specific objectives: Determine specific goals and objectives for the match. These could include scoring a certain number of takedowns, avoiding specific moves from your opponent, or dominating a particular position. Having clear objectives will keep you focused and motivated during the competition.
Practice your strategy: Once you have identified your game plan, practice it extensively during training sessions. Work on executing your chosen techniques and movements flawlessly to build muscle memory and confidence.
Analyzing and Exploiting Opponent’s Weaknesses
One of the most effective strategies in freestyle wrestling is identifying and exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses. By studying their previous matches and observing their style, you can develop a game plan that targets their vulnerabilities. Here’s how to go about it:
Watch their matches: Analyze your opponent’s previous matches to identify any recurring weaknesses or areas where they struggle. Pay attention to their reactions in different situations and take note of any recurring mistakes they make.
Identify common weaknesses: Once you have observed your opponent’s matches, look for common weaknesses that can be exploited. These could be technical flaws, predictable reactions, or vulnerabilities in certain positions. Understanding these weaknesses will help you plan your attacks accordingly.
Develop counter strategies: Based on the weaknesses you have identified, develop specific counter strategies. Practice techniques and moves that directly exploit your opponent’s vulnerabilities, allowing you to gain an advantage during the match.
Stay adaptable: While it is important to exploit your opponent’s weaknesses, it is equally crucial to adapt your strategy during the match. If your initial plan doesn’t yield the desired results, be prepared to make quick adjustments and capitalize on any new openings that arise.
Mental Preparation for Matches
Mental preparation plays a vital role in freestyle wrestling competitions. It helps wrestlers stay focused, confident, and resilient throughout the match. Here are some key aspects of mental preparation that can enhance your performance:
Visualization techniques: Before the match, spend time visualizing yourself executing your game plan flawlessly. Imagine each move, takedown, and counter in vivid detail. This mental rehearsal helps build confidence and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenges.
Positive self-talk: Replace negative thoughts and self-doubt with positive affirmations. Remind yourself of your strengths, skills, and previous successes. Repeat empowering phrases to boost your confidence and maintain a positive mindset.
Controlled breathing: Deep, controlled breathing techniques can help calm your nerves and reduce anxiety before and during the match. Practice rhythmic breathing exercises to center yourself and stay focused on the present moment.
Develop a pre-match routine: Establish a consistent pre-match routine that helps you get in the right mindset. This routine could include warm-up exercises, visualization sessions, or listening to motivational music. Having a routine creates a sense of familiarity and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenge.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of physical prowess and mental acuity. By strategizing effectively, exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses, and mentally preparing for matches, you can significantly enhance your performance on the mat.
Drills and Training Exercises
Partner Drills for Takedown Practice
One of the most effective ways to improve your takedown skills in freestyle wrestling is through partner drills. These drills allow you to practice your techniques in a controlled setting with a training partner. Here are some partner drills that can help you master the art of takedowns:
Double Leg Takedown Drill: Start by facing your partner in a wrestling stance. Initiate the drill by shooting in for a double leg takedown. Your partner should sprawl and defend while you focus on driving through and completing the takedown. Repeat this drill multiple times, alternating roles with your partner.
Single Leg Takedown Drill: Similar to the double leg takedown drill, this drill focuses on executing a single leg takedown. Begin by gripping your partner’s collar tie or wrist control, then quickly transition to a single leg attack. Your partner should defend by sprawling and countering. Practice this drill with both partners taking turns as the attacker and defender.
Hand Fighting Drill: Hand fighting is crucial for setting up takedowns and gaining control over your opponent. In this drill, focus on developing your hand fighting skills by engaging in controlled sparring with your partner. Work on establishing dominant grips, clearing ties, and creating openings for takedowns. Remember to maintain proper technique and intensity throughout the drill.
Solo Drills for Technique Refinement
In addition to partner drills, solo drills are essential for refining your takedown techniques and improving your overall performance in freestyle wrestling. These drills allow you to focus on specific movements and body mechanics without the need for a training partner. Here are some solo drills that can help you enhance your takedown skills:
Shadow Wrestling: Shadow wrestling involves simulating takedowns and defensive movements without a partner. Stand in front of a mirror or an imaginary opponent and practice your takedown techniques. Focus on proper footwork, hip movement, and penetration steps. Visualize your opponent’s reactions and work on your timing and precision.
Shot Drills: Shot drills are designed to improve your speed, explosiveness, and precision when shooting for takedowns. Set up a series of cones or markers on the ground, and practice shooting from various distances. Start slowly, focusing on proper form, and gradually increase your speed and intensity. Challenge yourself by incorporating level changes and fakes into your shots.
Resistance Band Drills: Resistance bands can be a valuable tool for developing strength and power in your takedown movements. Attach a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point and work on your takedown motions against the resistance. This will help you build explosive power and improve your ability to finish takedowns against tough opponents.
Live Wrestling and Scrimmage Sessions
While drills and solo exercises are essential for skill development, nothing can replicate the intensity and unpredictability of live wrestling. Engaging in live wrestling sessions and scrimmages is crucial for applying your techniques in real-time situations. Here are some tips for making the most of live wrestling sessions:
Focus on Applying Techniques: Use live wrestling sessions as an opportunity to practice the takedowns you’ve been drilling. Focus on executing your techniques against resisting opponents and adapting to their reactions. Pay attention to your positioning, timing, and setups during live situations.
Experiment and Learn: Live wrestling sessions provide a platform for experimentation and learning. Don’t be afraid to try new techniques or variations of existing ones. Take risks, analyze the outcomes, and learn from both successful and unsuccessful attempts. This will help you expand your arsenal of takedowns and develop a well-rounded skillset.
Seek Feedback and Spar with Different Partners: During live wrestling sessions, actively seek feedback from coaches, teammates, or more experienced wrestlers. They can provide valuable insights into your takedown techniques, positioning, and overall performance. Additionally, try to wrestle with a variety of partners to expose yourself to different styles and challenges.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires consistent practice, dedication, and a willingness to learn from both successes and failures. By incorporating partner drills, solo exercises, and live wrestling sessions into your training routine, you can significantly improve your takedown skills and become a formidable competitor in the sport.
In conclusion, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of technique, strength, and strategy. It is essential to understand the fundamentals of positioning, footwork, and timing to successfully execute takedowns. Additionally, building strength and endurance through regular training and conditioning is crucial for maintaining control and overpowering opponents. Moreover, having a strategic approach, such as setting up takedowns with feints or capitalizing on an opponent’s weaknesses, can greatly increase the chances of success. By continuously honing these skills and incorporating them into one’s training regimen, wrestlers can elevate their performance and become formidable competitors in the sport of freestyle wrestling.

Why Takedowns are Important
In the world of folk-style wrestling, mastering takedowns is the key to success on the mat. Understanding why takedowns are crucial can significantly impact a wrestler’s overall performance, setting the stage for victory. A recent junior high wrestling tournament vividly illustrates the pivotal role takedowns play in match outcomes.
Consider this scenario: Many skilled wrestlers found themselves on the losing end of matches by a slim margin of two points or less. Notably, the common factor in many of these matches was a takedown scored in the first period. Coaches often assert, “If you can take anyone down, you will win the match.” Let’s delve into an illustrative example that underscores the significance of this adage.
Example Scenario: Wrestler A vs. Wrestler B
This scenario serves as a poignant reminder that excelling in takedowns can compensate for shortcomings in other facets of wrestling. While it is essential to be well-rounded and proficient in all technical aspects, the ability to secure takedowns lays a solid foundation for success.
In essence, takedowns set the tone for a match, offering wrestlers an opportunity to establish dominance early on. A wrestler who can consistently execute effective takedowns places themselves in a favorable position, both strategically and psychologically. By seizing control of the scoring and dictating the pace, a wrestler with superior takedown skills can secure not just points but, more importantly, a pathway to victory on the wrestling mat.
How to Become a Master at Take Downs
Becoming a Master at Takedowns: A Step-by-Step Guide
Discover Your Signature Moves:
The first crucial step is to identify three takedowns that resonate with you. These should be moves that feel natural and align with your wrestling style. Everyone is different, so it’s essential to choose techniques that complement your strengths and preferences.
Study and Practice:
Once you’ve selected your three favorite takedowns, dive deep into studying them. Analyze the mechanics, timing, and nuances of each move. Dedicate extensive practice time to these takedowns until you can execute them in practice without conscious thought. This repetitive practice builds muscle memory and familiarity.
Application in Matches:
Transition from practice to live matches. Start incorporating your chosen takedowns into your wrestling matches. Pay attention to how well you can execute them under real match conditions. This phase is crucial for refining your technique and adapting the moves to different opponents and scenarios.
Mastered Three? Rinse and Repeat:
Once you’ve achieved a level of mastery with your initial three takedowns, don’t rush to learn new moves. Instead, replicate the process. Identify three more takedowns that complement your existing skill set and repeat the cycle of studying, practicing, and applying them in matches.
Depth, Not Breadth:
The key to becoming a master at takedowns is depth, not breadth. Elite wrestlers often have a handful of go-to moves, their “bread and butter.” Strive to be exceptional at a select few rather than mediocre at many. This focused expertise gives you a distinct advantage on the mat.
Confidence and Consistency:
As you accumulate a repertoire of mastered takedowns, your confidence in matches will soar. The goal is to reach a point where you feel you can take anyone down with your chosen moves consistently. This confidence translates into a mental edge over opponents.
Continuous Improvement:
Wrestling is a dynamic sport, and there’s always room for improvement. Even as you master takedowns, seek opportunities to refine and enhance your techniques. Learn from experiences in matches, analyze successes and failures, and continually strive for improvement.
In conclusion, the path to becoming a master at takedowns involves a thoughtful and focused progression. Identify, study, and practice a select few moves until they become ingrained in your wrestling DNA. Embrace the philosophy of depth over breadth, and remember that the journey to mastery is continuous and dynamic. By following this guide, you’ll be well on your way to establishing a formidable reputation on the mat with your signature takedowns.
Building Blocks of Takedowns: Mastering Setups, Head Control, and Angles
Before a wrestler can excel at executing takedowns on opponents, they must first master the fundamental building blocks that pave the way for success. The journey to becoming a proficient takedown artist involves honing skills such as setups, head control, wrist control, and the art of creating angles – essential components that lay the foundation for a formidable offensive game.
Setups
Setups are the precursors to successful takedowns. Wrestlers must develop a diverse arsenal of setups to keep opponents guessing and off-balance. These can include feints, level changes, and deceptive footwork. A well-executed setup not only creates openings but also disrupts the opponent’s defensive stance, making them vulnerable to takedown attempts.
Head Control
Moving and controlling the opponent’s head is a key element in setting up takedowns. Techniques like collar ties and hand fighting help wrestlers dictate head positioning, disrupting their opponent’s balance, limiting visibility, and making them susceptible to takedowns.
Wrist Control
Wrist control is a subtle yet powerful tool. Managing an opponent’s wrists not only limits their defensive capabilities but also provides openings for redirection and attacks. Effective wrist control enhances a wrestler’s offensive options and disrupts the opponent’s game plan.
Moving an Opponent and Off-Balancing
Mastery of movement and off-balancing is crucial for successful takedowns. Techniques such as pulls, drags, and level changes are used to disrupt an opponent’s stability, creating openings for attacks. Off-balancing sets the stage for quick and effective takedowns.
Creating Angles
Creating angles is a sophisticated aspect of setup strategy. By maneuvering around an opponent and changing attack angles, a wrestler can exploit defensive weaknesses. Pivoting, circling, and changing directions keep opponents guessing and set the stage for successful takedowns.
In the journey to becoming a skilled takedown artist, these foundational skills are as vital as the takedowns themselves. Wrestlers should see setups, head control, wrist control, and creating angles as interconnected elements that contribute to overall versatility on the mat. Recognizing these fundamental building blocks is key to developing a holistic and effective approach to offensive wrestling.
Practice a Takedown 10,000 Times
Mastering Takedowns in Wrestling: The Power of Repetition
In the world of wrestling, the idea that “I fear not the wrestler who has practiced 10,000 takedowns once, but I fear the one who has practiced one takedown 10,000 times” resonates deeply. This concept emphasizes the importance of dedicated repetition in mastering a specific takedown, and its relevance is evident in several aspects of wrestling:
Depth of Understanding
Focusing on a single takedown allows wrestlers to delve deep into its nuances. Understanding the mechanics, timing, and subtleties becomes second nature through repeated practice, fostering a profound level of understanding.
Muscle Memory and Precision
Repetition cultivates muscle memory. Executing the same takedown thousands of times hones the body’s response, enhancing speed, accuracy, and efficiency. This muscle memory ensures precise execution during the intensity of a match.
Adaptability in Matches
Mastery of a specific takedown promotes adaptability. Wrestlers become skilled at recognizing opportunities for the chosen move in diverse situations, allowing them to seamlessly integrate it into their overall strategy.
Confidence and Mental Toughness
Repetitive practice breeds confidence. Wrestlers who have perfected a specific takedown approach matches with mental toughness and familiarity. This confidence can be a psychological advantage, influencing the wrestler’s mindset and their opponent’s perception.
Strategic Advantage
Mastery of one takedown doesn’t mean a lack of versatility; it provides a strategic advantage. Wrestlers surprise opponents with the speed, precision, and unexpectedness of their attacks, showcasing the power of a focused approach.
Efficiency in Training
Focused repetition is an efficient training method. Instead of spreading efforts across multiple techniques, wrestlers optimize training time by honing in on a single takedown. This efficiency accelerates the learning curve and facilitates quicker improvement.
In the pursuit of wrestling excellence, the principle of mastering one takedown through relentless repetition stands as a guiding principle. Through this focused approach, wrestlers cultivate expertise that extends beyond technical proficiency, embracing muscle memory, adaptability, confidence, and a strategic edge in competition. In wrestling, it’s not about the quantity of techniques but the depth of mastery achieved through dedicated practice.

Are you looking to dominate your opponents in freestyle wrestling matches? Whether you are a beginner or an experienced wrestler, having effective strategies can make all the difference in securing a victory. In this article, we will explore various techniques and tactics that can help you improve your performance on the mat. From mastering takedowns to perfecting escapes, we will provide you with valuable insights and tips to enhance your freestyle wrestling skills. Get ready to take your wrestling game to the next level with these powerful strategies.
Understanding the Rules and Scoring System
Familiarizing yourself with the rules of freestyle wrestling
Before stepping onto the wrestling mat, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of the rules that govern freestyle wrestling. Familiarizing yourself with these rules will not only ensure that you compete within the boundaries of the sport but also give you an edge over your opponents.
In freestyle wrestling, the objective is to defeat your opponent by scoring more points or pinning them to the mat. The match consists of two three-minute periods, with a 30-second break in between. During the match, wrestlers engage in various techniques to gain control and score points.
Understanding the scoring system and how points are awarded
In freestyle wrestling, points are awarded based on specific actions and techniques executed during the match. It is crucial to understand how these points are awarded to effectively strategize and score against your opponent.
Here are the main ways points are awarded:
Takedown: A takedown is one of the fundamental techniques in freestyle wrestling. It involves gaining control over your opponent and taking them down to the mat while maintaining control. A successful takedown awards two points.
Escape: An escape is when a wrestler successfully breaks free from their opponent’s control while standing or on the mat. It awards one point.
Exposure: Exposure refers to exposing your opponent’s back or shoulders to the mat at an angle of less than 90 degrees. This technique leads to potential pinning situations and awards two or four points, depending on the duration of exposure.
Reversal: A reversal occurs when a wrestler, who is in the bottom position, manages to gain control over their opponent. It awards two points.
Penalty points: Penalty points may be awarded to the opponent for various rule violations, such as illegal holds or actions. These points are awarded to the opposing wrestler.
Understanding how each action contributes to the scoring system allows you to strategize and make calculated moves during the match.
Knowing the importance of takedowns, escapes, and exposures
Mastering the importance of takedowns, escapes, and exposures in freestyle wrestling can significantly impact your chances of winning matches. Each of these techniques plays a crucial role in scoring points and gaining control over your opponent.
Takedowns are essential in establishing dominance and control in a match. Executing successful takedowns not only grants you points but also puts your opponent on the defensive. It allows you to dictate the pace of the match and potentially open opportunities for further scoring.
Escapes are equally important, as they allow you to break free from your opponent’s control and regain a neutral standing position. By earning escape points, you can turn the tables and regain control of the match, putting yourself in a favorable position to score further.
Exposures are particularly significant, as they can lead to potential pinning situations. The longer you can expose your opponent’s back or shoulders to the mat, the higher the scoring potential. Mastering techniques that create exposures can provide you with an advantage, increasing your chances of securing a pinfall victory.
In conclusion, understanding the rules and scoring system of freestyle wrestling is vital for any wrestler aiming to win matches. By familiarizing yourself with the rules, comprehending how points are awarded, and recognizing the importance of takedowns, escapes, and exposures, you can develop effective strategies to outperform your opponents and achieve success in freestyle wrestling.
Developing Technical Skills
When it comes to freestyle wrestling, having strong technical skills is crucial for success on the mat. Developing these skills requires a combination of practice, dedication, and a solid understanding of the fundamental techniques. In this section, we will discuss three key areas to focus on when developing your technical skills.
Mastering basic wrestling techniques such as stance, footwork, and grips
To become a proficient freestyle wrestler, it is essential to master the basic wrestling techniques. This starts with developing a strong and balanced stance, which allows you to maintain control and move efficiently during a match. Your stance should be low, with your knees slightly bent and your weight evenly distributed.
Footwork is another fundamental aspect of wrestling that should not be overlooked. Proper footwork enables you to quickly change direction, maintain balance, and execute various moves effectively. Practice different footwork drills, such as shuffling, circling, and level changes, to improve your agility and speed on the mat.
In addition to stance and footwork, understanding and utilizing effective grips is essential in freestyle wrestling. Learning how to control your opponent’s wrists, head, and body can give you a significant advantage during a match. Experiment with different hand positions and grips, such as the collar tie, underhook, and overhook, to find what works best for your style of wrestling.
Learning effective takedown techniques like single-leg and double-leg takedowns
Takedowns play a crucial role in freestyle wrestling, as they allow you to score points by bringing your opponent to the mat. Two common takedown techniques that every wrestler should master are the single-leg and double-leg takedowns.
The single-leg takedown involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs and driving through to bring them down. This technique is effective for both offensive and defensive purposes. Practice shooting in quickly, securing the leg, and driving through your opponent to execute a successful single-leg takedown.
Similarly, the double-leg takedown focuses on attacking both of your opponent’s legs simultaneously. This move requires explosive power and proper timing. Work on your setups, level changes, and penetration steps to effectively execute a double-leg takedown.
Practicing defensive moves and counterattacks to prevent your opponent’s attacks
While mastering offensive techniques is crucial, it is equally important to develop defensive skills and counterattacks. Being able to prevent your opponent’s attacks can save you from giving up points and put you in a favorable position to score yourself.
Practicing defensive moves such as sprawls and front headlocks can help you evade your opponent’s takedown attempts. A sprawl involves quickly sprawling your legs back and dropping your hips to defend against a shot. Front headlocks, on the other hand, allow you to control your opponent’s head and arm, preventing them from executing a successful takedown.
In addition to defensive moves, mastering counterattacks can be a game-changer in freestyle wrestling. When your opponent initiates an attack, you can seize the opportunity to counter and score points. Techniques like the re-shot, cement mixer, and lateral drop can be effective counterattacks when executed with precision and timing.
By focusing on developing your technical skills through mastering basic techniques, learning effective takedowns, and practicing defensive moves and counterattacks, you can enhance your chances of winning freestyle wrestling matches. Remember, consistent practice and dedication are key to becoming a skilled freestyle wrestler.
Building Strength and Conditioning
Implementing a comprehensive strength training program
To excel in freestyle wrestling, it is crucial to have a solid foundation of strength. Implementing a comprehensive strength training program is essential for wrestlers looking to enhance their performance on the mat. This program should focus on targeting all major muscle groups to ensure overall strength and stability.
One effective strategy is to incorporate compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses into your training routine. These exercises engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously, allowing you to build functional strength and power. It is important to progressively increase the weight and intensity of these exercises over time to continue challenging your muscles and promoting growth.
Additionally, incorporating exercises that target specific wrestling movements can greatly improve your overall performance. For example, practicing explosive movements like Olympic lifts, plyometrics, and medicine ball throws can help develop the explosiveness needed for takedowns and escapes during matches. These exercises not only enhance your strength but also improve your agility and coordination, which are vital in freestyle wrestling.
Incorporating functional exercises to improve wrestling-specific movements
Freestyle wrestling requires a unique set of movements that demand functional strength and flexibility. To improve wrestling-specific movements, it is important to incorporate functional exercises into your training regimen.
Exercises such as Turkish get-ups, Bulgarian split squats, and single-leg deadlifts can help develop stability, balance, and flexibility in the muscles and joints used during wrestling maneuvers. These exercises mimic the demands placed on the body during matches, allowing you to adapt and perform more effectively on the mat.
Furthermore, incorporating core exercises like planks, Russian twists, and hanging leg raises can greatly enhance your overall stability and control. A strong core not only improves your balance and posture but also allows for more explosive movements during takedowns and reversals.
Focusing on cardiovascular endurance and agility through drills and conditioning
In addition to strength training, it is crucial for wrestlers to focus on cardiovascular endurance and agility. Freestyle wrestling involves constant movement and intense bursts of energy, making cardiovascular fitness a key component of success.
Incorporating high-intensity interval training (HIIT) into your conditioning routine can greatly improve your cardiovascular endurance. This involves alternating between short bursts of intense exercise and periods of rest or low-intensity activity. Examples of HIIT exercises for wrestlers include sprints, burpees, and mountain climbers. These exercises not only improve your cardiovascular fitness but also mimic the fast-paced nature of wrestling matches.
Agility drills are also essential for wrestlers looking to improve their quickness and reaction time. Incorporating ladder drills, cone drills, and agility ladder exercises into your training routine can enhance your footwork and movement efficiency, allowing you to quickly change directions and evade opponents’ attacks.
By focusing on building strength, incorporating functional exercises, and prioritizing cardiovascular endurance and agility, wrestlers can develop a well-rounded conditioning program that will significantly improve their performance in freestyle wrestling matches. Remember to consult with a qualified coach or trainer to tailor these strategies to your individual needs and goals.
Strategizing and Analyzing Opponents
Studying your opponents’ strengths and weaknesses
One of the most crucial aspects of winning freestyle wrestling matches is studying and analyzing your opponents’ strengths and weaknesses. By understanding their capabilities, you can develop effective strategies to counter their moves and gain an advantage during the match.
To study your opponents, it is essential to watch their previous matches and analyze their techniques. Observe their preferred moves, positions, and takedown attempts. Pay attention to their agility, speed, and overall wrestling style. By doing so, you can identify areas where they excel and areas where they may be vulnerable.
Additionally, studying your opponents’ weaknesses is equally important. Look for patterns in their matches where they may struggle or make mistakes. Identify any weaknesses in their defense, takedown defense, or specific techniques. By pinpointing these vulnerabilities, you can develop a game plan that exploits their weaknesses and maximizes your chances of success.
Developing a game plan based on your own strengths and their vulnerabilities
Once you have studied your opponents’ strengths and weaknesses, it is crucial to develop a game plan that capitalizes on your own strengths while targeting their vulnerabilities. Take into consideration your own wrestling style, techniques, and strengths when formulating your strategy.
If you possess excellent takedown skills, for example, focus on exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses in takedown defense. If you have superior agility or flexibility, consider using quick movements or escapes to your advantage. By leveraging your own strengths, you can put pressure on your opponent and dictate the pace of the match.
Simultaneously, tailor your game plan to exploit your opponent’s vulnerabilities. If they struggle with defending against certain grappling techniques, concentrate on executing those moves. If they tend to tire quickly, aim to maintain a high pace throughout the match to exhaust them. By targeting their weaknesses, you can create opportunities for scoring points and ultimately winning the match.
Adapting your strategy during the match based on your opponent’s actions
While having a well-thought-out game plan is essential, it is equally crucial to be adaptable and flexible during the match. As your opponent may also have their own strategy, it is essential to observe and analyze their actions to make real-time adjustments.
Pay attention to how your opponent reacts to your initial moves and adjust your strategy accordingly. If they have a strong defense against your preferred techniques, be prepared to switch to alternative moves or approaches. Observe any changes in their wrestling style, body language, or fatigue levels, as these can provide valuable insights into their mindset and potential weaknesses.
Being adaptable during the match allows you to stay one step ahead of your opponent and make strategic decisions that increase your chances of success. By analyzing their actions and adjusting your strategy accordingly, you can seize opportunities and outmaneuver your opponent to secure victory.
Remember, strategizing and analyzing your opponents is an ongoing process. Continuously stay updated on your opponents’ recent performances and adapt your strategy accordingly. By combining thorough analysis, a well-crafted game plan, and adaptability, you can increase your chances of winning freestyle wrestling matches.
Mental Preparation and Focus
Building mental toughness and resilience
Mental toughness and resilience play a crucial role in achieving success in freestyle wrestling matches. It is important to develop these qualities to withstand the physical and mental challenges that come with the sport. Here are some strategies to help build mental toughness and resilience:
Embrace adversity: Rather than shying away from challenges, embrace them as opportunities for growth. By facing and overcoming tough situations, you build mental strength and resilience.
Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals helps you stay motivated and focused. Break down your ultimate objective into smaller milestones and celebrate each achievement along the way. This will enhance your mental toughness and resilience, as you see progress and stay committed to your goals.
Maintain a positive mindset: Adopting a positive mindset is key to building mental toughness. Focus on the things you can control, such as your effort and attitude, and let go of factors beyond your control. This will help you stay resilient and maintain a strong mental state, even when faced with setbacks.
Practicing visualization and positive self-talk
Visualization and positive self-talk are powerful techniques for enhancing mental preparation and focus in freestyle wrestling matches. By incorporating these practices into your training routine, you can improve your performance and increase your chances of winning. Here’s how to effectively practice visualization and positive self-talk:
Visualize success: Before a match, close your eyes and vividly imagine yourself executing flawless techniques, dominating your opponent, and ultimately winning the match. Visualizing success enhances your mental preparation and boosts your confidence.
Use positive affirmations: Develop a set of positive affirmations that you can repeat to yourself before and during matches. These affirmations should focus on your strengths, skills, and abilities. By reinforcing positive thoughts, you can build mental resilience and maintain a strong focus on your performance.
Create mental rehearsal scenarios: Visualize different scenarios that may occur during a match, such as being behind in points or facing a challenging opponent. Practice mentally overcoming these obstacles and strategize how you will respond in each situation. This mental rehearsal will help you feel more prepared and confident when faced with real-life challenges.
Maintaining focus and concentration throughout the match
Maintaining focus and concentration throughout a freestyle wrestling match is crucial for staying in control and making quick, strategic decisions. Here are some strategies to help you stay focused and concentrated during the match:
Develop a pre-match routine: Establish a pre-match routine that includes mental preparation techniques such as deep breathing exercises or visualization. This routine will help you enter a focused state of mind and prepare you for the challenges ahead.
Control your breathing: Deep breathing exercises can help calm your mind and enhance your focus. Practice rhythmic breathing patterns, inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling slowly through your mouth. This will help regulate your heart rate and keep you centered during the match.
Stay present: Avoid getting caught up in past mistakes or worrying about future outcomes. Instead, focus on the present moment, paying attention to your opponent’s movements and reacting accordingly. By staying present, you can make quick, informed decisions and maintain a strong mental focus throughout the match.
Remember, mental preparation and focus are just as important as physical training in freestyle wrestling. By building mental toughness, practicing visualization and positive self-talk, and maintaining focus and concentration, you can maximize your chances of winning matches and achieving your goals.
Training and Conditioning
Implementing a structured training regimen
To excel in freestyle wrestling, it is crucial to have a well-structured training regimen in place. This regimen should focus on improving various aspects of your wrestling skills, including strength, endurance, technique, and mental toughness.
One effective strategy is to divide your training sessions into specific periods or cycles. This allows you to target different areas of improvement and prevent monotony. For example, you could dedicate one cycle to building strength and power through weightlifting exercises, while another cycle could focus on enhancing your agility and flexibility through dynamic drills.
Additionally, it is essential to establish a consistent training schedule and stick to it. Consistency is key in ensuring progress and avoiding burnout. Aim for a balance between intense workouts and sufficient rest and recovery periods to optimize your performance.
Working on improving speed, agility, and explosiveness
Speed, agility, and explosiveness are crucial attributes for success in freestyle wrestling. Incorporating specific exercises to enhance these qualities can significantly improve your overall performance.
To improve speed, incorporate sprint intervals into your training routine. Short, high-intensity bursts of running or wrestling-specific movements will develop your quickness and reaction time on the mat.
Agility drills are also essential for freestyle wrestling. Exercises such as ladder drills, cone drills, and lateral movements can enhance your footwork, coordination, and quick change of direction. These drills simulate the fast-paced nature of wrestling matches and improve your ability to evade opponents’ attacks.
Explosiveness is another vital aspect of freestyle wrestling. Plyometric exercises like box jumps, medicine ball throws, and explosive push-ups can help develop your power and explosiveness. These exercises train your muscles to generate maximum force in a short amount of time, enabling you to execute powerful takedowns and escapes.
Incorporating drills and simulated match scenarios into your training
In addition to physical conditioning, it is essential to incorporate drills and simulated match scenarios into your training. These practice sessions allow you to hone your techniques, improve your decision-making abilities, and develop your wrestling instincts.
Drills that focus on specific techniques, such as takedowns, escapes, and reversals, help refine your execution and timing. Repetition is key in mastering these techniques, so dedicate ample time to drill them with a partner or on a wrestling dummy.
Simulated match scenarios are valuable for replicating the intensity and unpredictability of actual wrestling matches. Spar with training partners of different skill levels, adopt different starting positions, and practice various strategies to enhance your adaptability and problem-solving skills. This type of training prepares you mentally and physically for the challenges you may face during a freestyle wrestling match.
In conclusion, a comprehensive training and conditioning program is vital for success in freestyle wrestling. By implementing a structured regimen, focusing on speed, agility, and explosiveness, and incorporating drills and simulated match scenarios, you can enhance your skills, improve your performance, and increase your chances of winning matches.
In conclusion, mastering the art of freestyle wrestling requires a combination of technical skills, physical strength, mental fortitude, and effective strategies. By focusing on proper technique, understanding the rules and scoring system, and implementing these proven strategies, wrestlers can greatly increase their chances of winning matches. It is important to constantly practice and improve upon these strategies, as well as staying up to date with the latest trends and techniques in the sport. With dedication, perseverance, and a strategic mindset, wrestlers can excel in freestyle wrestling and achieve their goals of victory in the wrestling arena.

Why Takedowns are Important
In the world of folk-style wrestling, mastering takedowns is the key to success on the mat. Understanding why takedowns are crucial can significantly impact a wrestler’s overall performance, setting the stage for victory. A recent junior high wrestling tournament vividly illustrates the pivotal role takedowns play in match outcomes.
Consider this scenario: Many skilled wrestlers found themselves on the losing end of matches by a slim margin of two points or less. Notably, the common factor in many of these matches was a takedown scored in the first period. Coaches often assert, “If you can take anyone down, you will win the match.” Let’s delve into an illustrative example that underscores the significance of this adage.
Example Scenario: Wrestler A vs. Wrestler B
This scenario serves as a poignant reminder that excelling in takedowns can compensate for shortcomings in other facets of wrestling. While it is essential to be well-rounded and proficient in all technical aspects, the ability to secure takedowns lays a solid foundation for success.
In essence, takedowns set the tone for a match, offering wrestlers an opportunity to establish dominance early on. A wrestler who can consistently execute effective takedowns places themselves in a favorable position, both strategically and psychologically. By seizing control of the scoring and dictating the pace, a wrestler with superior takedown skills can secure not just points but, more importantly, a pathway to victory on the wrestling mat.
How to Become a Master at Take Downs
Becoming a Master at Takedowns: A Step-by-Step Guide
Discover Your Signature Moves:
The first crucial step is to identify three takedowns that resonate with you. These should be moves that feel natural and align with your wrestling style. Everyone is different, so it’s essential to choose techniques that complement your strengths and preferences.
Study and Practice:
Once you’ve selected your three favorite takedowns, dive deep into studying them. Analyze the mechanics, timing, and nuances of each move. Dedicate extensive practice time to these takedowns until you can execute them in practice without conscious thought. This repetitive practice builds muscle memory and familiarity.
Application in Matches:
Transition from practice to live matches. Start incorporating your chosen takedowns into your wrestling matches. Pay attention to how well you can execute them under real match conditions. This phase is crucial for refining your technique and adapting the moves to different opponents and scenarios.
Mastered Three? Rinse and Repeat:
Once you’ve achieved a level of mastery with your initial three takedowns, don’t rush to learn new moves. Instead, replicate the process. Identify three more takedowns that complement your existing skill set and repeat the cycle of studying, practicing, and applying them in matches.
Depth, Not Breadth:
The key to becoming a master at takedowns is depth, not breadth. Elite wrestlers often have a handful of go-to moves, their “bread and butter.” Strive to be exceptional at a select few rather than mediocre at many. This focused expertise gives you a distinct advantage on the mat.
Confidence and Consistency:
As you accumulate a repertoire of mastered takedowns, your confidence in matches will soar. The goal is to reach a point where you feel you can take anyone down with your chosen moves consistently. This confidence translates into a mental edge over opponents.
Continuous Improvement:
Wrestling is a dynamic sport, and there’s always room for improvement. Even as you master takedowns, seek opportunities to refine and enhance your techniques. Learn from experiences in matches, analyze successes and failures, and continually strive for improvement.
In conclusion, the path to becoming a master at takedowns involves a thoughtful and focused progression. Identify, study, and practice a select few moves until they become ingrained in your wrestling DNA. Embrace the philosophy of depth over breadth, and remember that the journey to mastery is continuous and dynamic. By following this guide, you’ll be well on your way to establishing a formidable reputation on the mat with your signature takedowns.
Building Blocks of Takedowns: Mastering Setups, Head Control, and Angles
Before a wrestler can excel at executing takedowns on opponents, they must first master the fundamental building blocks that pave the way for success. The journey to becoming a proficient takedown artist involves honing skills such as setups, head control, wrist control, and the art of creating angles – essential components that lay the foundation for a formidable offensive game.
Setups
Setups are the precursors to successful takedowns. Wrestlers must develop a diverse arsenal of setups to keep opponents guessing and off-balance. These can include feints, level changes, and deceptive footwork. A well-executed setup not only creates openings but also disrupts the opponent’s defensive stance, making them vulnerable to takedown attempts.
Head Control
Moving and controlling the opponent’s head is a key element in setting up takedowns. Techniques like collar ties and hand fighting help wrestlers dictate head positioning, disrupting their opponent’s balance, limiting visibility, and making them susceptible to takedowns.
Wrist Control
Wrist control is a subtle yet powerful tool. Managing an opponent’s wrists not only limits their defensive capabilities but also provides openings for redirection and attacks. Effective wrist control enhances a wrestler’s offensive options and disrupts the opponent’s game plan.
Moving an Opponent and Off-Balancing
Mastery of movement and off-balancing is crucial for successful takedowns. Techniques such as pulls, drags, and level changes are used to disrupt an opponent’s stability, creating openings for attacks. Off-balancing sets the stage for quick and effective takedowns.
Creating Angles
Creating angles is a sophisticated aspect of setup strategy. By maneuvering around an opponent and changing attack angles, a wrestler can exploit defensive weaknesses. Pivoting, circling, and changing directions keep opponents guessing and set the stage for successful takedowns.
In the journey to becoming a skilled takedown artist, these foundational skills are as vital as the takedowns themselves. Wrestlers should see setups, head control, wrist control, and creating angles as interconnected elements that contribute to overall versatility on the mat. Recognizing these fundamental building blocks is key to developing a holistic and effective approach to offensive wrestling.
Practice a Takedown 10,000 Times
Mastering Takedowns in Wrestling: The Power of Repetition
In the world of wrestling, the idea that “I fear not the wrestler who has practiced 10,000 takedowns once, but I fear the one who has practiced one takedown 10,000 times” resonates deeply. This concept emphasizes the importance of dedicated repetition in mastering a specific takedown, and its relevance is evident in several aspects of wrestling:
Depth of Understanding
Focusing on a single takedown allows wrestlers to delve deep into its nuances. Understanding the mechanics, timing, and subtleties becomes second nature through repeated practice, fostering a profound level of understanding.
Muscle Memory and Precision
Repetition cultivates muscle memory. Executing the same takedown thousands of times hones the body’s response, enhancing speed, accuracy, and efficiency. This muscle memory ensures precise execution during the intensity of a match.
Adaptability in Matches
Mastery of a specific takedown promotes adaptability. Wrestlers become skilled at recognizing opportunities for the chosen move in diverse situations, allowing them to seamlessly integrate it into their overall strategy.
Confidence and Mental Toughness
Repetitive practice breeds confidence. Wrestlers who have perfected a specific takedown approach matches with mental toughness and familiarity. This confidence can be a psychological advantage, influencing the wrestler’s mindset and their opponent’s perception.
Strategic Advantage
Mastery of one takedown doesn’t mean a lack of versatility; it provides a strategic advantage. Wrestlers surprise opponents with the speed, precision, and unexpectedness of their attacks, showcasing the power of a focused approach.
Efficiency in Training
Focused repetition is an efficient training method. Instead of spreading efforts across multiple techniques, wrestlers optimize training time by honing in on a single takedown. This efficiency accelerates the learning curve and facilitates quicker improvement.
In the pursuit of wrestling excellence, the principle of mastering one takedown through relentless repetition stands as a guiding principle. Through this focused approach, wrestlers cultivate expertise that extends beyond technical proficiency, embracing muscle memory, adaptability, confidence, and a strategic edge in competition. In wrestling, it’s not about the quantity of techniques but the depth of mastery achieved through dedicated practice.

Wrestling. It's not just a sport; it's a battle of wits, strength, and strategy. To excel, you need takedowns that strike fear into your opponents. But how can you achieve that elusive takedown power? Let's unravel the puzzle.
Strength is the Foundation: The starting point is building your body into a powerhouse. Imagine your legs as mighty pistons driving you forward. Squats, lunges, deadlifts – they're your secret weapons. Strengthen your legs, and you'll gain the explosive power needed for those lightning-quick takedowns.
Technique, the Artistry: Takedowns aren't just about raw strength; they're a choreography of moves and counter-moves. You must be the choreographer of your success. Master the art of setups, angles, and timing. A perfectly executed takedown is poetry in motion.
The Vice-Grip: Grip strength is your lifeline in wrestling. It's your connection to your opponent, your control over the match. Grip training exercises like farmer's walks and grip squeezes are your allies. Develop that vice-like grip, and you'll be the puppeteer in the ring.
Core of Steel: Your core isn't just for aesthetics; it's your stabilizer. Imagine it as the anchor holding you firm when you're driving for a takedown. Planks, Russian twists, medicine ball throws – these are your tools for forging a core of steel.
The Mind's Eye: Wrestling is as much a mental game as it is physical. Visualize success. Close your eyes and see yourself executing flawless takedowns. Visualization sharpens your mental focus and boosts your confidence.
Repetition and Precision: There's no substitute for practice. Drills, drills, and more drills. Partner up, simulate real match situations, and repeat until it's etched in your muscle memory. Precision is born from repetition.
In the quest to improve your takedown power, it's not a single puzzle piece but a mosaic of elements. Each one contributes to the bigger picture. Strength, technique, grip, core, mindset, and practice – they're your brushes, and the mat is your canvas.
In wrestling, your takedowns are your signature strokes, and with dedication, you can turn them into masterpieces. The road might be perplexing at times, but remember, it's the burst of energy and creativity in your journey that sets you apart. So, embrace the challenge, and let your takedown power reign supreme on the mat.

Mastering the Art of Takedowns in Freestyle Wrestling: A Comprehensive Guide
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling. If you are passionate about this dynamic combat sport and want to enhance your skills in taking down opponents, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we will delve into the essential techniques, strategies, and training drills that will empower you to dominate your opponents on the wrestling mat. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your takedown abilities, this guide is designed to provide you with valuable insights and expert advice to take your freestyle wrestling game to the next level.
Understanding the Basics of Takedowns
Takedowns are a fundamental aspect of freestyle wrestling. They involve swiftly and strategically taking down your opponent to gain control or score points. Understanding the basics of takedowns is crucial for any wrestler looking to excel in this dynamic sport.
Different Types of Takedowns
Single Leg Takedown: This is one of the most common takedown techniques used in freestyle wrestling. It involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs and swiftly driving them off balance to bring them down to the mat.
Double Leg Takedown: Similar to the single leg takedown, the double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent’s legs and using your body weight to knock them off balance and bring them down.
High Crotch Takedown: This takedown technique requires you to shoot in towards your opponent’s legs, driving your shoulder into their midsection. From there, you can lift and maneuver them to the ground.
Fireman’s Carry: The fireman’s carry is a more advanced takedown that involves throwing your opponent over your shoulder while maintaining control of their upper body. It requires good timing and technique but can be highly effective when executed correctly.
Strategies for Setting up Takedowns
Establishing Control: Before attempting a takedown, it’s essential to establish control over your opponent. This can be achieved through hand fighting, maintaining good posture, and creating angles to disrupt their balance.
Creating Openings: Look for opportunities to create openings for takedowns by feinting or faking attacks. This can force your opponent to react, opening up opportunities for you to execute a takedown.
Using Combinations: Utilize combinations of attacks to keep your opponent guessing and off balance. By chaining together different takedown attempts, you can increase your chances of successfully executing a takedown.
Key Techniques for Executing Takedowns
Level Change: A crucial aspect of executing a successful takedown is the ability to change levels. This involves lowering your body position while maintaining good posture, making it harder for your opponent to defend against your takedown attempts.
Explosiveness and Speed: Takedowns require explosive and quick movements. By training your explosiveness and speed through drills and exercises, you can enhance your ability to execute takedowns effectively.
Maintaining Balance: It’s important to maintain your own balance throughout the takedown process. This allows you to stay in control and quickly transition to other techniques if necessary.
Finishing the Takedown: Once you have initiated a takedown, focus on finishing it strong. This involves driving through your opponent, using your entire body to maintain control, and securing a dominant position on the mat.
Mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling takes time, practice, and a deep understanding of the basics. By familiarizing yourself with different types of takedowns, employing effective strategies, and honing key techniques, you can elevate your takedown game and become a formidable force on the wrestling mat.
Developing Strength and Conditioning
In order to excel in freestyle wrestling and master the art of takedowns, it is crucial to focus on developing strength and conditioning. This aspect of training plays a vital role in enhancing performance on the mat. By incorporating specific exercises for building core strength, cardiovascular training for endurance, and emphasizing the importance of flexibility and agility, wrestlers can greatly improve their overall abilities.
Specific Exercises for Building Core Strength
Core strength is fundamental in freestyle wrestling as it provides stability and power for executing takedowns effectively. Incorporating specific exercises targeting the core muscles can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. Some effective exercises for building core strength include:
Plank: The plank is a simple yet highly effective exercise for strengthening the core. Start by assuming a push-up position and then lower your forearms to the ground. Hold this position while maintaining a straight line from your head to your feet. Aim to gradually increase the duration of the hold as your core strength improves.
Russian Twists: This exercise targets the oblique muscles, which are crucial for generating rotational power during takedowns. Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly, keeping your back straight. Hold a weight or medicine ball in front of your chest and twist your torso from side to side, touching the weight or ball to the ground on each side.
Leg Raises: Leg raises help strengthen the lower abdominal muscles, which are essential for explosive movements in wrestling. Lie on your back with your legs straight and your hands by your sides. Lift your legs off the ground while keeping them straight, and then slowly lower them back down without touching the ground. Repeat for multiple sets.
Cardiovascular Training for Endurance
Endurance is another crucial aspect of freestyle wrestling, as matches can be physically demanding and often require sustained effort. Incorporating cardiovascular training into your routine can greatly improve your endurance levels. Here are some effective cardiovascular exercises for wrestlers:
Running: Running is a great cardiovascular exercise that helps build endurance and stamina. Incorporate both steady-state running for longer durations and interval training to simulate the intensity of wrestling matches. Interval training involves alternating between high-intensity sprints and recovery periods.
Cycling: Cycling is a low-impact cardiovascular exercise that can be beneficial for wrestlers. Whether you prefer indoor cycling or hitting the roads, it provides an excellent way to improve your endurance. Vary the intensity of your rides by incorporating intervals or incorporating hill climbs to simulate the demands of wrestling.
Jumping Rope: Jumping rope is not only a great warm-up exercise but also an effective way to improve cardiovascular fitness. It is a high-intensity exercise that engages multiple muscle groups and helps improve coordination and footwork.
Importance of Flexibility and Agility
Flexibility and agility are key components of successful takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Being able to move swiftly and fluidly while maintaining balance is crucial for executing techniques effectively. Here are some important aspects to consider:
Dynamic Stretching: Incorporate dynamic stretching exercises into your warm-up routine before training or competing. Dynamic stretching involves continuous movement through a full range of motion and helps improve flexibility and joint mobility. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, and torso twists.
Plyometric Exercises: Plyometric exercises, such as box jumps or lateral bounds, help improve agility and explosive power. These exercises involve quick and powerful movements that enhance muscle elasticity and coordination.
Yoga or Pilates: Engaging in regular yoga or Pilates sessions can greatly improve flexibility, balance, and body control. These practices also promote core strength and stability, which are essential for executing takedowns with precision.
By incorporating these exercises and emphasizing the importance of strength and conditioning, core strength, cardiovascular training, flexibility, and agility, wrestlers can enhance their performance in freestyle wrestling and ultimately master the art of takedowns. Remember, consistent practice and dedication are key to achieving success in any sport.
Mastering the Mechanics of Takedowns
Proper Stance and Balance
In the world of freestyle wrestling, having a proper stance and balance is crucial to mastering the art of takedowns. Your stance determines your readiness and stability while engaging with your opponent. Here are some key points to remember:
Gripping and Controlling Techniques
Once you have established a solid stance, the gripping and controlling techniques play a vital role in executing successful takedowns. Here’s what you need to know:
Footwork and Timing
Apart from having a strong stance and effective gripping techniques, footwork and timing are essential components of mastering takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Consider the following factors:
By understanding and practicing the mechanics of takedowns, focusing on proper stance and balance, gripping and controlling techniques, as well as footwork and timing, you can elevate your freestyle wrestling skills to new heights. Mastering these fundamental aspects will greatly enhance your ability to execute effective takedowns and gain a competitive edge in the sport.
Countering and Defending Against Takedowns
Recognizing and Reacting to Opponent’s Attacks
In freestyle wrestling, the ability to recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks is crucial when countering and defending against takedowns. Being able to anticipate your opponent’s movements and understand their preferred techniques will give you a significant advantage in defending against their attacks.
To effectively recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks, it is essential to develop a keen sense of observation. Pay close attention to their footwork, body positioning, and any subtle cues that may indicate an impending takedown attempt. By studying your opponent’s patterns and tendencies, you can better prepare yourself to counter their attacks.
Quick reflexes and agility are key when reacting to your opponent’s attacks. As soon as you perceive an incoming takedown attempt, you must swiftly adjust your stance and position yourself to neutralize their attack. Maintaining a low center of gravity and keeping your balance will make it harder for your opponent to execute a successful takedown.
Effective Counter Techniques
Having a repertoire of effective counter techniques will greatly enhance your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are a few techniques that can be utilized to counter your opponent’s attacks:
Sprawl: The sprawl technique involves quickly extending your legs backward while dropping your hips to the mat. By doing so, you create a wider base and make it difficult for your opponent to secure a takedown.
Whizzer: The whizzer, also known as an overhook, is a defensive move where you use your arm to control your opponent’s attacking arm. This technique allows you to redirect their momentum and potentially gain an advantageous position.
Front Headlock: When your opponent attempts a takedown, you can react by securing a front headlock. This move involves wrapping your arms around your opponent’s head and controlling their upper body, preventing them from completing the takedown.
Granby Roll: The granby roll is an effective technique to counter a takedown and quickly regain control. It involves rolling away from your opponent’s attack while using your momentum to reverse the situation.
Defensive Strategies and Tactics
In addition to individual counter techniques, implementing defensive strategies and tactics can greatly improve your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are some defensive strategies to consider:
Maintain a Strong Base: By keeping a strong and balanced stance, you make it more challenging for your opponent to take you down. Focus on keeping your feet shoulder-width apart and distributing your weight evenly.
Hand Fighting: Engaging in hand fighting with your opponent can disrupt their attempts to initiate takedowns. By controlling their hands and wrists, you limit their ability to secure a successful takedown.
Circle and Angle: Instead of standing directly in front of your opponent, use circular footwork and angles to make it harder for them to shoot for a takedown. Constantly moving and changing angles forces your opponent to adjust and can create openings for counters.
Utilize Defensive Drills: Incorporate defensive drills into your training routine to improve your reflexes, timing, and defensive instincts. Practice scenarios where your opponent attempts takedowns, and focus on reacting quickly and effectively countering their attacks.
By recognizing and reacting to your opponent’s attacks, utilizing effective counter techniques, and implementing defensive strategies, you will enhance your ability to counter and defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Constant practice and refinement of these skills will lead to mastery and success on the wrestling mat.
Strategies for Competition
Creating an Effective Game Plan
Having a well-defined game plan is crucial in freestyle wrestling competitions. It allows wrestlers to approach matches with a strategic mindset, maximizing their chances of success. Here are some key steps to creating an effective game plan:
Study your opponent: Before the match, research and analyze your opponent’s previous performances. Look for patterns, strengths, and weaknesses that can be exploited during the bout. This information will help you develop a targeted strategy.
Identify your strengths: Assess your own wrestling style and identify your strongest techniques and moves. Build your game plan around these strengths to capitalize on your skills during the match.
Set specific objectives: Determine specific goals and objectives for the match. These could include scoring a certain number of takedowns, avoiding specific moves from your opponent, or dominating a particular position. Having clear objectives will keep you focused and motivated during the competition.
Practice your strategy: Once you have identified your game plan, practice it extensively during training sessions. Work on executing your chosen techniques and movements flawlessly to build muscle memory and confidence.
Analyzing and Exploiting Opponent’s Weaknesses
One of the most effective strategies in freestyle wrestling is identifying and exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses. By studying their previous matches and observing their style, you can develop a game plan that targets their vulnerabilities. Here’s how to go about it:
Watch their matches: Analyze your opponent’s previous matches to identify any recurring weaknesses or areas where they struggle. Pay attention to their reactions in different situations and take note of any recurring mistakes they make.
Identify common weaknesses: Once you have observed your opponent’s matches, look for common weaknesses that can be exploited. These could be technical flaws, predictable reactions, or vulnerabilities in certain positions. Understanding these weaknesses will help you plan your attacks accordingly.
Develop counter strategies: Based on the weaknesses you have identified, develop specific counter strategies. Practice techniques and moves that directly exploit your opponent’s vulnerabilities, allowing you to gain an advantage during the match.
Stay adaptable: While it is important to exploit your opponent’s weaknesses, it is equally crucial to adapt your strategy during the match. If your initial plan doesn’t yield the desired results, be prepared to make quick adjustments and capitalize on any new openings that arise.
Mental Preparation for Matches
Mental preparation plays a vital role in freestyle wrestling competitions. It helps wrestlers stay focused, confident, and resilient throughout the match. Here are some key aspects of mental preparation that can enhance your performance:
Visualization techniques: Before the match, spend time visualizing yourself executing your game plan flawlessly. Imagine each move, takedown, and counter in vivid detail. This mental rehearsal helps build confidence and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenges.
Positive self-talk: Replace negative thoughts and self-doubt with positive affirmations. Remind yourself of your strengths, skills, and previous successes. Repeat empowering phrases to boost your confidence and maintain a positive mindset.
Controlled breathing: Deep, controlled breathing techniques can help calm your nerves and reduce anxiety before and during the match. Practice rhythmic breathing exercises to center yourself and stay focused on the present moment.
Develop a pre-match routine: Establish a consistent pre-match routine that helps you get in the right mindset. This routine could include warm-up exercises, visualization sessions, or listening to motivational music. Having a routine creates a sense of familiarity and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenge.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of physical prowess and mental acuity. By strategizing effectively, exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses, and mentally preparing for matches, you can significantly enhance your performance on the mat.
Drills and Training Exercises
Partner Drills for Takedown Practice
One of the most effective ways to improve your takedown skills in freestyle wrestling is through partner drills. These drills allow you to practice your techniques in a controlled setting with a training partner. Here are some partner drills that can help you master the art of takedowns:
Double Leg Takedown Drill: Start by facing your partner in a wrestling stance. Initiate the drill by shooting in for a double leg takedown. Your partner should sprawl and defend while you focus on driving through and completing the takedown. Repeat this drill multiple times, alternating roles with your partner.
Single Leg Takedown Drill: Similar to the double leg takedown drill, this drill focuses on executing a single leg takedown. Begin by gripping your partner’s collar tie or wrist control, then quickly transition to a single leg attack. Your partner should defend by sprawling and countering. Practice this drill with both partners taking turns as the attacker and defender.
Hand Fighting Drill: Hand fighting is crucial for setting up takedowns and gaining control over your opponent. In this drill, focus on developing your hand fighting skills by engaging in controlled sparring with your partner. Work on establishing dominant grips, clearing ties, and creating openings for takedowns. Remember to maintain proper technique and intensity throughout the drill.
Solo Drills for Technique Refinement
In addition to partner drills, solo drills are essential for refining your takedown techniques and improving your overall performance in freestyle wrestling. These drills allow you to focus on specific movements and body mechanics without the need for a training partner. Here are some solo drills that can help you enhance your takedown skills:
Shadow Wrestling: Shadow wrestling involves simulating takedowns and defensive movements without a partner. Stand in front of a mirror or an imaginary opponent and practice your takedown techniques. Focus on proper footwork, hip movement, and penetration steps. Visualize your opponent’s reactions and work on your timing and precision.
Shot Drills: Shot drills are designed to improve your speed, explosiveness, and precision when shooting for takedowns. Set up a series of cones or markers on the ground, and practice shooting from various distances. Start slowly, focusing on proper form, and gradually increase your speed and intensity. Challenge yourself by incorporating level changes and fakes into your shots.
Resistance Band Drills: Resistance bands can be a valuable tool for developing strength and power in your takedown movements. Attach a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point and work on your takedown motions against the resistance. This will help you build explosive power and improve your ability to finish takedowns against tough opponents.
Live Wrestling and Scrimmage Sessions
While drills and solo exercises are essential for skill development, nothing can replicate the intensity and unpredictability of live wrestling. Engaging in live wrestling sessions and scrimmages is crucial for applying your techniques in real-time situations. Here are some tips for making the most of live wrestling sessions:
Focus on Applying Techniques: Use live wrestling sessions as an opportunity to practice the takedowns you’ve been drilling. Focus on executing your techniques against resisting opponents and adapting to their reactions. Pay attention to your positioning, timing, and setups during live situations.
Experiment and Learn: Live wrestling sessions provide a platform for experimentation and learning. Don’t be afraid to try new techniques or variations of existing ones. Take risks, analyze the outcomes, and learn from both successful and unsuccessful attempts. This will help you expand your arsenal of takedowns and develop a well-rounded skillset.
Seek Feedback and Spar with Different Partners: During live wrestling sessions, actively seek feedback from coaches, teammates, or more experienced wrestlers. They can provide valuable insights into your takedown techniques, positioning, and overall performance. Additionally, try to wrestle with a variety of partners to expose yourself to different styles and challenges.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires consistent practice, dedication, and a willingness to learn from both successes and failures. By incorporating partner drills, solo exercises, and live wrestling sessions into your training routine, you can significantly improve your takedown skills and become a formidable competitor in the sport.
In conclusion, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of technique, strength, and strategy. It is essential to understand the fundamentals of positioning, footwork, and timing to successfully execute takedowns. Additionally, building strength and endurance through regular training and conditioning is crucial for maintaining control and overpowering opponents. Moreover, having a strategic approach, such as setting up takedowns with feints or capitalizing on an opponent’s weaknesses, can greatly increase the chances of success. By continuously honing these skills and incorporating them into one’s training regimen, wrestlers can elevate their performance and become formidable competitors in the sport of freestyle wrestling.

Strong style wrestling emphasizes realistic strikes and intense submission holds. Hand fighting in strong style involves controlling the opponent's arms to set up strikes and submission attempts. Wrestlers in strong style use hand fighting techniques to create opportunities for powerful strikes and impactful maneuvers, making the matches feel authentic and hard-hitting.

Luchador wrestling is known for its high-flying acrobatics and fast-paced maneuvers. Hand fighting is crucial in luchador wrestling to establish wrist control and set up dynamic aerial assaults.

In amateur mat wrestling, the double-leg takedown is typically the first takedown taught to wrestlers. Executed properly, it can be an effective way of getting your opponent onto the mat. In mixed martial arts, it's a more complicated maneuver, somewhat less reliable because of the complexities of strikes and guards available, though it's still a commonly used takedown, especially from mat specialists.

Learning the Double Leg Takedown Wrestling Move
This common technique can help you get your opponent to the mat and score two points.
When you need points, you’re going to want the right offensive techniques in your arsenal. One of the first takedowns wrestlers learn is the double leg takedown.
Wrestlers use this common yet effective offensive technique to get their opponent on the mat.
“[The double leg takedown] is a basic takedown in which you attack both of your opponent’s legs at once,” former national team assistant coach Erin Vandiver says.
HOW TO DO A DOUBLE LEG TAKEDOWN
To execute a double leg takedown, you need to begin in a good stance. Following these instructions:
Remember to keep your head up with your ear tight to your opponent when you perform the double leg takedown. Your back should be straight with your chest tight to your opponent’s hips.
“A double leg takedown is an explosive technique used to take your opponent from their feet to the mat,” Vandiver says.
In addition to the double leg takedown, you'll also want to work on the single leg takedown. A quick execution of the move can be an effective way to take an opponent off their feet and onto the mat.
To effectively use a double leg takedown, you'll want to practice your shooting skills.

The Basics of the Single Leg Takedown
The single leg takedown is a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling that can provide a significant advantage over your opponent. It involves taking control of one of your opponent’s legs and bringing them down to the ground while maintaining control. Mastering this technique requires a combination of proper footwork, positioning, gripping techniques, and a well-executed level change and penetration step.
Footwork and Positioning
Having correct footwork and positioning is crucial for a successful single leg takedown. To begin, establish a solid wrestling stance with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. This stance allows for better balance and agility, enabling you to react quickly to your opponent’s movements.
When going for a single leg takedown, step forward with your lead leg towards your opponent’s lead leg. Your lead leg should be outside of your opponent’s lead leg, creating an angle that provides a better opportunity to attack. Maintain a low center of gravity, keeping your head up and eyes focused on your opponent’s upper body.
Gripping Techniques
Proper gripping techniques are essential for gaining control of your opponent’s leg during a single leg takedown. There are various gripping options, but two common techniques are the high crotch grip and the ankle pick grip.
The high crotch grip involves reaching your same-side arm across your opponent’s body and securing a hold on their upper thigh, just below their hip. This grip allows for better control and leverage when executing the takedown.
The ankle pick grip, on the other hand, involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle with your same-side hand. This grip is effective when your opponent’s leg is extended or when they resist the high crotch grip.
Experiment with different gripping techniques and find the one that works best for you based on your opponent’s positioning and reactions.
Level Change and Penetration Step
Executing a proper level change and penetration step is the key to successfully completing a single leg takedown. A level change involves dropping your level by bending your knees and lowering your hips closer to the ground. This motion helps you avoid your opponent’s attacks and allows for a smoother transition into the takedown.
After the level change, perform a penetration step by driving your lead leg forward and shooting it towards your opponent’s leg. Simultaneously, reach for your desired grip on their leg, either high crotch or ankle pick. The penetration step should be explosive and quick, catching your opponent off guard and making it harder for them to defend.
Remember to maintain a strong grip, keep your head up, and drive through your opponent’s leg as you finish the takedown. Proper execution of the level change and penetration step, combined with precise footwork and effective gripping techniques, will greatly increase your chances of mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Common Variations of the Single Leg Takedown
High Crotch
The high crotch is a powerful and effective variation of the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg with your head positioned on the outside of their body. By grabbing their leg with both hands, you can drive forward and lift their leg off the ground, taking them down to the mat. The high crotch is known for its versatility, as it can be executed from various positions and angles. It requires good timing, speed, and technique to successfully execute the high crotch and secure the takedown.
Ankle Pick
Another common variation of the single leg takedown is the ankle pick. As the name suggests, this technique involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle and pulling it towards you, destabilizing their balance and setting up the takedown. The ankle pick is often executed when your opponent is in a defensive stance or when they are attempting to sprawl to defend against a regular single leg takedown. By quickly snatching their ankle and driving forward, you can bring them down to the mat and gain control.
Knee Tap
The knee tap is a variation of the single leg takedown that focuses on targeting your opponent’s knee for a swift takedown. This technique involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg, much like a regular single leg takedown, but instead of grabbing their leg, you aim to tap or push their knee with your hand. By applying pressure on their knee and redirecting their momentum, you can force them off balance and bring them down to the mat. The knee tap is particularly effective against opponents who have a strong base and are difficult to lift off the ground.
These variations of the single leg takedown provide wrestlers with a range of options to take down their opponents in freestyle wrestling. Each technique has its own advantages and requires practice to master. By incorporating these variations into your arsenal, you can become a more well-rounded wrestler with multiple takedown options at your disposal.
Defending Against the Single Leg Takedown
Sprawling
Sprawling is a crucial defensive technique when countering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves using your hips and legs to create distance and prevent your opponent from getting a hold of your leg. To perform a sprawl effectively, follow these steps:
Remember, practicing sprawls regularly is essential to develop the speed, timing, and technique required to defend against the single leg takedown effectively.
Whizzer and Overhook
Another effective method to defend against the single leg takedown is by utilizing the whizzer and overhook techniques. These techniques are especially useful when your opponent manages to secure a grip on your leg. Here’s how to execute the whizzer and overhook:
By mastering the whizzer and overhook techniques, you can effectively neutralize your opponent’s single leg takedown attempts and gain an advantage in the match.
Front Headlock
The front headlock is another valuable defensive technique that can be utilized to counter the single leg takedown. This technique involves controlling your opponent’s head and arm to prevent them from successfully executing the takedown. Here’s how to perform a front headlock:
Practicing the front headlock technique will not only enhance your defense against the single leg takedown but also open up various offensive possibilities.
Remember, mastering these defensive techniques takes time, practice, and repetition. By focusing on your sprawl, whizzer and overhook, and front headlock skills, you will significantly improve your ability to defend against the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Drills to Improve Single Leg Takedown
Shadow Drilling
Shadow drilling is a fundamental training technique that helps wrestlers perfect their single leg takedown. By visualizing an opponent and performing the movements without actual resistance, wrestlers can focus on their form and technique. Here are some key drills to incorporate into your shadow drilling routine:
Stance and Motion: Start by assuming the proper wrestling stance, with your lead leg forward and your weight distributed evenly. Practice moving in and out of your stance, circling, and level changing. This drill helps develop agility and quick footwork, which are crucial for executing a successful single leg takedown.
Penetration Step: The penetration step is the initial move in a single leg takedown. Practice driving off your back leg, stepping forward with your lead leg, and shooting your arm deep between your opponent’s legs. Focus on explosive power and maintaining a low center of gravity throughout the movement.
Finish Position: Once you have secured your opponent’s leg, it’s important to practice the proper finish position. Work on driving through your opponent, lifting their leg, and keeping your head up. Pay attention to your hand placement and grip, as they significantly impact your control over your opponent.
Partner Drills
Partner drills provide a dynamic training experience that simulates real-life wrestling scenarios. These drills help develop timing, coordination, and the ability to react to an opponent’s movements. Incorporate the following partner drills into your training regimen to enhance your single leg takedown skills:
Leg Defense Drill: Have your partner stand in a defensive position while you attempt single leg takedowns. Your partner’s goal is to sprawl and defend against your takedown attempts. Focus on properly executing your takedown technique while your partner tries to counter and defend. This drill improves your ability to read and react to your opponent’s movements.
Resistance Drill: Start in a neutral position with your partner. Initiate a single leg takedown while your partner provides resistance, forcing you to exert more effort to complete the takedown. This drill helps build strength and endurance while maintaining proper technique under pressure.
Counter Drill: In this drill, your partner attempts a single leg takedown while you work on countering their move. Practice sprawling, sprawling and turning, or executing a defensive technique like a whizzer. This drill improves your defensive skills and teaches you how to disrupt your opponent’s takedown attempts.
Live Situational Sparring
Live situational sparring involves engaging in controlled wrestling scenarios with a partner. It allows wrestlers to apply their single leg takedown skills in a realistic, dynamic setting. Here are some situational sparring scenarios to incorporate into your training:
Starting from Neutral: Begin the sparring session from a neutral position, with both you and your partner on your feet. Focus on initiating single leg takedown attempts while your partner defends and counters. This scenario simulates the unpredictability of a real wrestling match and helps sharpen your takedown skills under live conditions.
Starting from a Specific Position: Start the sparring session from various positions, such as starting with one wrestler already in on a single leg. This situation allows you to practice defending against an opponent in a dominant position and finding opportunities to counter and execute your own takedown.
Live Wrestling with Specific Objectives: Set specific objectives for the sparring session, such as scoring points with a single leg takedown or successfully defending against your partner’s takedown attempts. This type of situational sparring helps wrestlers focus on particular aspects of their single leg takedown game and improve their overall strategy.
By incorporating these drills and sparring scenarios into your training routine, you can enhance your single leg takedown skills and become a more formidable wrestler in freestyle wrestling. Practice diligently, stay focused, and never stop refining your technique.
In conclusion, mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling is a crucial skill that can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. By understanding the proper technique, positioning, and timing, wrestlers can effectively take down their opponents and gain an advantage in matches. The single leg takedown offers a versatile and reliable option for both offensive and defensive strategies, making it a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling. With consistent practice and dedication, wrestlers can develop their skills and become proficient in executing this technique. So, whether you are a beginner or an experienced wrestler, mastering the single leg takedown is an essential step towards achieving success in freestyle wrestling.

From a Russian tie, you can hit all types of shots, ankle picks, and even throws.
Here is 2016 Olympian Georgi Ivanov going over three takedowns from a Russian tie.
Reverse Arm Throw
One common defense to a Russian tie is for your opponent to grab your elbow. This reverse arm throw is a great option when they do.
This throw starts in a two on one position except, you are going to reverse your grip with the bottom hand. Once you have your grip switched up, you are going to pull your opponent behind you which loads them up to be thrown.
From this position, you will do a quick level change and a slightly turn your body as the back knee goes down to the mat. Keep the arm tight with both your arms and even use your head to pinched their arm. Then, use the knee that is on the mat to drive forward and throw your opponent. Be sure to not just try to pull them over your shoulder; use your core and legs to create the power.
Head to Chest Fireman’s Carry
Even though Georgi calls this a fireman’s carry, it is not quite the traditional fireman’s carry we are used to seeing. The first thing you need to do is to secure a Russian tie. When you have the arm secured, you will take a small step forward with your outside foot. At the same time you step, you will lift the arm to try to stand your opponent up. Watch how Georgi keeps the arm tight to the chest and just does a quick pull on the arm to create space.

After you lift your opponent up, you are going to step behind your opponent's near leg with your near leg. Be sure to keep your knee bent at about 90 degrees. This will prevent your opponent from stepping their leg back. Then you are going to use your far arm to grab the knee and get your head tight to your opponent’s chest.
Watch how Georgi keeps everything nice and tight and even keeps a lot of pressure on the upper arm. Then just like he shows in the video, you are going to drive into your opponent and take them over you knee to their back. Be sure to be ready to hold them here to get your back points.
Elbow Pinch Lateral Drop
This lateral drop is another great option you can hit from a Russian tie. One of the reasons that it works well is because you can hit it when your opponent grabs your elbow to defend the position. Start out in a good Russian tie position and make sure the arm is tight to your body. Watch how Georgi uses his belly to block his opponent’s arm and then takes the hand that is on the wrist and brings it up to almost an underhook position. Be sure to look the direction you are planning on throwing. Then pop your hips and launch your opponent.
If you have trouble hitting this throw here are a couple of things to look at. First, are you stepping in deep enough. Your hips need to be close to your opponent’s hips. If there is too much space, the throw won’t work. Another thing to look at is are you able to pop your hips. If you can’t already do a lateral drop form and over under position, you probably aren’t ready to for this variation of a lateral drop. Lastly, make sure you are committing to the throw. It’s either all or nothing with throws, if you are only give 75% chances are it won’t work the way you want it to.
There are so many different moves that you can hit from a Russian tie. These three are not only very effective, but also put your opponent to their back which is great, especially for freestyle.

The Front Headlock is a very dangerous position for the defensive guy, and an extremely controlling position for the guy on offense. Whenever your opponent is hanging his head down a little you can snap his head down. You can also get this if your opponent takes a bad shot and you sprawl good enough that he's not on your legs or barely has them. It's very easy to control your opponent with a Front Headlock and if used correctly you should be able to get a takedown.
You will pull his head underneath your chest. Grab the chin with your right hand while keeping your elbow high so it's harder for him to grab it. Your arm should be fairly shallow. You can even grip the neck, making your elbow even harder to reach. Your right shoulder should be digging into his trap muscle on the left side of his neck. With your left hand, you'll grab the opposite arm and lift it up. Keeping one of his arms elevated makes it so he can only use one to either support himself or defend his position. If you stuff his arm above his head it will warm his upper-body and make him especially uncomfortable. You can be over the arm or underneath it, but we recommend being over unless you're trying to get a Cement Job and other related moves.
Ideally, you'll want to snap him down to the mat and finish from there. You have more control on the mat than on your feet.
Front Headlock On Feet
You'll have the Front Headlock, but both you and your opponent will be standing on your feet. So this is before you snap him down to the mat. Usually you'll get here while hand-fighting or if he takes a bad shot but doesn't fully commit and you snap the head under your chest. You can control this by lifting the arm up with your arm on the outside, or by having your arm under his arm (Under-Hook, Cement Job). I recommend you try to keep your hand on the outside to lower the chances of him grabbing both elbows and forcing a stalemate.
Front Headlock Defense On Feet
Your head is stuck under his chest so he has a Front Headlock. The goal is to get out of this position as soon as possible before it gets any worse. You can shoot out of most tie-ups, but for this one I want you to get out of it first before you attack. These moves have that goal in mind. If you try to shoot under a Front Headlock there's a very good chance that an experienced wrestler will feel this start to happen and he'll sprawl on you, making the situation worse for yourself. Do not dig yourself a bigger hole. Do not get into a false sense of security thinking that moves that work against bad wrestlers will work against good wrestlers. Remember: your style should not change depending on who you're wrestling. You need to have consistent and good technique if you want to win consistently. Don't use bad technique just because you can. Develop good habits that you'll need to use against good wrestlers.
Front Headlock On The Mat
This would be when you have the Front Headlock but down on the mat. Your opponent will be on his hands and knees, you should be off of your knees to improve your mobility and to put more pressure or weight on your opponent. You can snap his head down repeatedly (bounce the head) to break him down and keep his weight on his hands, but don't do it too often or too aggressively or you'll end up giving up Unnecessary Roughness call.
Front Headlock Defense On The
When you're on the mat and stuck in a Front Headlock, you should probably grab an elbow and pull it down as soon as you can. This will secure your position a little bit and give you time to improve your situation. It'll also limit the amount of attacks the top wrestler can use and it will keep him in front of you. You can grab the chin hand with two hands and post it down, but it's a little bit more dangerous because the top guy has a lot more mobility in this situation compared to when you're on your feet. He can start to spin around you and with his weight on you it's harder to match his rotation. Grabbing the elbow solves this a little better.
Front Headlock Short Offense
To me this means you'll be keeping your arms short, hands over top of the head and/or shoulders. This way your opponent cannot grab your elbows and slow you down in this position. You'll have a lot more mobility, but you will have less control of your opponent. Make sure you keep your hips low, knees off the mat, feet wide and back. You don't want to run into a random shot, and you don't want to lose him completely.",0.97722,How to Perform Pro Wrestling Moves (with Pictures) - wikiHow,https://www.wikihow.com/Perform-Pro-Wrestling-Moves,"Place your hand on the back of your standing opponents neck.

The other hand should go across your opponent's back. Be sure to keep a lot of pressure on the head and neck of your opponent.","Dominate Your Opponent With Front Headlocks
Developing a good offense is vital if you want to succeed in wrestling. Some of the first takedowns a wrestler usually learns are different types of shots like a single leg or a double leg and these are great options to get takedowns. Another great way to score takedowns is with front headlocks.
Front headlocks have some advantages over shots when it comes to scoring points. First of all, it is easier to stay out of messy scramble situations when you get a front headlock locked up when compared to shooting a shot. Also, there are many different options from a front headlock position to put your opponent right to their back. Lastly, when you have a guy in a front headlock, it really wears them out because the have to carry your weight on their arms.
Let’s look at some great finishes from a front headlock.
Throw By
The first finish is a simple throw by. and comes from blocking a shot. This finish can be hit from an open or closed front headlock.
When you hit a throw by, you need to keep a lot of pressure on your opponent’s head and neck. In addition to pressure, you need to keep your opponent moving. If you stop moving, it will allow them time to defend the front headlock. You will chase the far leg, which should be the only leg you can see and your opponent’s natural response will be to keep circling to try to face you. If they happen to not try to face you, then you will be able to just spin behind for the easy take down.
Once you get your opponent circling, throw the head and arm by hard, almost like you are trying to stir a big pot; then attacks the hips and earn your two points. This move is all about circling and snaps, the more you focus on those two things, the easier the throw by will be. Check out this video of Bekzod Abdurakhminov hitting his variation of it.

Head In The Hole
Another great option from a front headlock is to put your head in the hole which means to bury your head in their side and chase the far leg. To do this correctly, you are going to stay tight on the chin and bring your elbow to your side which bends your opponents neck laterally. Then drive your head deep into their rib cage (the hole) and attack either the leg at the knee or you can even reach up and grab their opposite hip.
If you attack the knee, you can even turn it into a near side cradle by driving into them until you can lock your hands together. If you want to get real fancy with a cradle from the head in the hole position, check out this roll through cradle by Hudson Taylor. If you are having trouble locking up a basic near side cradle, this is a great option to get the pin.
Cow Catcher
One move you can hit from an open front headlock is a cow catcher, sometimes also called a bulldog or a cement mixer. Now sometimes this move get criticized at a move that will not work against high level competition, but Iowa wrestlers hit this all the time in big matches.
It starts with an open front headlock. The arm that is on the elbow slides under the arm, like an underhook, and you sink it in deep. At the same time, you step up with the leg on that same side and with the other arm, clamp down on your opponent’s head. From here, drive into them, stay heavy on their head and put them to their back. You should end up with a really tight half which makes for an easy pin.
Head and Arm Roll
If you are looking for another finish from the front headlock position that puts your opponent straight to their back, check out this head and arm roll by Ed Ruth.
With this front headlock, instead of closing it up by grabbing your hand, watch how Ruth shoots the arm really deep under the chin and arm then locks on to his own elbow. The other hand should go across your opponent’s back. Be sure to keep a lot of pressure on the head and neck of your opponent. Ruth refers to this as sinking in to it. Then just run your feet to the outside to increase pressure and tuck you head under and roll. Then, step over and secure the pin.
If you want to really step up your offensive game, you need to start working front headlocks into your arsenal. There have been many high level wrestlers that have scored a lot of points from front headlocks.

The Duck Under is one of the most important attacks in grappling. The reason the duck under is so valuable is because of what it achieves if done correctly. In wrestling, when two athletes square off, they are in an equal position to both attack and defend. The reason is because they can both see what the other wrestler is doing, both arms and legs are free to move and defend as necessary.
If a wrestler can successfully perform a Duck Under, they remove all of the tools their opponent has. They cannot see you as you are behind them, the arms and legs do not have as much dexterity while reaching behind the body, and because of the close contact movement is restricted.
It does not matter whether it is submission grappling, Greco Roman, Freestyle or Folkstyle, if a wrestler gets behind another, that wrestler has an incredible advantage to attack. Leaving the other wrestler to solely focus on defending.
At this point we could argue over who has had the best Duck Under over the years or who coached the best wrestlers etc. What we cannot debate over is statistical fact, and statistically speaking the best American wrestler of all time is John Smith.
John has had a very successful coaching career since his last Olympic Gold Medal in 1992, and has consistently produced some of the most dominant NCAA Champions over the last 3 decades.
So when John Smith talks wrestling, you listen. Look on the internet for Duck Under instructionals. How many of those videos even last 5 minutes? What you are about to see is an almost 15 minute masterclass on how to perform the duck under and why it is important from one of the greatest wrestlers the world has ever seen.
This is a Masterclass on the duck under. So get comfortable, take notes and enjoy this excerpt from Johns Instructional series.
This is quite the exchange that John shows. Using that overhand “Monkey Grip” on the side he is going to step into the center to pull down hard as he Ducks the opposite side is incredible. His other leg creates distance to the outside.
John makes no assumptions that this will work every time, but what he said is great about the Duck is the changing of levels, so instead of coming up and going around the back he can transition into a double or another attack. John explains that the duck under is one of the most exciting and “wow” moves a werstler can have in their arsenal.
Using the elbow control allows a wrestler to be aggressive and create reactions. Once you get that reaction you get low and explode around the corner.  As he says “I get position and I am gone!” meaning he is driving through that take down.
Being a realist, John says that your hands are going to lose grip from time to time. So he explains that if you lose the grip, the hands will come down, and you will be right in a double leg takedown position, but you have to be ready for it.
This is the kind of detail John goes into on all of his techniques. He starts with fundamental concepts, moves through the move, then options in case things don't go well! The “American” has created one of the most comprehensive attack systems ever recorded with Fanatic Wrestling. A six part instructional that covers it all, the OSU way.

Armdrag – The Ultimate Research Guide For BJJ, MMA & Wrestling
Contents
In my training, I have noticed the prevalence of the armdrag in bjj, wrestling or mma used in setting up various techniques.
Rarely, though, have I received detailed instruction on the armdrag (or arm drag) itself. I got curious about its details and did some research.
Then, I asked myself,
Therefore, these questions guided my research.
After that, I decided to share it with you, the reader, here because I figure other people may have similar questions.
Read more:
What is the ArmDrag In BJJ & MMA?
First at all, The armdrag puts your opponent in a vulnerable position.
Remember: This creates a wide variety of options for you to use as follow up.
Besides, the armdrag is a simple technique that puts you in a strong position and neutralizes a lot of your opponent’s options for attacking you.
The Importance of ﻿armdrag In BJJ & mma
In detail, the arm drag accomplishes three major objectives:
Key Takeaway: Balance is vital. If your opponent is fighting for balance, they aren’t fighting you.
Power generation depends on a solid base.
Without good balance, your opponent doesn’t have a solid base and can’t generate much power.
If you control your opponent’s axis, you can neutralize the effectiveness of their upper body tools. In order to strike you, your opponent must orient to you with good structure.
By controlling your opponent’s axis, you prevent that orientation and, coupled with the diminished power they have from being unbalanced, the armdrag neutralizes a lot of your opponent’s tools and minimizes the risk you face.
If you get behind your opponent, you have a significant positional advantage. You have a wealth of good targets, any of which might quickly shut down your opponent.
How To Do the Basic Arm Drag In BJJ & MMA
1 . Gain Control of Your Opponent’s Wrist:
Mostly, you can gain control of your opponent’s wrist either by grabbing it, or allowing your opponent to grab your wrist. Either way, it places his arm into a position from which you can perform the arm drag.
WHY?
Let’s me explain.
If your opponent has your wrist, you might still be able to move your arm.
If so, your opponent may follow your motion, in which case you can achieve the armdrag without grabbing your opponent’s wrist at all.
Often, though, you need to get control of your opponent’s wrist.
From their grab, you can use a wrist roll to reverse the situation so you end up grabbing their wrist.
2 . Pu
ll Your Opponent’s Arm Down:
WHY?
Pull your opponent’s wrist down to isolate their arm and unbalance them.
This also straightens their arm and creates an opening through which you can reach to acquire the grip necessary to accomplish the armdrag.
People often overlook this step and have problems getting their hand into position for a successful arm drag.
3 . Grab Your Opponent’s Triceps:
Triceps Brachii
Hook your free hand behind the triceps muscle on your opponent’s isolated arm.
Don’t grab the arm or use grip strength. Instead, form a hook with your hand, thumb tucked against your index finger, and place the hook behind your opponent’s triceps.
4 . Drag Your Opponent’s Arm Across Your Body
Drag the arm down and across your body.
If you’re dragging their right arm, for instance, your right hand will grip their right triceps, and you’ll pull it across your body past your right hip.
As you do this, sink your weight into your right leg so you add your mass to the pull rather than just using your arm muscles.
Also, rotate your body rather than pulling your arm back.
Again, this adds mass to the motion.
Pulling with your arm can also cause you to violate your own structure and unbalance yourself.
This could create an opportunity for your opponent to close on you and neutralize, if not overcome, the advantage you sought through the use of the arm drag.
4 Exercises For ArmDrag
1. Pummeling to arm drag
In wrestling, the term “pummeling” applies to the use of your arms and upper body to achieve an advantageous position on your opponent, see the definition here.
A simple exercise is to work the arm drag from the pummeling drill.
In the midst of pummeling, slide your overhooked arm down to gain control of your training partner’s wrist, pull down to unbalance your partner and prevent them from performing their next pummel.
This creates an opening in the timing and an opening in your partner’s structure where you can bring your underhooking arm across to catch the tricep on the arm you have controlled.
Perform the armdrag, unbalance your partner, then reset and begin pummeling again so your training partner can work the arm drag.
See the advanced Judo & Bjj technique here:
2. Reversal to Armdrag
You can expand the previous pummeling drill to include reversals.
This turns the basic pummeling to armdrag drill into a controlled spar where you try to get the armdrag before your partner can reverse it.
And this will inevitably lead to “hand-fighting.”
3. Hand-Fighting to Armdrag
Hand-fighting a free-form sparring game used in wrestling to develop skills useful for getting past your opponent’s upper body defenses and get to an advantageous position.
Use free-form hand-fighting as a platform to find the arm drag. This allows you to work a variety of tools while still focusing on developing your armdrag.
Pro Tip: in wrestling, hand-fighting is a way to gain an advantageous position, but in the Filipino arts, the same hand-fighting play can be used to train weapon retention. You can use hand-fighting techniques to prevent an opponent from getting control of your weapon.​
4. Filipino Higot Hubad Lubad to Arm Drag
In the Filipino martial arts, “higot hubad lubad” is a common set of drills. Commonly, it is referred to simply as “hubad lubad” or just “hubad.”
There are quite a few variations including forehand, backhand, straight punch, elbows, uppercuts, and the lower body tools like knees and kicks can also be incorporated.
Since this isn’t an article about hubad, we won’t go into detail on all those variations.
We’ll use the forehand hubad as shown in the linked video. It has 3 basic elements:
Assuming you’re doing hubad on the right side, as shown in the linked video, you can do these steps:
5. A Common Question
A common question is,
“When you bring their right down to your left, what if they hit you with their left hand?”
This is a valid question but here are things to consider.
What Next? 9 Follow Up Options
1. Hyperextension
One of the first things to notice is, when you pull your opponent’s right arm across you, extend your left hand to hyperextend the isolated arm. This can injure your opponent’s arm, and it can cause a minor whiplash effect on your opponent’s neck.
If your opponent has a weapon, such as a knife, in their right hand the hyperextension might cause them to drop the weapon. It’s not guaranteed, but it is a high probability. While this might not be the best option as a knife defense, it is a valid one.
Pro Tip: the tricep tendon, which connects the tricep muscle to the elbow joint, is a sweet spot for hyperextension. Make sure to cut into this tendon with your hooking hand.
2. Forward Sweep
In Silat, this sweep is called a “sapu dalam.”
Pro Tip: send your anchor down, not out. There may be situational reasons to direct your opponent in some direction other than down but, generally, the reason you sweep is to put your opponent on the ground.
3. Double Leg Takedown
The arm drag exposes the opponent’s side to you and provides a great set up for a double leg takedown. You can see a example here
Pro Tip: place your head hard against your opponent’s hip to give yourself good leverage and minimize your opponent’s ability to catch your head in a choke or neck crank.
4. Inside Trip (Kouchi Gake)
This armdrag takedown works well against bigger, stronger opponents because it incorporates a low, strong base with a lot of mass, moved by large muscle groups, directly against your opponent’s leg.
This arm drag takedown puts you into a strong position, from which you can often gain mount.
5. D’Arce Choke
D’Arce choke, named after Joe D’Arce, a third-degree black belt under Renzo Gracie, is done by shooting your arm under your opponent’s arm and neck.
The armdrag is a great set up for this choke because it provides the opening under your opponent’s arm you need to shoot through for the choke.
Pro Tip: as you shoot your arm behind your opponent’s head, bear down with it to firmly seat their neck into the crook of your arm.
To apply the choke, either pull your opponent into you and squeeze, or drive the opponent to his left, where they have no arm to base.
Drive forward to put your body weight onto them and finish the choke.
6. Sweep from Guard
The armdrag, done slightly differently in the video below, can also unbalance your opponent when they’re in your guard.
This rolls your opponent to his back, brings you to a mounted position. This also pins your opponent’s right arm between your chest and theirs.
The armdrag provides ready access to your opponent’s back.
Pro Tip: if you clench your right hand into a fist behind your opponent’s head, you minimize the risk of your opponent getting hold of your fingers, and the fist increases the pressure on the choke.
8. Striking Targets from the Back
Other options once you reach your opponent’s back include striking the base of the occipital bone, known as Gall Bladder 20 in Chinese medicine and martial arts.
A sharp strike to this area has a high probability to cause a knock out.
The kidney is another prime target once you get to your opponent’s back.
A good punch to the kidney will cause your opponent’s lower back muscles to clench in an effort to protect the kidney.
This will put your opponent in a very vulnerable position and usually expose your opponent’s neck, which can be a good set up to get to the rear naked choke.
9. Use Opponent as a Shield
A useful strategy when dealing with multiple opponents is to get one opponent between you and the other opponents.
You can use an armdrag to get to one opponent’s back then catch the opponent in, for instance, a rear naked choke and use the opponent as a shield against incoming attacks from other opponents.
You might also use the opponent’s vulnerable structure and lack of balance to shove them toward other opponents.
Key Takeaway: This tactic can create an opening to improve your own situation by getting to an exit, getting to a weapon, or buying time until your own reinforcements can arrive to help you.

Conclusion
I hope you have enjoyed this post.
The armdrag is beautiful in its simplicity.
As discussed, it creates vulnerabilities in your opponent’s structure that you can exploit in a variety of ways.
The arm drag can give you the opportunity for sweeps, locks, chokes, strikes, and more. It can be a powerful tool in your kit. Work it slow and ingrain the feeling of it through high repetition so it will serve you when you need it.
You should find the armdrag useful in your own training or even self-defense, regardless of your background.

Freestyle wrestling has always played an important role in the development of the BJJ game. Much of the sport is based on takedown systems that have been borrowed from this style of grappling. There are also many principles of weight distribution that allows Jiu-Jitsu athletes to be dominant on the mat. Technically, no other martial art, with the possible exception of judo, has had as much impact on the BJJ as freestyle wrestling. The Arm Drag is a position and a takedown, it’s a point of control and a pivot opportunity for many transitions. Overall, it’s a very versatile movement that has managed to find firm footing within Gentle Art. Let’s see how Jiu-Jitsu not only borrowed this movement from wrestling, but also took it in completely new directions.
Perhaps the most difficult but important aspect of the arm drag is to understand that, even if your goal is to literally drag your opponent in the direction in which you pull your arm, it is important to move around that arm. It’s about understanding how your weight displaces the other person and remembering Newton’s third law: for each action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. With this in mind, it should be remembered that by pulling the opponent down, he is potentially able to stand up and move. This is where the arm drag creates opportunity.
The Basics
There are many great competitors in Jiu-Jitsu and MMA who have used this technique to succeed on the competition mats. The best known is perhaps Marcelo Garcia, who used arms arm in many of his games with amazing effect. There are of course many others who are successfully using this on the mats, especially in the NoGi game.
What makes the arm drag so effective in part, is because people are usually weak behind the elbow joint. That is, if you catch someone behind the elbow and pull your arm forward, your opponent’s ability to stop will most probably be less than the force you can apply. More importantly, the position of the arm depends on the ability of the dragger to force the person to support their weight for a fraction of time, forcing them to fall forward. People who are really good at arm drags can handle much bigger opponents than they are by forcing them to use one of the weaker parts of their body to carry their weight.
The concept is relatively simple: even taking a relatively strong practitioner off of his centre of gravity will probably require them to compensate. Add to that the fact that the opponent is unbalanced, because of the mechanics of the position, and you have the advantage. During this moment, whether or not it leads to a fall, the shooter can easily move around his opponent.
A pivotal element of arm dragging is getting out of the opponent’s way. Very often, the beginner’s mistake is to drag an opponent down but then get caught under his weight instead of moving around him. When performing an arm drag, the most important part of the movement is to escape the hips to the side of the arm being dragged. Thus allowing the movement opportunity needed to secure a successful takedown.
How To Perform The Move
Arm drag leads to several opportunities for situational improvement. Even a failed arm drag can put the person attempting it in position for a throw or other positional changes in their favour. Arm drag resistance requires a certain degree of unbalanced force on the part of the opponent.
On the feet, the arm drag sets up a variety of takedowns and trips. While in the match in a jiu-jitsu match, the positional advantage can setup numerous back-take positions. Since all the matches are starting from stand up, let’s have a look at a few setups. A particularly effective arm drag is the famous double leg takedown. So why does the arm drag work so well in this situation? The first reason is that it removes a possible frame (the opponent’s arm) from the defence and the second reason is that it will put you in a subtle angle that will make the double leg work.

Arm Drags on the Ground
An arm drag from the guard can be used with incredible effect. It’s movement, which causes people to come off the centre line, allows for an easy route to half-guard and then the back. From half-guard, you have a number of options, continue the movement to the back, or re-establish to a butterfly guard, depending on your opponent’s movement, again the arm drag is extremely effective from this position.
Arm Drag To the Back
Taking the back from the drag can also be done standing, off the back and in a seated guard position. From there, you can use any technique on your opponent’s back. In gi, you have a lot of chokes available, but in no gi, the RNC in the back is always king.
Other Positional Opportunities
Since the arm drag works so well, it’s a valuable option to experiment with during training. If you fit in one of these positions, try it, and see what happens. This could very well become one of your favourite moves in Jiu Jitsu.
The more you play with the move, the more you will see the possibilities of using it. The more you start to understand it, the better you can use it to improve your own game. The key to this move, and for any move, is to drill it. No one wants to be dragged to the ground and strangled. The placement of the grip is, therefore, the key to the success of the move. Drilling helps to understand naturally the placement of the position. The more you drill the movement, the easier you’ll be able to pull it off in sparring and competition.

Wrestling For BJJ – How To Master The Arm Drag
Wrestling has always played a huge role in the development of BJJ. Much of the stand-up game is based on takedown systems that have been borrowed from wrestling. There are also a lot of the weight distribution principles that allow Jiu-Jitsu athletes to be so dominant on the ground. Technically speaking, no other grappling martial art, except for maybe Judo, has had such a big impact on BJJ as wrestling. The Arm Drag is a position and a takedown. it is a control and a pivot point for many transitions. All in all, it is a very versatile move that has successfully found fertile ground in the Gentle Art. Let’s look at how BJJ not only borrowed this move from wrestling but took it into completely new directions along the way.
Perhaps the most difficult but important aspect of the arm drag is understanding that as much as your goal is to quite literally drag your opponent in the direction in which you are pulling their arm is important, moving around that arm is equally crucial. It is a question of understanding how your weight moves the other person and remembering Newton’s Third Law: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Bearing this in mind one needs to remember that in pulling the opponent down they are potentially able to pull themselves up, and around.
Mechanics of The Arm Drag
There are many great competitors who have made use of this technique in their competition successes. Perhaps best known for this is Marcelo Garcia who used arm drags in many of his matches with fantastic effect. There are, of course, many others who use it successfully.
Part of what makes the arm drag so effective is that people are generally weak behind the elbow. That is to say if you grab someone behind their elbow and pull their arm forward their ability to stop you is likely to be less than the force you can apply. More importantly, the arm drag relies on the dragger’s ability to force the person being dragged to bear their weight for a short time, thus forcing them to fall forward. People who get really good at arm drags are able to manipulate opponents much larger than them by forcing them to use one of the weaker areas of their bodies to carry their weight.
The concept is relatively simple: Pulling even a relatively strong practitioner away from their center of gravity will likely force them to compensate. Add to that the fact that the opponent is off balance due to the mechanics of the position and you’ve got the upper hand for sure. During that compensation, whether or not it results in them falling, the arm-dragger can easily move around their opponent.
A crucial element of the arm drag is getting out of the opponent’s way.  Very often the rookie mistake is to drag an opponent down but to then be trapped under their weight rather than to move around them.  When hitting an arm drag, the most important part of the move is escaping one’s hips to the side of the arm being dragged.
Arm Drag Takedowns
Arm drags lead to various opportunities for positional improvement.  Even a failed arm drag can put the person attempting it in position for a takedown or another position change in their favor.  Resisting the arm drag requires a certain degree of off-balanced force by the resister.
On the feet, the arm drag sets up a variety of takedowns and trips. While on the ground, it sets up back takes sweeps and submissions. Since all matches start standing, let’s talk about how it sets up takedowns. One particularly effective takedown of an arm drag is the double leg. Though why does the arm drag work so well here? The first reason is that it gets rid of a possible frame (the opponent’s arm) of defense and the second reason is that it will put you at a subtle angle that will make the takedown work. Check out how Marcelo Garcia, master of the drag, uses it to set it up.
Arm Dragging From Guard
When on the ground, the arm drag can be used with great effect from the half guard. In half guard one can initiate back takes with relative ease using an intelligently placed grip. The half guard pairs nicely with butterfly, making the arm drag extra potent from either position.
From the closed guard, the arm drag provides a great path to the back as well as entries to various submissions, depending on how an opponent reacts to the back take attempt. The more you play the arm drag game the more openings and opportunities you will find to use it.
Arm Drag To The Back
Last, but certainly not least, is the ability to take the back from an arm drag. Taking the back from the drag can be done standing, off of your back and from a seated position just to name a few. From there, you can hit any technique that you like from your opponent’s back. In gi, you have plenty of gi chokes and in no gi, the rear naked choke is still king.
Long Island MMA fighter Rob Diggle shows how to enter into a leg lock position from an arm drag:
The more you play with the arm drag the more you’ll see opportunities to use it.  The more you understand it, the better you’ll be able to use it to further your own Jiu-Jitsu game.  The key to this move is to drill it.  No one wants to be dragged to the ground and choked, so grip placement is key to success with the move. Drilling aids in innately understanding grip placement.  The more you drill the move the better you’ll understand it.

In trading, managing risk is essential to ensuring long-term success. There are various risk management strategies you can employ, and trailing stop-loss orders stand out as a versatile tool for minimising potential losses.
YOUR CAPITAL IS AT RISK
The right trailing stop will keep you in a trade for the duration of the trend and take you out when the trend is exhausted. It will protect you from closing a trade too soon or too late. In this article, we will cover the best stop-loss strategies you can utilise.

What Is a Trailing Stop Loss Order and How Does It Work?
A trailing stop is a stop-loss order that tracks the price of the asset you are trading and is automatically adjusted. The trailing stop is different from the traditional stop-loss order as it moves in line with the asset’s price, hence securing your profits.
A trailing stop loss is usually set at a fixed distance away from the current market price and moves in line with the price. If the trailing stop is placed on a buy trade, it will rise as the price rises while maintaining the set distance. However, the trailing stop loss will not move if the price reverses, closing your trade.
Let’s say we opened a buy trade on the EUR/USD currency pair trading at 1.1200 and had a 15-point trailing stop on our position. The trailing stop would be positioned at 1.1185 at the start but would keep rising with the currency pair’s price.
Over the course of the day, the EUR/USD currency pair rallied to a high of 1.1300, giving us an open profit of 100 pips with our trailing stop at 1.1285. The next day, we have negative news from the eurozone triggering a selloff in the pair to a low of 1.1250.
However, our trade will be closed at 1.1285. This is where the trailing stop was positioned protecting much of our open profits.
Trailing Stop-Loss Strategies
With this in mind, let’s move on to potential trailing stop-loss strategies to deploy in your trading strategy.
Strategy 1: Average True Range (ATR)
The Average True Range (ATR) trailing stop strategy is one of the best trailing stop-loss strategies and is very popular among traders. The strategy’s popularity is based on the fact that it is based on an asset’s current volatility. Hence, it is an accurate reflection of the price action.
Most traders use the 3 ATR values as their preferred trailing stop-limit since it gives trades a sufficient distance to run. Let’s compare the different ATR values and how they respond to price changes.
The main advantage of the ATR trailing stop is that it moves with the price and locks in profits on open trades. It works well when automated, as it can work independently even when you are not monitoring your trades.
For example, you can use the ATR values on the hourly chart if you want to hold the trade intra-day or for a few days. You can switch to the ATR values on the daily chart if you plan to hold your trades for several days at the least, extending into a week or more.
YOUR CAPITAL IS AT RISK
1 ATR trailing stop-limit
You can see that you would have been stopped out of the trade very early and missed out on the rest of the trend.
2 ATR trailing stop-limit
The 2 ATR trailing stop distance is much better and would have kept you in the trade for much longer.
3 ATR trailing stop-loss distance
While the 3 ATR trailing stop-loss limit is much better, it would not have been enough to keep you in the trade for the entire duration.
YOUR CAPITAL IS AT RISK
3.5 ATR stop-loss distance
In this trade, a trailing stop-loss distance of 3.5 ATR values would have kept you in the trade for much longer, leading to your reaping the trade's maximum profits.
From the above charts, it is clear that the wider trailing stop-loss distance could have kept you in the trade for longer than the smaller ATR multiples.
Strategy 2: Moving Average (MA)
You can also use the moving average indicator as a trailing stop, given that it tracks the price of an asset very smoothly. The MA works in much the same way as the ATR indicator, but you cannot have multiple MA, as is the case with the ATR.
Most traders use the 20-period moving average or exponential moving average (EMA) to ride a trend up to exhaustion. Therefore, you can use the same setting to stay in a trending trade up until the trend is exhausted and the MA takes you out of the trade.
You can see that the MA trailing stop above would have kept you in the bullish trend on Alibaba stock, which started on October 24, 2019, and lasted for three months up to January 27, 2020.
You can automate your trailing stop-loss orders and limit orders by using Expert Advisors made to track changes in the ATR, the MA, and any other indicator you choose.
The main advantage of the ATR and MA trailing stop-loss indicators is that a spike in the price may cause them to be triggered, kicking you out of the trade. You could be taken out of a trade prematurely due to the spike since the ATR and MA are lagging indicators; hence, they will not react immediately to sudden price changes.
YOUR CAPITAL IS AT RISK
What Is a Good Percentage For a Trailing Stop-Loss Strategy?
A good trailing stop-loss percentage to use in this strategy is either 15% or 20%, which works most of the time for stocks. Another way to determine a trailing stop-loss distance is to use the stock's average volatility as a guide.
However, a 15% move in a currency pair is almost impossible as most currencies move about 0.5% – 2.0% daily. Therefore, the best way to set a trailing stop on a currency pair is to use pip values known as points, with most traders preferring to use 15-20 points (pips).
FAQs
A trailing stop-limit is an order that allows traders to set a limit to their losses while enabling them to reap maximum profits from their trades. A trailing stop-limit moves with the price when the market moves in your favour.
The trailing stop-limit order works by continually moving in line with the price if it is going in your chosen direction. However, the trailing stop-limit remains fixed if the price reverses and starts moving in the opposite direction. You will be taken out of the trade once the price hits the trailing stop-limit order.
A trailing stop-loss order is a market order that instructs your broker to close the trade once the price hits the specified level. However, a trailing stop-limit order requires the broker to close your position at the fixed price or better. A trailing stop-limit ensures that you get the price you requested or better, unlike a trailing stop-loss order, which could be filled at a worse price than you wanted.
The main difference between a stop-loss order and a trailing stop-loss is that a traditional stop is fixed, while a trailing stop moves with the asset’s price. The trailing stop also locks in your profit once the price moves in your favour, unlike the normal stop-loss, which remains fixed below or above your entry price at all times.

How to Use a Trailing Stop Loss (7 Ways to Lock in Profits)
Learn 7 proven ways to trail your stop loss to capture more profit. Also find out about the advantages and disadvantages of trailing a stop.
Last updated: March 31, 2024
By Hugh Kimura
Traders use a trailing stop loss to take advantage of trends and maximize their profit per trade.
In reality, nobody knows exactly when a trend will end.
Therefore, if you set take profit price, you'll lose out on a lot of profit if price keeps moving in the direction you expected.
A trailing stop loss will allow you to flow with the market and ride big moves.
Before I get into the actual methods, let's first look at the advantages and disadvantages of using trailing stop losses.
Advantages of Using a Trailing Stop Loss
The biggest advantage of using a trailing stop loss is that it gives you a systematic way of letting your profits run.
This has a huge psychological benefit.
SEE ALSO: The Trading Books That Changed My Life
If you don't have a plan, there can be the tendency to doubt yourself and feel like you missed out on profits.
In other words, you'll have FOMO, or the fear of missing out.
But when you have a tested plan, you know what to expect.
So even though one trade did not work out as well as you wanted, you know that over the course of many trades you'll make more money than if you didn't use the trailing stop.
Disadvantages of Using a Trailing Stop Loss
Using a trailing stop loss is not a guarantee that you'll make more money.
So you'll have to test a trailing stop with your entry, to see if it's a good fit.
A potential downside with trailing stops is that you'll give up some profits because you're exiting when price retraces.
This can be tough for some traders to handle on a psychological level.
Ask yourself if you don't mind giving up some short-term profit, in exchange for potentially gaining more profit on big moves.
Another disadvantage is that you might find that you break even more often.
There is always going to be a trade off between capturing more profit and having a higher win rate.
If you're the type of person who likes to have a high win rate, then trailing stops might not be for you.
However, you prefer to maximize your overall return and you don't mind a lower win rate, then you should totally look at using a trailing stop.
Now that you know the benefits and downsides, let's get into the proven methods that you can use.
1. Close Beyond a Moving Average
A close on the other side of a moving average is one of the easiest ways to trail your stop loss.
It's easy to spot a close beyond a moving average, so there's no room for overthinking or interpretation.
For example, let's say that you went short at the arrow on this chart.
You might have been tempted to exit on the first drop, or on the first retracement.
But by using a moving average as your trailing stop loss, you would have been able to capture more profits by waiting for a close above the moving average, as shown above.
Obviously, there are different types of moving averages and different settings.
If you don't know where to start, then you can test out these 3 settings and see how they work for you.
Backtest the different moving average settings and see which one is the most profitable.
Then don't be afraid to test out your own settings, based on your observations.
2. Risk Multiple Trailing Stop
Another trailing stop method that's not widely talked about, but can be very effective, is the risk multiple trailing stop.
The concept is simple, you trail your stop loss every time price gets to a multiple of your stop loss, in points.
For example, let's say that you had a 100 pip stop loss when you entered your trade.
This is the risk multiple, otherwise known as the R multiple.
In this case 1R is 100 pips.
So when price hits 100 pips in profit, you might want to trail your stop loss to breakeven.
From there, if price hits 200 pips of profit (2R), you maybe you trail your stop loss to 100 pips (1R) of profit.
That's a good place to start, but you can also experiment with using different risk multiples to move your stop loss.
You might move your stop to breakeven when price hits 2R.
…or you might want to start trailing your stop loss by 1R as soon as price hits 3R.
There are many possibilities for you to experiment with.
To take the work out of trailing your stop loss by R, our Trailing Stop EA for MetaTrader makes it easy.
It automatically sets up the trailings stop as soon as you enter a trade.
In this short trade example, the EA will move the stop loss to breakeven when price hits 2R, then trail the stop loss by 1R when price hits 4R.
The best part about this method is that it automatically takes market volatility into account.
If the market is volatile, the stop loss will be wider and the R levels will be wider.
Then you can ride out volatile spikes more easily.
When the market is quiet, the stop loss will be smaller and price has to move less to hit your R levels and start locking in profits.
3. Moving Average Crossover
When moving averages cross, that can be a good indication that a trend is coming to an end.
A popular moving average crossover trading strategy is the Golden/Death Cross.
This is usually used to trade stock market indexes, but it can also be used in other markets.
The best part about this trailing stop method is that it's very exact.
It's obvious when the moving averages cross.
There's no analysis or discretion involved.
As soon as you have a closing candle with a crossover, you exit the trade.
4. Support and Resistance
Support and resistance levels can be great ways to trail your stop.
These levels take into account the current volatility of the markets and are usually easy to spot.
Here's an example of how trail your stop loss in this downtrend in the EURUSD.
The only real downside to using this method is that there is some discretion involved when drawing support and resistance levels.
You have to be patient and let the support levels develop, or you can move your stop loss too early and get stopped out prematurely.
To prevent this, look for a strong move away from a level before moving your stop loss.
5. Parabolic SAR (PSAR)
If you prefer indicators, the PSAR is another easy way to trail your stop loss.
This indicator provides clear levels to set your stop loss on every candle.
In the chart below, the PSAR dots are the levels where you would place your trailing stop loss.
Traders will usually trail their stop loss by 2 or 3 previous levels so they can ride the trend.
On the downside, the PSAR may not capture a long term trend because it tends to be a little more sensitive than other trailing stop loss methods.
In order to compensate for this, you can make the settings less sensitive, or use the indicator on a higher timeframe.
For example, you might be trading on the 4 hour chart, but you could use the PSAR on the daily chart to trail your stop loss.
6. 3-Candle Exit
This method trails your stop loss fairly tightly, so it's great for markets that tend to have strong breakouts, but price snaps back quickly.
Here's how it works…
Once your trade is in profit, trail your stop loss in the following way:
Move your stop loss with every new candle that prints.
As you can see, your stop loss moves with price, which allows you to take advantage of big candles.
But as soon as price starts consolidating or retracing, you are stopped out and you take your profits off the table.
Here's an example of a short trade.
This short trade is in profit, so it's time to start trailing the stop loss.
At the current candle, you count 3 candles back.
Then place the stop loss above the 3rd candle.
As each new candle closes, the 3rd candle also moves forward and you move your stop loss accordingly.
Easy, right?!
7. Percentage Retracement
The final method that I want to share with you in this tutorial is to exit a trade after price has retraced by a certain percentage of the high or low of the move.
This method is a little different from the others above, in that you're using the last extreme move.
So let's say that you determine that when price retraces 12%, that's a good time to exit the trade.
Here's a long example, where price has retraced 13% from the high of the move at 86.38.
If you used a percent retracement trailing stop, you would have exited just before price moved lower to 70.
In order figure out the best retracement setting to use, be sure to do extensive backtesting in the market that you're trading.
This method is usually used in the stock market, but test it out in the market you trade.
Remember that every market has its own personality, just like us humans.
So each individual market and even each currency pair or stock might need to use a different retracement setting.
Trailing Stops You Shouldn't Use
Knowing which trailing stop methods to avoid is just as important as knowing which ones to use.
There are 2 common trailing stop loss methods that you should avoid.
Fixed Point Value
The first method that is sometimes taught online is to trail the stop loss by a fixed point value.
So let's say that you set a trailing stop value of 25 pips.
Every time price moves 25 pips, you move your stop loss 25 pips to lock in your profits.
This sounds great in theory and it's easy to implement.
However, it does not take into account the volatility in the market you're trading.
If you trade a lower volatility pair like the EURGBP, then 25 pips might work well.
But if you trade a more volatile pair like the GBPJPY, then 25 pips will probably be too small and you'll get stopped out a lot.
The bottom line is to avoid using a fixed value trailing stop.
Built-in Trailing Stop on Trading Platforms
Some trading platforms, especially Forex platforms, have a built-in trailing stop feature and some new traders might be tempted to use it.
This is actually one of the worst ways to trail a stop loss.
Here's why…
The trailing stop loss on trading platforms usually trails your stop loss by fixed point value and trails it on every tick.
As I demonstrated above, using a fixed point value by itself is not useful because it does not take into account the current volatility of the market.
But using a tick-by-tick trailing stop is even worse.
When you use this type of trailing stop, the stop loss starts trailing as soon as the trade moves in a positive direction.
Even if the trade isn't profitable yet.
Again, that might sound great in theory.
But the reality is that this type of trailing stop “strangles” the trade too quickly and you'll usually find yourself getting stopped out at a small loss, or having just a small profit and missing out on a big move.
So avoid this type of trailing stop loss and test out the methods on the list above.
Which Trailing Stop Strategy is Best?
In reality, there's no one best trailing stop loss strategy for everyone.
Your trailing stop method has to be a good fit with your entry and your trading personality.
Therefore, the best way to start implementing a trailing stop is to get data on your current trading strategy without a trailing stop.
Knowing these stats will give you a baseline to compare with your strategy with a trailing stop.
Assuming your test is profitable, then test different trailing stop methods with your entry.
The data will tell you which trailing stop method is best to use.
Final Thoughts
So there are 7 trailing stop loss methods that can increase your average profit per trade by letting your winners run.
Sometimes the improvement in your return can be dramatic when you add a trailing stop.
But like with all things in trading, be sure to test your trailing stop method extensively before you risk real money.
The strategy you use has to match your entry and your trading personality.
Try a few different trailing exits, get some stats and pick the one that works best for you.
Also explore other trailing stop methods not mentioned in this tutorial.
Have fun!

Starting out in trading requires an understanding of key terms, such as trailing stop loss, to make the journey smoother. Trailing stop losses combine trading and risk management techniques to protect profits. However, novice traders often misuse the tool, resulting in limitations.
While trailing stops can lower risk, they can also restrict profit potential. It’s important to consider them as a risk management strategy but keep in mind that they may reduce profit potential. In this guide, we’ll outline the pros and cons to help you gain a clearer understanding of the strategy.
What is a trailing stop loss?
Understanding how a trailing stop works is critical to managing risk and maximizing profits in trading. A stop-loss order is a fundamental risk management tool used to prevent losses by specifying when a trade should be closed if the price moves against you. The primary benefit of a stop-loss is the ability to limit losses, ensuring that you don’t lose more than you’re willing to risk. These orders remain active until the position is liquidated or the order is canceled.
A trailing stop, on the other hand, is a more sophisticated tool that combines trading and risk management techniques to optimize profits. A trailing stop-loss is a type of market order that sets a stop-loss at a percentage below the market price of an asset, rather than a fixed number. By trailing the stop loss at a specific percentage below the market price, traders can lock in profits while leaving the trade open until the asset’s value reaches the trailing stop level. This means that if the asset’s price rises, the stop will automatically adjust to the new higher price, ensuring that profits are locked in, and the trade is closed if the price drops back to the stop level.
While such kind of stops have significant advantages, they can also be restrictive if used incorrectly. Novice traders may misuse trailing stops by applying them without fully comprehending how they work, which may result in limitations to their trading strategies. Additionally, trailing stops are highly risk-averse, which means that the profit potential of a stop loss may be significantly reduced.
In summary, a trailing stop is a valuable tool for traders, but it’s important to understand its pros and cons. By using it, you can maximize profits while managing risk effectively, but it’s crucial to apply the tool correctly to avoid unnecessary limitations to your trading strategies.
How do trailing stops work?
The age-old trading proverb of “let your profits run, cut your losses short” can be effectively followed by using the trailing stop technique. As the name suggests, orders trail the market prices by a specific amount.
When you use a this stop type, it rises along with the market price when your trade is in profit. This means that as the market moves in your favor, the proportion of loss you are willing to accept remains constant.
If the market eventually turns against you, the trailing stop, which has increased in proportion to your profit, helps to safeguard your recent gains. By using them, you can maximize your profits while limiting your losses, which is an essential aspect of successful trading.
How to set a trailing stop loss?
To start using this stop-loss order type, you should set a specific number of points or a percentage distance from the initial price. When the market price hits your trailing stop, the stop-loss order will be triggered, and your transaction will be terminated.
Here’s an example to help you understand how it works. Suppose you set a stop-loss distance of 0.50 with a current price of $10. In that case, the trigger price for your trailing stop will be $9.5 initially. As the asset’s current price increases by $0.1, the stop will also rise while keeping the 0.50 distance.
Using the same example, when the price rises to $10.5, our stop-loss order will rise to $10. This is an instance of an automated stop loss. Alternatively, you can also establish a manual adjustment stop loss.
Some traders prefer trail the stops manually as it offers them more control over when the stop-loss is adjusted. In this case, the order placed with the brokerage isn’t a trailing stop-loss order, but a regular stop-loss order.
Using the Trade Panel to set up a trailing stop-loss has several advantages over manually setting a stop-loss. Firstly, it saves time and effort as the trader doesn’t have to monitor the market continuously. The Trade Panel automates the process, which allows traders to concentrate on other aspects of trading, such as analyzing market trends and making trading decisions.
Additionally, the Trade Panel allows traders to customize their stop-loss settings according to their risk management plans. This feature helps traders to have a more structured approach to trading, which can result in better risk management and improved profitability. Overall, using the Trade Panel for trailing stop-losses can save time, reduce stress, and improve trading performance.
Trailing stop loss example
Let’s use a real-world example of a forex pair to illustrate this stop-loss order type.
Placing a 50-pip trailing stop on EUR/USD after buying it at 1.1850 means that if the price climbs to 1.1900, your stop will move from 1.1800 to 1.1850. (50 pips).
Unless the market rises another 50 pips in your favor, your stop will remain at 1.1850. This implies that your trade will be open as long as the price does not move 50 pips against you.
Should you use a trailing stop loss?
Trailing stops are a useful tool when you have a winning trade and want to keep it going in the direction you intended while also securing your gains in case it turns against you.
Although stops are intended to protect your capital, placing them too aggressively near the price can gradually deplete your account as you get stopped out repeatedly.
It’s essential to keep in mind that trailing stops can only move in your favor; if the market moves against you, the stop will remain fixed at its previous level.
Disadvantages of a trailing stop loss
Trailing stops have become a popular strategy among traders, and for good reason. They allow you to protect your gains in a profitable trade by locking in profits as the price moves in your favor. However, like any strategy, trailing stops come with their own set of drawbacks and limitations that traders need to be aware of. In this response, we’ll discuss some of the disadvantages of using trailing stop loss orders.
Trailing stop losses are hard to determine
One of the biggest challenges of using trailing stops is determining the right distance to place your stop order. If you set it too far away, you risk losing a significant portion of your profits if the price suddenly reverses. On the other hand, if you set it too close, you risk getting stopped out prematurely in a volatile market.
Furthermore, prices can sometimes make a quick, abrupt move that triggers your trailing stop loss order but then continue in the desired direction without you. If you hadn’t modified the original stop-loss with a trailing order, you might still be in the trade and profiting from positive price movements.
There’s no guarantee
Another issue with trailing stops is that there’s no guarantee that you’ll get the price of your stop-loss order. In fast-moving markets, such as during periods of high volatility, the asset value can decrease rapidly, and your order may not be executed at the stop price you specified. This can force you to sell at a lower price than you anticipated, resulting in a loss.
Volatility disrupts trailing stop losses
Trailing stop-loss orders can be particularly challenging to use with volatile assets. If you set the order too low to account for anticipated swings, you risk suffering large losses. However, if you set it too high, you may end up selling the asset against your will during natural market fluctuations at a time when it would be preferable to keep it.
Gapping is a term used to describe a situation in which the price of your asset passes through the price of your trailing stop loss order without you being sold out. Gapping can occur at the market opening when the price starts significantly lower than it closed the night before, but it is more common during periods of high market volatility. This is exactly when you need a trailing stop loss order to protect you.
Trailing stops don’t work in all conditions
Trailing stops can result in many lost trades during periods when the price isn’t moving well. When this happens, traders can choose to either not trade or adopt a set-and-forget strategy. The set-and-forget strategy involves setting a stop and target depending on current market circumstances and then letting the price hit one trading order or the other one without making any modifications.
Moreover, the forex market is known to trade in ranges for over sixty or sixty-five percent of the time. Therefore, trends like the one shown here on the EURUSD don’t happen very often. Trailing stops won’t assist in such cases. Rather than closing the entire position when the market reaches the calculated move, traders may book only half of the possible profit, only to have the market reverse and “eat” the other half.
There’s no exact distance
The optimal distance for a trailing stop loss is constantly shifting because markets and asset movements are always changing. A larger trailing stop is a better bet during more turbulent periods, while a tighter trailing stop loss may be useful during calmer times or in a highly steady market. However, it can be frustrating for traders to constantly adjust their trailing stop orders based on market conditions.
Accessibility
Depending on the online brokerage you use, the investments you may employ a trailing stop loss strategy with may be limited. Some online brokerages do not enable stop-loss trading at all. Therefore, traders should research and find an online brokerage that allows for trailing stop-loss orders to be placed.
Manual adjustment in MT4 and MT5
If you use the MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5 trading platforms, you must adjust the trailing stops manually. However, in TradingKit we have developed a Trade Panel that can do the work for you. It has various settings for trailing stop losses and helps a lot to simplify the trading routine.
Not ideal for day trading and scalping
Trailing stops must be used with caution when day trading or scalping. Currency pairs can cycle up and down before moving in their final direction in the forex market, which is known as whipsaw. This becomes more important when you are a scalper because you have to make trading decisions quickly, and the price can be volatile. If you place a tight stop close to your price and the price whips back and forth, your trailing stop is most likely to be hit.
Can lead to irrational decisions
Active trading can be stressful as traders must make decisions in real-time with each price change. Should you stay or should you leave? Is it possible to move the trailing stop? Do you want to change the profit target? Because discipline, like a muscle, may get exhausted under such stress, it can lead to bad trading judgments.
In conclusion, while trailing stops can be useful in certain situations, they also have several disadvantages that traders should be aware of. It is essential to understand how trailing stops work and the conditions under which they are most effective. Traders should also have a solid trading plan and risk management strategy in place before using trailing stops to help minimize their risks.
Are there any advantages of a trailing stop loss?
Despite the disadvantages mentioned earlier, there are numerous advantages to using trailing stops as a risk management tool in trading. Let’s take a closer look at some of them:
In summary, while there are some disadvantages to using trailing stops, the benefits of this risk management tool make it a valuable addition to any trader’s arsenal.
How to place a trailing stop loss like a pro?
If you want to set a trailing stop-loss like a pro, it’s important to consider a few factors.
First, you should assess whether this kind of a stop-loss is appropriate for the currency pair you are trading, particularly if it is highly volatile with unpredictable price movements. However, keep in mind that increased volatility could lead to the stop-loss being triggered earlier than anticipated.
To place the trailing stop-loss effectively, you should carefully evaluate the pair’s past performance as well as current market conditions. It’s important to consider the market’s volatility over a longer time frame, as well as its daily behavior. Setting the stop-loss too close to the market price may result in an early exit, while placing it too far away could increase your risk exposure.
If you’re buying a pair, you should place your trailing stop-loss below the current market price. Conversely, if you’re selling, the stop-loss should be placed above the market price. By following these guidelines, you can help to manage your risk and potentially maximize your profits when using a trailing stop-loss.
Professional traders often focus on making trading decisions rather than spending time on routine tasks such as manually managing trades. This is why they rely on software like Trade Panel to automate these activities and allow the program to handle them. Another helpful tool is the Risk Manager, which can also control risks and stops and keep risk management under control. By using these tools, traders can free up their time and energy to focus on making more informed and profitable trading decisions.
Final thoughts
In conclusion, using a trailing stop-loss is a popular strategy in trading, but it comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. It can be useful in capturing big market moves, but it may also result in losses during times of low volatility.
To use this strategy effectively, it is essential to carefully consider the market conditions and the appropriate placement of the stop-loss order as well as automate it using software like Trade Panel. It is also crucial to test any trailing stop-loss strategy in a demo account before implementing it in a live trading environment. With practice and experience, traders can develop a successful trailing stop-loss strategy that fits their trading style and risk management plan.

Online brokers are constantly on the lookout for ways to limit investor losses. One of the most common downside protection mechanisms is an exit strategy known as a stop-loss order, where if a share price dips to a certain level the position will be automatically sold at the current market price to stem further losses.
Key Takeaways
Trailing Stops
Traders can enhance the efficacy of a stop-loss by pairing it with a trailing stop, which is a trade order where the stop-loss price isn't fixed at a single, absolute dollar amount, but is rather set at a certain percentage or dollar amount below the market price.
Here's how it works. When the price increases, it drags the trailing stop along with it. Then when the price finally stops rising, the new stop-loss price remains at the level it was dragged to, thus automatically protecting an investor's downside, while locking in profits as the price reaches new highs. Trailing stops may be used with stock, options, and futures exchanges that support traditional stop-loss orders.
Workings of a Trailing Stop
To better understand how a trailing stop works, consider a stock with the following data:
If the market price climbs to $10.97, your trailing stop value will rise to $10.77. If the last price now drops to $10.90, your stop value will remain intact at $10.77. If the price continues to drop, this time to $10.76, it will penetrate your stop-level, immediately triggering a market order.
Your order would be submitted based on the last price of $10.76. Assuming that the bid price was $10.75 at the time, the position would be closed at this point and price. The net gain would be $0.75 per share, less commissions, of course.
During momentary price dips, it's crucial to resist the impulse to reset your trailing stop, or else your effective stop-loss may end up lower than expected. By the same token, reining in a trailing stop-loss is advisable when you see momentum peaking in the charts, especially when the stock is hitting a new high.
Revisiting the aforementioned example, when the last price hits $10.80, a trader can tighten the trailing stop from $0.20 to $0.11, allowing for some flexibility in the stock's price movement, while ensuring that the stop is triggered before a substantial pullback can occur. Shrewd traders maintain the option of closing a position at any time by submitting a sell order at the market.
The Best of Both Worlds
When combining traditional stop-losses with trailing stops, it's important to calculate your maximum risk tolerance. For example, you could set a stop-loss at 2% below the current stock price and the trailing stop at 2.5% below the current stock price. As share price increases, the trailing stop will surpass the fixed stop-loss, rendering it redundant or obsolete.
Any further price increases will mean further minimizing potential losses with each upward price tick. The added protection is that the trailing stop will only move up, where, during market hours, the trailing feature will consistently recalculate the stop's trigger point.
Using the Trailing Stop/Stop-Loss Combo on Active Trades
Trailing stops are more difficult to employ with active trades, due to price fluctuations and the volatility of certain stocks, especially during the first hour of the trading day. Then again, such fast-moving stocks typically attract traders, because of their potential to generate substantial amounts of money in a short time. Consider the following stock example:
Image by Sabrina Jiang Â© Investopedia 2020
In the chart above, we see a stock in a steady uptrend, as determined by strong lines in the moving averages. Keep in mind that all stocks seem to experience resistance at a price ending in "".00m"" and also at "".50,"" although not as strongly. It's as if traders are reluctant to take it to the next dollar level.
Our sample stock is Stock Z, which was purchased at $90.13 with a stop-loss at $89.70 and an initial trailing stop of $0.49. When the last price reached $90.21, the stop-loss was canceled, as the trailing stop took over. As the last price reached $90.54, the trailing stop was tightened to $0.40, with the intent of securing a breakeven trade in a worst-case scenario.
As the price pushed steadily toward $92, it was time to tighten the stop. When the last price reached $91.97, the trailing stop was tightened to $0.25 from $0.40. The price dipped to $91.48 on small profit-taking, and all shares were sold at an average price of $91.70. The profit (before commissions) was $942, or 1.74%.
For this strategy to work on active trades, you must set a trailing stop value that will accommodate normal price fluctuations for the particular stock and catch only the true pullback in price. This can be achieved by thoroughly studying a stock for several days before actively trading it.
Next, you must be able to time your trade by looking at an analog clock and noting the angle of the long arm when it is pointing between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., which you'll want to use as your guide. Now, when your favorite moving average is holding steady at this angle, stay with your initial trailing stop loss. As the moving average changes direction, dropping below 2 p.m., it's time to tighten your trailing stop spread (see above chart).
The trailing stop/stop-loss combo eliminates the emotional component from trading, letting you rationally make measured decisions based on statistical information.
Trader Risk
Traders face certain risks in using stop-losses. For starters, market makers are keenly aware of any stop-losses you place with your broker and can force a whipsaw in the price, thereby bumping you out of your position, then running the price right back up again.
Also, in the case of a trailing stop, there looms the possibility of setting it too tight during the early stages of the stock garnering its support. In this case, the result will be the same, where the stop will be triggered by a temporary price pullback, leaving traders to fret over a perceived loss. This can be a tough psychological pill to swallow.
What Are Trailing Stops Used for?
A trailing stop is often used by traders who want to either lock their profits to the upside or to prevent extending losses to the downside.
Is It Better to Set a Trailing Stop As a Percentage or Fixed Amount?
In general, most traders favor percentages for trailing stops since they are better able to reconcile changes across different securities (e.g., $1 may be a 10% move in one stock but less than 1% in another). But, to lock in a specific dollar amount of a trade, you may prefer to utilize a fixed price trailing stop.
Why Are Trailing Stops Effective?
Trailing stops are effective because they allow a trade to stay open and continue to profit as long as the price is moving in the investor’s favor. This may help some traders cope psychologically with volatile markets.
The Bottom Line
Although there are significant risks involved with using trailing stops, combining them with traditional stop-losses can go a long way toward minimizing losses and protecting profits.

Understanding the Ring and Its Components
Before diving into wrestling techniques, it's important to understand the ring and its components. The ring is a circular mat that measures 32 feet in diameter and is surrounded by a circle of foam padding. The center of the ring is marked by a small circle, which is used to start the match.
The mat itself is made of durable material that provides traction for wrestlers while also providing a soft landing surface. The foam padding that surrounds the ring is designed to protect wrestlers from injury if they are thrown out of the ring. It's important to note that the foam padding is not considered part of the ring, so wrestlers must stay within the boundaries of the mat in order to avoid being disqualified.
In addition to the ring and its components, there are several other key elements to wrestling, including rules and regulations, scoring, and weight classes. Understanding these elements is crucial for success in wrestling, regardless of your skill level.
Basic Wrestling Techniques - Stance and Footwork
The foundation of wrestling is proper stance and footwork. A good stance is essential for balance and control, while proper footwork is crucial for movement and agility. Here's a breakdown of the basic wrestling stance and footwork:
Stance: The basic wrestling stance involves standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and weight evenly distributed between both feet. Your head should be up, your back straight, and your hands should be held in front of you, ready to grapple.
Footwork: In wrestling, footwork is used to create angles and set up takedowns. The most common footwork techniques include the slide step, the crossover step, and the pivot step. The slide step involves stepping forward with one foot and then sliding the other foot forward to maintain your stance. The crossover step involves crossing one foot over the other and then stepping forward to create an angle. Finally, the pivot step involves pivoting on one foot to create an angle and then stepping forward with the other foot.
By mastering these basic techniques, you'll be well on your way to becoming a skilled wrestler.
Takedowns - Single Leg, Double Leg, High Crotch, and More
Takedowns are a key component of wrestling and involve taking your opponent down to the mat while maintaining control. There are several types of takedowns, including the single leg, double leg, and high crotch, among others. Here's a breakdown of each takedown:
Single Leg: The single leg takedown involves grabbing one of your opponent's legs and lifting it off the mat, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with one foot and reach down to grab your opponent's leg just above the ankle. Pull their leg towards you while pushing them off balance with your other hand, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.
Double Leg: The double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent's legs and lifting them off the mat, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with both feet and reach down to grab both of your opponent's legs just above the ankles. Pull their legs towards you while pushing them off balance with your hands, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.
High Crotch: The high crotch takedown involves grabbing your opponent's leg and lifting it up to your side, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with one foot and reach down to grab your opponent's leg just above the knee. Lift their leg up to your side, while at the same time pushing them off balance with your other hand, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.
By mastering these takedowns and others, you'll be able to take control of your opponent and dominate the match.

Relentlessly get to your feet Bottom Position. Do: Relentlessly get to your feet and know solid leg defense. Don't: Roll around and rely on trick moves. Stand ups won't always work, but they will often create the action that is needed to get away from tougher opponents. 4.","How to Win a Wrestling Match Every Time: 7 Ways To Increase Match Toughness
Want to know how to win a wrestling match every time? I am all about giving wrestlers concrete tasks to follow rather than abstract concepts.  Finding a way to measure mental toughness and grit is a necessity if you wish to teach it to the masses.  With this in mind, I came up with 7 situations that win and lose close matches and I regularly remind my wrestlers they need to win these situations, every time, if they want to learn to wrestle to dominate and beat great opponents.
Teach your wrestlers to win these situations and execute the proper game plan in these positions and watch their success rate skyrocket.
Warning:  These are the right ways to wrestle, not the easiest.  There will be hard work involved.
So here you go…
1. Lift & Return When an Opponent Stands Up From Bottom.
Do: Lift and ReturnDon’t: Pull them on top of you, Release them easily or drop to their legs and hold on. The Lift-n-Return is one of the prettiest moves in wrestling. You know you’re watching a tough wrestler when they relentless lift and return from the top. If you want to let your opponent go and they stand up on you, I suggest you lift-n-return and then release.  Be sure they know they didn’t earn the point… You gave it to them.
2. Constant Forward Pressure on The Top position
Do: Keep constant forward pressure while working for breakdowns and turns.Don’t: Try to hang on or float on top of your opponentThe best rides are all executed with toes dug in the mat and grinding pressure. Even if you don’t get the turn your goal is to let them know who is in charge and get inside their head when you’re on top. MANY close matches are won by not letting your opponent out from the bottom or wearing them out with a tough grinding ride.
3.
Relentlessly get to your feet Bottom Position
Do: Relentlessly get to your feet and know solid leg defense.Don’t: Roll around and rely on trick moves.Stand ups won’t always work, but they will often create the action that is needed to get away from tougher opponents.
4. Solid Shot Defense
Do: Square hips, toe down on the feet, and look to clear leg(s) to Front HeadlocksDon’t: Give away angles, sit to your butt or let them lift you.Ideally, nobody should get to your legs but the fact is it is going to happen. Give your opponent as little as possible and look to score off their leg attacks. Train yourself to use the most fundamental shot defense techniques and you won’t give up as many takedowns and you will save yourself from injury.
5. Never watch the clock
Do: Listen to your coach for updates and train yourself to wrestle hard until you hear the whistleDon’t: Never look to the clock in a close match during any action.Train yourself to wrestle harder at the end of periods no matter what the score is.
6. Win The Last 20 seconds of every period
Do: Win these short goes or at least break evenDon’t: Never lose the last 20 secondsGet the take down, escape or reversal when in the neutral or bottom position. Keep your opponent down or develop a safe & reliable quick turn to score with when on top. Never, get taken down or let an opponent escape or reverse you in the last 20 seconds of a period.
7. When On the leg(s) from a shot
Do: Get to your feet and finish, escape the weight, and finish or clear out.Don’t: drop to your haunches, hold on or stand still on your feet.Ideally, a wrestler will maintain continuous motion from set up to shot through the finish. But realistically many wrestlers get caught under their opponents and they needa strategy to deal with this.  If you follow these rules all the time, no matter what the score is, you will learn to wrestle to dominate. Being relentless with your attacks and extremely stingy are the keys to wrestling success. Master these positions and scenarios and find yourself winning a lot more close matches and feeling opponents break as the match goes on.
If you follow these rules all the time, no matter what the score is, you will learn to wrestle to dominate.  Being relentless with your attacks and extremely stingy are two major keys to wrestling success.  Master these positions and scenarios and find yourself winning a lot more close matches and feeling opponents break as the match goes on.

Coach, I like how you highlight being “stingy.”
Certainly not to be confused with being defensive, something too many wrestlers are, especially in a close match.
Not giving up points is every bit as important as being able to score and often more demoralizing to a tough opponent.
Great points!
Thanks.
Great tips and worth the effort to implement drills to highlight these situations. It is refreshing to hear some of the items I was taught many years ago still apply.
Thank you for sharing.
Absolutely agree with coach daryl about looking at a clock during a match. If you had a great coach as I did then you would definitely agree also.
I really like the lift and return method, it seems like it would really help with confidence and getting inside your opponents head but not sure how feasible it will be to teach it to q 7th grader that that weighs 225 and wrestles 235 weight class we’re going to
try it tomorrow at practice I’ll let you know how it goes.
Great advice.
These are good points , though am a bit too old to wrestle per se these are excellent good pointers
I do strongly agree with these rules, getting wrestlers to train this way can be challenging.
Kevin Juedes

Before diving into wrestling techniques, it's important to understand the ring and its components. The ring is a circular mat that measures 32 feet in diameter and is surrounded by a circle of foam padding. The center of the ring is marked by a small circle, which is used to start the match.
The mat itself is made of durable material that provides traction for wrestlers while also providing a soft landing surface. The foam padding that surrounds the ring is designed to protect wrestlers from injury if they are thrown out of the ring. It's important to note that the foam padding is not considered part of the ring, so wrestlers must stay within the boundaries of the mat in order to avoid being disqualified.
In addition to the ring and its components, there are several other key elements to wrestling, including rules and regulations, scoring, and weight classes. Understanding these elements is crucial for success in wrestling, regardless of your skill level.

In this comprehensive guide, we will provide you with all the information you need to comprehend the intricacies of this exciting sport. Whether you are a novice or a seasoned wrestler, this article will break down the key components of the freestyle wrestling scoring system, including takedowns, exposure points, and penalty points. Stay tuned to unlock the secrets behind how matches are scored and gain valuable insights into this captivating aspect of freestyle wrestling.
Overview of the Freestyle Wrestling Scoring System
Basic rules and objectives
In freestyle wrestling, the scoring system is designed to determine the winner of a match based on the performance and technique displayed by the wrestlers. The objective is to execute various moves and maneuvers to gain points, ultimately aiming to defeat the opponent by earning a higher score. Understanding the basic rules and objectives of the freestyle wrestling scoring system is crucial for both wrestlers and spectators.
The primary goal in freestyle wrestling is to pin the opponent’s shoulders to the mat, which results in an immediate victory. However, since pinning is not always achieved, points are awarded for successfully executing different moves and actions during the match. These points contribute to the overall score, which determines the winner if a pin does not occur.
Key components of scoring
The freestyle wrestling scoring system consists of three main components: takedowns, exposure, and reversals. Each of these components offers opportunities for wrestlers to earn points based on their actions and effectiveness in executing specific techniques.
Takedowns: A takedown occurs when a wrestler manages to bring their opponent down to the mat from a standing position while maintaining control. This action is rewarded with two points. Takedowns showcase a wrestler’s ability to overpower their opponent and establish dominance.
Exposure: Exposure refers to the act of exposing an opponent’s back to the mat. If a wrestler manages to expose their opponent’s back, even momentarily, they earn points based on the duration and control of the exposure. The longer the exposure and the more control exerted, the higher the points awarded.
Reversals: Reversals occur when a wrestler successfully escapes the control of their opponent while being in a disadvantaged position. This maneuver demonstrates a wrestler’s ability to turn the tables and gain control. Reversals are awarded with one point.
By understanding these key components of scoring, wrestlers can strategize their moves and techniques to accumulate points throughout the match. The constant pursuit of scoring opportunities adds excitement and intensity to freestyle wrestling matches.
Different weight categories
Freestyle wrestling encompasses various weight categories to ensure fair competition among athletes of similar size and strength. These weight categories range from the lightest to the heaviest, allowing wrestlers to compete against opponents who match their physical attributes and capabilities.
The International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) has established specific weight divisions for freestyle wrestling competitions. These divisions may vary slightly depending on the governing body, but they generally consist of weight ranges such as lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight.
Wrestlers competing in different weight categories face opponents who possess similar body mass and strength, reducing potential disadvantages due to significant differences in size. This classification system ensures that matches remain competitive and provide equal opportunities for wrestlers across various weight divisions.
In conclusion, the freestyle wrestling scoring system is designed to reward wrestlers for their skills, techniques, and ability to gain control over their opponents. By understanding the basic rules and objectives, key components of scoring, and the significance of weight categories, both wrestlers and spectators can better appreciate the intricacies of this dynamic sport.
Understanding Takedowns and Exposures
Definition and types of takedowns
Takedowns are a crucial aspect of freestyle wrestling and play a significant role in determining the outcome of a match. They involve successfully bringing an opponent from a standing position to the mat while maintaining control. There are various types of takedowns that wrestlers employ to gain points and dominance in a match.
Single Leg Takedown: This takedown involves grabbing one of the opponent’s legs and lifting it while driving them to the mat. It is a widely used technique due to its effectiveness and versatility.
Double Leg Takedown: In this technique, a wrestler shoots in on their opponent, driving both arms around both legs, and lifts them off the mat before taking them down. It is a powerful move that can quickly secure points.
High-Crotch Takedown: This takedown involves grabbing the opponent’s leg while keeping your head on the same side. It allows for control and leverage, making it an effective technique.
Fireman’s Carry: The fireman’s carry is a complex move that requires agility and timing. It involves controlling the opponent’s arm and shoulder before lifting them onto your back and taking them down.
Scoring criteria for takedowns
In freestyle wrestling, takedowns are awarded points based on specific criteria. The scoring criteria for takedowns are as follows:
2-Point Takedown: A wrestler earns two points when they successfully execute a takedown, bringing their opponent from a standing position to the mat while maintaining control.
Exposing the Opponent: If a wrestler performs a takedown and manages to expose their opponent’s back to the mat, they are awarded additional points. This could be achieved by tilting or turning the opponent, exposing their back at an angle of 45 degrees or less.
Additional Points for Exposure: When a wrestler exposes their opponent’s back to the mat, they can earn either two or four additional points, depending on the duration of exposure. If the exposure lasts for less than five seconds, two points are awarded, whereas if it lasts for five seconds or more, four points are granted.
Exposures and their significance
Exposures are critical moments in a freestyle wrestling match that can significantly impact the score. When a wrestler manages to expose their opponent’s back to the mat, it demonstrates dominance and control, resulting in valuable points. Exposures not only increase the wrestler’s score but also put their opponent at a disadvantage, psychologically and strategically.
By effectively executing takedowns and capitalizing on exposures, wrestlers can accumulate points, establish dominance, and increase their chances of winning a match. Understanding the different types of takedowns, the scoring criteria, and the significance of exposures are essential for both wrestlers and spectators to fully grasp the dynamics and excitement of the freestyle wrestling scoring system.
Exploring Reversals, Escapes, and Penalty Points
Reversals and their scoring
In the intense and dynamic sport of freestyle wrestling, reversals play a crucial role in determining the outcome of a match. A reversal occurs when a wrestler who is in a disadvantaged position manages to gain control over their opponent. This not only awards them points but also shifts the momentum of the match in their favor.
In terms of scoring, a reversal is worth two points in freestyle wrestling. It is essential for wrestlers to master the art of reversals as it can serve as a game-changer, allowing them to turn the tables on their opponent and potentially secure a victory. By executing a well-timed and skillful reversal, a wrestler can not only score points but also gain a psychological advantage over their adversary.
Escapes and their importance
Escapes are another significant aspect of the freestyle wrestling scoring system. An escape occurs when a wrestler successfully breaks free from their opponent’s control and gains a neutral position. While it may not award any points directly, an escape is crucial as it enables a wrestler to regain control over the match and potentially set up for a scoring opportunity.
Escapes are particularly valuable when a wrestler finds themselves in a disadvantageous position, such as being pinned down or locked in a hold by their opponent. By executing a swift and strategic escape, a wrestler can neutralize their opponent’s advantage and reset the dynamics of the match. This not only helps in preventing their opponent from scoring but also allows them to launch their own offensive moves and potentially secure points.
Penalty points and their impact
In freestyle wrestling, penalty points are awarded to a wrestler’s opponent when they commit rule violations or engage in unsportsmanlike conduct. Penalty points play a significant role in the scoring system as they can greatly influence the outcome of a match.
Depending on the severity of the violation, penalty points can range from one to four points. These points are awarded to the wrestler’s opponent, providing them with a substantial advantage in terms of scoring. Therefore, it is crucial for wrestlers to maintain discipline, adhere to the rules, and avoid any actions that may result in penalty points being awarded against them.
Penalty points not only affect the overall score but also impact the psyche of the penalized wrestler. They can create frustration, distraction, and even a sense of urgency to make up for the lost points. Wrestlers must strive to avoid penalty points by maintaining control, executing clean moves, and demonstrating good sportsmanship throughout the match.
Understanding the scoring system of freestyle wrestling, including the significance of reversals, escapes, and penalty points, is essential for both wrestlers and spectators. These elements contribute to the complexity and excitement of the sport, making every match a thrilling and strategic battle on the mat.
Analyzing Criteria for Pinning and Technical Superiority
Pinning techniques and rules
In freestyle wrestling, pinning is a crucial component of the scoring system. A pin occurs when one wrestler is able to hold both of their opponent’s shoulder blades simultaneously on the mat for a specified period of time. This feat requires a combination of skill, strength, and technique. There are various pinning techniques that wrestlers employ to secure a win.
One commonly used pinning technique is the double shoulder pin, where a wrestler applies pressure on both shoulders of their opponent, preventing them from escaping. Another technique is the arm bar, where a wrestler immobilizes their opponent’s arm by applying pressure in a way that restricts their movement and puts them in a vulnerable position for a pin.
However, it is important to note that there are specific rules governing pinning in freestyle wrestling. For a pin to be valid, the shoulders of the opponent must be in contact with the mat, and the pinning wrestler must have control over their opponent. If the pinning wrestler loses control or if any part of their own body touches the mat, the pin is considered invalid, and the match continues.
Understanding technical superiority
Technical superiority is another way to win a freestyle wrestling match. It occurs when one wrestler demonstrates a significantly higher level of skill and technique over their opponent, resulting in a lopsided score. When a wrestler achieves technical superiority, the match is immediately stopped, and the wrestler is declared the winner.
To achieve technical superiority, a wrestler must accumulate a certain number of points more than their opponent. The specific point difference required for technical superiority varies depending on the level of competition. For example, in international wrestling, a 10-point difference leads to technical superiority, while in some domestic competitions, a 15-point difference is required.
Scoring criteria for technical superiority
To understand how technical superiority is determined, it is essential to grasp the scoring criteria in freestyle wrestling. Wrestlers can score points through various maneuvers and actions during a match. These actions include takedowns, reversals, exposure of the opponent’s back to the mat, and successfully executing certain throws or holds.
Each maneuver has a predetermined point value assigned to it. For instance, a takedown may be worth two points, while exposing the opponent’s back to the mat could earn four points. The accumulation of points occurs throughout the duration of the match, and when a wrestler reaches the required point difference for technical superiority, the match is immediately concluded.
Understanding the intricacies of the pinning and technical superiority criteria in freestyle wrestling is essential for both wrestlers and spectators. These aspects not only determine the outcome of a match but also showcase the skill and expertise of the competitors. Whether through pinning techniques or the accumulation of points, freestyle wrestling offers an exhilarating display of athleticism and strategy.
Interpreting the Role of the Mat Chairman and Video Review
Responsibilities of the Mat Chairman
The mat chairman in freestyle wrestling plays a crucial role in ensuring fair and accurate scoring during matches. As the person in charge of overseeing the proceedings on the mat, they are responsible for several key tasks.
First and foremost, the mat chairman is responsible for ensuring that the match starts and progresses according to the rules and regulations of freestyle wrestling. They must make sure that both wrestlers are properly positioned on the mat, that the match begins on time, and that all actions and moves comply with the guidelines set by the governing body.
Additionally, the mat chairman is responsible for supervising the referees and scoring officials. They must ensure that the referees make accurate calls and that the scoring officials record the points correctly. The mat chairman also has the authority to correct any mistakes made by the referees or scoring officials if necessary.
Another important responsibility of the mat chairman is to settle any disputes or disagreements that may arise during a match. They have the final say in matters related to scoring, rule interpretation, and any other issues that may affect the outcome of the match. Their decision is based on their expertise and understanding of the freestyle wrestling scoring system.
Utilizing Video Review in Scoring Decisions
In recent years, video review has become an integral part of the freestyle wrestling scoring system. It allows for a more accurate assessment of actions and moves that may have been missed or incorrectly scored by the referees and scoring officials.
Video review is typically used in situations where there is a need to review a specific action or sequence that could potentially impact the outcome of the match. This can include reviewing takedowns, reversals, exposure, or any other scoring situation. The mat chairman, along with a team of video reviewers, carefully examines the footage to determine if the original call made by the referees was correct or if any adjustments need to be made.
The use of video review has greatly improved the accuracy and fairness of scoring decisions in freestyle wrestling. It provides an additional layer of scrutiny and ensures that wrestlers are awarded the points they rightfully deserve. It also helps to minimize human error and reduce controversies that may arise due to incorrect calls.
Challenges and Controversies
While video review has been a valuable addition to the freestyle wrestling scoring system, it is not without its challenges and controversies. One of the main challenges is the time it takes to review and analyze the footage. The process can sometimes be lengthy, leading to delays in the match and potential frustration for the wrestlers and spectators.
Controversies can also arise when there is disagreement between the referees and the video reviewers. Different interpretations of the rules and scoring criteria can lead to conflicting decisions, which may further complicate the scoring process and potentially impact the final outcome of the match.
Furthermore, there can be instances where the video footage is inconclusive or does not provide a clear view of the action in question. This can make it difficult for the mat chairman and the video reviewers to make a definitive ruling, leaving room for debate and dissatisfaction among the wrestlers and coaches.
Despite these challenges and controversies, the use of video review in freestyle wrestling has overall been a positive development. It has helped to improve the accuracy of scoring decisions and ensure a fair competition for all wrestlers involved. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that further refinements will be made to enhance the effectiveness of video review in the freestyle wrestling scoring system.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the freestyle wrestling scoring system is a complex yet integral part of the sport. By understanding the rules and regulations, both wrestlers and spectators can better appreciate the strategic elements and intensity of each match. From takedowns to exposure points, every move and action contributes to the final score. Whether you are a seasoned wrestler or simply a fan of the sport, having a clear understanding of the scoring system enhances the overall enjoyment and appreciation of freestyle wrestling. So, dive into the world of freestyle wrestling, explore its scoring system, and witness the athleticism and skill that makes this sport truly remarkable.

Mastering the Single Leg Takedown in Freestyle Wrestling
Are you looking to enhance your skills in freestyle wrestling and dominate your opponents with ease? Look no further! In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the art of mastering the single leg takedown. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your technique, this article will provide you with valuable insights, tips, and step-by-step instructions to help you excel in this essential move. Get ready to take your freestyle wrestling prowess to new heights and leave your competitors in awe.
The Basics of the Single Leg Takedown
The single leg takedown is a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling that can provide a significant advantage over your opponent. It involves taking control of one of your opponent’s legs and bringing them down to the ground while maintaining control. Mastering this technique requires a combination of proper footwork, positioning, gripping techniques, and a well-executed level change and penetration step.
Footwork and Positioning
Having correct footwork and positioning is crucial for a successful single leg takedown. To begin, establish a solid wrestling stance with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. This stance allows for better balance and agility, enabling you to react quickly to your opponent’s movements.
When going for a single leg takedown, step forward with your lead leg towards your opponent’s lead leg. Your lead leg should be outside of your opponent’s lead leg, creating an angle that provides a better opportunity to attack. Maintain a low center of gravity, keeping your head up and eyes focused on your opponent’s upper body.
Gripping Techniques
Proper gripping techniques are essential for gaining control of your opponent’s leg during a single leg takedown. There are various gripping options, but two common techniques are the high crotch grip and the ankle pick grip.
The high crotch grip involves reaching your same-side arm across your opponent’s body and securing a hold on their upper thigh, just below their hip. This grip allows for better control and leverage when executing the takedown.
The ankle pick grip, on the other hand, involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle with your same-side hand. This grip is effective when your opponent’s leg is extended or when they resist the high crotch grip.
Experiment with different gripping techniques and find the one that works best for you based on your opponent’s positioning and reactions.
Level Change and Penetration Step
Executing a proper level change and penetration step is the key to successfully completing a single leg takedown. A level change involves dropping your level by bending your knees and lowering your hips closer to the ground. This motion helps you avoid your opponent’s attacks and allows for a smoother transition into the takedown.
After the level change, perform a penetration step by driving your lead leg forward and shooting it towards your opponent’s leg. Simultaneously, reach for your desired grip on their leg, either high crotch or ankle pick. The penetration step should be explosive and quick, catching your opponent off guard and making it harder for them to defend.
Remember to maintain a strong grip, keep your head up, and drive through your opponent’s leg as you finish the takedown. Proper execution of the level change and penetration step, combined with precise footwork and effective gripping techniques, will greatly increase your chances of mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Common Variations of the Single Leg Takedown
High Crotch
The high crotch is a powerful and effective variation of the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg with your head positioned on the outside of their body. By grabbing their leg with both hands, you can drive forward and lift their leg off the ground, taking them down to the mat. The high crotch is known for its versatility, as it can be executed from various positions and angles. It requires good timing, speed, and technique to successfully execute the high crotch and secure the takedown.
Ankle Pick
Another common variation of the single leg takedown is the ankle pick. As the name suggests, this technique involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle and pulling it towards you, destabilizing their balance and setting up the takedown. The ankle pick is often executed when your opponent is in a defensive stance or when they are attempting to sprawl to defend against a regular single leg takedown. By quickly snatching their ankle and driving forward, you can bring them down to the mat and gain control.
Knee Tap
The knee tap is a variation of the single leg takedown that focuses on targeting your opponent’s knee for a swift takedown. This technique involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg, much like a regular single leg takedown, but instead of grabbing their leg, you aim to tap or push their knee with your hand. By applying pressure on their knee and redirecting their momentum, you can force them off balance and bring them down to the mat. The knee tap is particularly effective against opponents who have a strong base and are difficult to lift off the ground.
These variations of the single leg takedown provide wrestlers with a range of options to take down their opponents in freestyle wrestling. Each technique has its own advantages and requires practice to master. By incorporating these variations into your arsenal, you can become a more well-rounded wrestler with multiple takedown options at your disposal.
Defending Against the Single Leg Takedown
Sprawling
Sprawling is a crucial defensive technique when countering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves using your hips and legs to create distance and prevent your opponent from getting a hold of your leg. To perform a sprawl effectively, follow these steps:
Remember, practicing sprawls regularly is essential to develop the speed, timing, and technique required to defend against the single leg takedown effectively.
Whizzer and Overhook
Another effective method to defend against the single leg takedown is by utilizing the whizzer and overhook techniques. These techniques are especially useful when your opponent manages to secure a grip on your leg. Here’s how to execute the whizzer and overhook:
By mastering the whizzer and overhook techniques, you can effectively neutralize your opponent’s single leg takedown attempts and gain an advantage in the match.
Front Headlock
The front headlock is another valuable defensive technique that can be utilized to counter the single leg takedown. This technique involves controlling your opponent’s head and arm to prevent them from successfully executing the takedown. Here’s how to perform a front headlock:
Practicing the front headlock technique will not only enhance your defense against the single leg takedown but also open up various offensive possibilities.
Remember, mastering these defensive techniques takes time, practice, and repetition. By focusing on your sprawl, whizzer and overhook, and front headlock skills, you will significantly improve your ability to defend against the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Drills to Improve Single Leg Takedown
Shadow Drilling
Shadow drilling is a fundamental training technique that helps wrestlers perfect their single leg takedown. By visualizing an opponent and performing the movements without actual resistance, wrestlers can focus on their form and technique. Here are some key drills to incorporate into your shadow drilling routine:
Stance and Motion: Start by assuming the proper wrestling stance, with your lead leg forward and your weight distributed evenly. Practice moving in and out of your stance, circling, and level changing. This drill helps develop agility and quick footwork, which are crucial for executing a successful single leg takedown.
Penetration Step: The penetration step is the initial move in a single leg takedown. Practice driving off your back leg, stepping forward with your lead leg, and shooting your arm deep between your opponent’s legs. Focus on explosive power and maintaining a low center of gravity throughout the movement.
Finish Position: Once you have secured your opponent’s leg, it’s important to practice the proper finish position. Work on driving through your opponent, lifting their leg, and keeping your head up. Pay attention to your hand placement and grip, as they significantly impact your control over your opponent.
Partner Drills
Partner drills provide a dynamic training experience that simulates real-life wrestling scenarios. These drills help develop timing, coordination, and the ability to react to an opponent’s movements. Incorporate the following partner drills into your training regimen to enhance your single leg takedown skills:
Leg Defense Drill: Have your partner stand in a defensive position while you attempt single leg takedowns. Your partner’s goal is to sprawl and defend against your takedown attempts. Focus on properly executing your takedown technique while your partner tries to counter and defend. This drill improves your ability to read and react to your opponent’s movements.
Resistance Drill: Start in a neutral position with your partner. Initiate a single leg takedown while your partner provides resistance, forcing you to exert more effort to complete the takedown. This drill helps build strength and endurance while maintaining proper technique under pressure.
Counter Drill: In this drill, your partner attempts a single leg takedown while you work on countering their move. Practice sprawling, sprawling and turning, or executing a defensive technique like a whizzer. This drill improves your defensive skills and teaches you how to disrupt your opponent’s takedown attempts.
Live Situational Sparring
Live situational sparring involves engaging in controlled wrestling scenarios with a partner. It allows wrestlers to apply their single leg takedown skills in a realistic, dynamic setting. Here are some situational sparring scenarios to incorporate into your training:
Starting from Neutral: Begin the sparring session from a neutral position, with both you and your partner on your feet. Focus on initiating single leg takedown attempts while your partner defends and counters. This scenario simulates the unpredictability of a real wrestling match and helps sharpen your takedown skills under live conditions.
Starting from a Specific Position: Start the sparring session from various positions, such as starting with one wrestler already in on a single leg. This situation allows you to practice defending against an opponent in a dominant position and finding opportunities to counter and execute your own takedown.
Live Wrestling with Specific Objectives: Set specific objectives for the sparring session, such as scoring points with a single leg takedown or successfully defending against your partner’s takedown attempts. This type of situational sparring helps wrestlers focus on particular aspects of their single leg takedown game and improve their overall strategy.
By incorporating these drills and sparring scenarios into your training routine, you can enhance your single leg takedown skills and become a more formidable wrestler in freestyle wrestling. Practice diligently, stay focused, and never stop refining your technique.
In conclusion, mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling is a crucial skill that can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. By understanding the proper technique, positioning, and timing, wrestlers can effectively take down their opponents and gain an advantage in matches. The single leg takedown offers a versatile and reliable option for both offensive and defensive strategies, making it a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling. With consistent practice and dedication, wrestlers can develop their skills and become proficient in executing this technique. So, whether you are a beginner or an experienced wrestler, mastering the single leg takedown is an essential step towards achieving success in freestyle wrestling.

Activities",0.94712,8 Exercises For An Unstoppable Takedown - Fight Camp Conditioning,https://www.getphysical.com/blog/8-exercises-for-an-unstoppable-takedown,"To implement these exercises effectively, consider the following sample two-day training split: Day 1: Barbell Reverse Lunge with Clean Grip: 3 sets of 8 reps per leg. Contrast: Jumping Split Squat: 3 sets of 6 reps per leg. Sumo Deadlift: 3 sets of 6 reps. Contrast: Single Leg Lateral Hurdle Hop: 3 sets of 6 reps per leg.","8 Exercises For An Unstoppable Takedown
When it comes to incorporating strength training into the training regimen of wrestlers or martial artists, many coaches often make the mistake of using generalized exercises that may not have a direct carryover to their athletes' performance. However, to truly enhance skills in any sport, it is vital to break down the mechanics of the specific skill being performed. This holds true for complex techniques like leg attack takedowns, where exercises must focus on improving positioning and execution.
In this article, we will delve into four primary strength exercises that directly impact leg attack takedowns. These exercises target key areas of strength and athleticism, enabling wrestlers to optimize their performance on the mat. Additionally, we will explore explosive contrast movements that complement each exercise, further enhancing explosiveness and lateral drive. Get ready to transform your leg attack takedowns and dominate your opponents with these effective training techniques.
The barbell reverse lunge with a clean grip is a powerful exercise that improves the wrestler's stability when under the legs. By analyzing the positioning at the bottom of the lift, we can identify its direct correlation to a successful leg attack takedown. The stable ankle resembles the linear foot drive required after the initial penetration of a shot, while the knee and hip positions mimic those during a takedown. The loaded trunk, upright posture, and aligned thoracic spine simulate the resistance experienced during an opponent's defense.
Why choose the reverse lunge over the forward lunge? The reverse lunge involves driving the rear foot forward, replicating the movement required in a penetration shot. Conversely, a forward lunge would result in a backward drive, leading to an unfavorable position on the mat. To complement this exercise, incorporate the jumping split squat as a contrast movement. Focus on driving off the back toe with maximum force, propelling yourself off the ground for maximum speed.
The sumo deadlift is an ideal exercise for wrestlers due to its emphasis on lateral force. Unlike the conventional deadlift, the sumo deadlift requires generating significant lateral force into the ground. After securing your opponent's legs during an attack, the next step involves a lateral drive off the far foot. Linear drive during a takedown allows opponents to easily counter by retracting their hips and creating distance, jeopardizing your position. Enhancing lateral explosiveness is crucial for overpowering opponents and achieving successful takedowns.
As a contrast movement, incorporate the single-leg lateral hurdle hop. The emphasis here is on generating substantial lateral force, focusing on horizontal distance traveled rather than vertical height. Softly land on both feet on the other side, further developing the explosive lateral drive.
While horizontal pressing exercises are generally beneficial for pushing movements in matches or fights, a moderate-intensity close grip press for maximum speed from a standstill position can significantly enhance hand and striking speed. A slow reach during the penetration of a leg attack gives opponents more time to react and defend against your move. Observing the upper body during a leg attack, bent elbows and hands positioned a few inches from the chest are common. The arm reach is often performed without eccentric movement, resembling a dead pause.
The close grip floor catch press with a pause effectively targets the hand strike portion of a leg attack. The exercise emphasizes keeping the elbows at rest on the ground, maintaining the bar a few inches from the chest. The close grip also replicates the range of motion during elbow extension in contact sports, as most pushing movements occur within shoulder width. During the catch phase, release tension at the bottom and explosively drive the weight upward from a dead pause. Aim for a weight that doesn't require grinding. A training range of 75-85% of your 4-6 rep max is recommended.
For the contrast movement, try the kneeling medicine ball chest pass with a dead pause. Pause at the chest and explosively push the ball as fast as possible. Increase the distance or aim for specific targets or walls with each set to continually improve.
Isometric strength plays a significant role in mixed martial arts and wrestling, as athletes often need to hold positions against active resistance from opponents for extended periods. While horizontal and vertical pulling strength are commonly emphasized in wrestling programs, it is essential to recognize that pulling the legs toward oneself indicates poor penetration and improper knee/foot placement for executing an attack successfully.
A properly performed penetration shot positions the attacker's hips in front of the opponent's feet, with the arms wrapped around the legs. Overcoming the resistance of an opponent's defense requires exceptional horizontal isometric pulling strength. The inverted row is an excellent exercise for practicing horizontal isometric pulling strength, as it forces athletes to maintain a neutral spine. Opt for a neutral grip and squeeze the elbows in tightly at the top. Merely pulling to the chest is insufficient; focus on crunching the elbows in and activating the lat muscles, as if trying to hold an opponent's legs during resistance.
As a contrast movement, incorporate dynamic effort Pendlay rows. Use a resistance range of 60-70% of your one-rep max and perform sets of 2-3 reps. Focus on driving the elbows back as fast as possible, emphasizing speed rather than relying solely on arm strength. Squeeze the shoulder blades together at the top to maximize the benefits of the exercise.

Final Thoughts:
It is important to acknowledge that continuous practice of the skill itself is essential for improvement. However, incorporating specific strength exercises that target the mechanics and athleticism required in wrestling can significantly enhance performance. By carefully selecting exercises and understanding their direct relation to leg attack takedowns, wrestlers can make great strides in becoming unstoppable forces on the mat.

Bring your front leg back up and go back to your wrestling stance. Drill these movements repeatedly multiple times a week, and you'll be shooting like a high-level wrestler in no time. 2) The Single-Leg Takedown.","10 Wrestling Moves And Techniques You Should Master
Wrestling is one of the most popular martial arts worldwide, and it’s been around as far back as 3000 BC. It’s a grappling-based martial art that focuses on putting your opponent on the ground, controlling their body, and pinning them.
Wrestling is also an effective martial art for self-defense, and many view it as one of the best bases for mixed martial arts – the most permissive combat sport in the world that allows many of the techniques you might have to deal with in self-defense situations.
There are countless techniques used in wrestling, with some being more effective than others. This article will examine some of the most effective wrestling moves and techniques you should master. Many of these techniques carry over to other grappling-based martial arts like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and Judo.
Ten Wrestling Moves You Should Master
Ready to improve your wrestling skills? Let’s dive right into our list of techniques you should master:
1) The Penetration Step
The penetration step is the foundation for many takedowns used in wrestling like the single and double leg takedown. The technique is performed to put you in a position to grab onto your opponent and take them to the canvas.
Any competent wrestling school gets their students to drill this technique regularly unless the rules of the specific wrestling style forbid takedowns that target the leg, as is the case with Greco-Roman wrestling.
Practice the penetration step often until it becomes part of your muscle memory so you can execute the technique smoothly and quickly. The technique starts in your stance with your lead leg slightly in front of your rear foot and your torso a little bit bent at your hips.
Here’s how to perform the penetration step:
2) The Single-Leg Takedown
The single-leg takedown is one of the most commonly used techniques in wrestling, and that’s because it’s highly effective. There are several variations of the single-leg takedown, but they all involve targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and dragging them to the ground. There’s also the high crotch – commonly known as the hi-C single-leg technique that involves targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and using the hold to pick them off the ground and throw them to the floor.
The high single-leg takedown is the easiest type of single-leg attack to learn since you don’t need to perform a penetration step before shooting in on your opponent’s leg
Here’s how to perform a conventional high single-leg takedown:
Here’s how to complete a conventional single-leg takedown
Figure out which single-leg attacks work best for you and incorporate them into your wrestling game. These techniques are highly effective in wrestling settings and other grappling arts like BJJ.
3) Double-Leg Takedown
Double-leg takedowns are another popular technique used in wrestling. It’s a more interesting technique than the single leg, as it involves rapidly changing levels and exploding forward into your opponent. There are many ways to set up double-leg takedowns, like head snaps, hand ties, and misdirection.
These techniques are more effective when you catch your opponent with both legs close to each other, allowing you to wrap and lock your arms around them.
Shooting in is the building block for many wrestling takedowns, including double-leg techniques. Drill it frequently when you train to make your takedowns more effective. The faster and smoother your penetration step is, the more likely you’ll be able to complete takedowns when you shoot for them.
Here’s how to perform a double-leg takedown:
4) Sprawl
Sprawling is one of the fundamental defensive techniques used in wrestling, and it’s effective at all levels. Takedowns like the single leg and double leg involve wrapping your legs around your opponent’s legs to complete, but sprawling moves your legs out of your opponent’s legs and forces them to carry your weight. Your hand, head, and hips are your first line of defense against takedowns and holds, but you can always sprawl when all that fails.
Here’s how to perform a proper sprawl:
5) Snap-Down
The snap-down is a simple technique that puts you in the top turtle position. The best time to go for it is when your opponent is hunched over as they try to defend against incoming attacks. At that point, there’s nothing to stop their forward posture from crashing.
It’s a popular technique with freestyle wrestlers. Grapplers from other grappling styles, like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, are equally fond of it.
Here are the mechanics of the snap-down:
Besides being a simple way to end up in the top turtle position, snap-downs also open up your takedowns since both techniques require your opponent to do opposing things to defend against them. Your opponent needs to move their legs away from you to defend against takedowns which opens them up to the snap-down. Conversely, your opponent must pull their torso backward to defend against the snap down, leaving them vulnerable to takedown attempts.
6) Whizzer
The whizzer is another effective defensive move that all wrestlers should master. When you’re not in a position to sprawl out of a takedown attempt, the whizzer is your next line of defense. The technique involves securing a deep overhook on your opponent’s nearest hand as they try to complete a takedown.
Securing a whizzer puts lots of pressure on your opponent’s shoulder, and that’s often enough to discourage them from completing takedowns. You can also use the whizzer to drive your opponent to the ground in a half-nelson by wrapping your free hand around their neck, or you can execute a hip toss.
7) Switch
The switch is one of the fundamental techniques used to reverse disadvantageous positions in wrestling. A completed switch puts you in a dominant position or gets you back to your feet. Unlike escapes which only earn you a point in a wrestling match, reversals like the switch get you two points.
Here’s how to perform the technique:
8) Sit-Out
The sit-out is another fundamental defensive technique you can use to escape from bottom positions. At times, you can also use the technique to drag your opponent to the bottom.
Here’s what the mechanics look like:
9) Front-Quarter Nelson
The front-quarter nelson is a handy wrestling technique that carries over into other grappling arts. It’s an effective way to transition to a dominant position after stuffing an opponent’s takedown attempt with a sprawl.
To perform a front-quarter nelson:
10)  Chicken Wing (Armbar)
The chicken wing is one of the most uncomfortable things you can do to your opponent from top position. It’s also one of the most reliable holds for wearing down opponents and pinning them. Also known as the armbar in wrestling, the chicken wing gives your multiple options once you’ve secured the hold.
Here’s what the technique looks like:

Professional wrestling throws
Professional wrestling throws are the application of professional wrestling techniques that involve lifting the opponent up and throwing or slamming them down. They are sometimes also called ""power"" maneuvers, as they are meant to emphasize a wrestler's strength. Many of these moves are used as finishers by various wrestlers, who refer to them by several different names that reflect their gimmick. Moves are listed under general categories whenever possible.
Armbreaker[edit]
An armbreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams the opponent's arm against a part of the wrestler's body, usually a knee or shoulder.
Diving armbreaker[edit]
A wrestler dives from the ropes and lands on the opponent's arm.
Double knee armbreaker[edit]
The wrestler grabs one of the opponent's arms, jumps and connects both their knees against the opponent's stretched arm. As the wrestler falls onto their back, this forces the opponent's arm down into both knees, thus damaging it.
Arm drag[edit]
A move in which the wrestler uses their opponent's momentum to the opponent's disadvantage. The wrestler hooks the opponent's arm and flips them over on to the mat. The wrestler may roll on to their side to give the move extra momentum.
Japanese arm drag[edit]
This move is performed when an opponent runs towards the wrestler facing them. When the opponent is in range, the wrestler hooks the opponent's near arm with both hands and falls backwards, forcing the wrestler's own momentum to cause them to flip forwards over the head of the wrestler and on to their back. Despite its name, it actually originates from Mexican lucha libre, not Japanese puroresu.
Over-the-shoulder arm drag[edit]
The wrestler grabs their opponent's arm, then turns to face the other direction and pulls the opponent over their shoulder. It is essentially the same as the ippon seoi nage found in judo.
Tilt-a-whirl arm drag[edit]
An arm drag which sees the wrestler being spun in front of the opponent's body in a tilt-a-whirl, and then ending it with an arm drag.
Wheelbarrow arm drag[edit]
This arm drag sees the wrestler being held in a wheelbarrow hold by the opponent, and then going for an over the shoulder arm drag as they free their legs off of the opponent's waist. It was used by AJ Lee as a transition move.
Arm wringer[edit]
An arm wringer or spinning wristlock is a move in which the wrestler grabs the opponent's wrist with both hands and twists it over the wrestler's head to spin the arm around, either with enough force to flip the opponent to the mat or just to hyperrotate the joints while standing. When used as a hold, the wrestler often yanks the arm for added effect.
Atomic drop[edit]
A move in which the wrestler goes behind an opponent, then puts their head under the opponent's shoulder. They then lift their opponent up, and drops them tailbone-first on the wrestler's knee. Known in Mexico's lucha libre as silla eléctrica (Spanish for electric chair).
Inverted atomic drop[edit]
Also known as a ""Manhattan Drop"", this is a move in which the wrestler puts their head under the opponent's shoulder and lifts the opponent up and then drops their groin on the wrestler's knee.
Sitout full nelson atomic drop[edit]
Better known as a full nelson bomb, this move sees the wrestling apply a full nelson hold to the opponent from behind. The wrestler then lifts the opponent into the air and falls into a seated position, driving the opponent tailbone-first on to the mat. This move is used by Bubba Ray Dudley, who dubbed it the Bubba Bomb/Bully Bomb.
Backbreaker[edit]
A backbreaker refers to professional wrestling moves in which a wrestler drops an opponent so that the opponent's back impacts or is bent backwards against a part of the wrestler's body, usually the knee.[1]
Back body drop[edit]
A back body drop or backdrop (also sometimes called a shoulder back toss), is a move in which a wrestler bends forward or crouches in front of their opponent, grabs hold of the opponent, and stands up, lifting the opponent up and over and dropping them behind the back. It is applied frequently against a charging opponent. In Japan, a backdrop is the term for what is called a belly-to-back suplex in America, so in Japan, it is called shoulder throw.
Mountain bomb[edit]
Innovated by Hiroyoshi Tenzan. This move sees the opponent runs towards the wrestler. The wrestler ducks, hooks one of the opponent's legs with one of their arms, stands up and falls backwards, flipping the opponent and driving them back first down to the mat, with the wrestler landing on top of the opponent.
Biel throw[edit]
The wrestler stands slightly to the side of their opponent, grabs the opponent by the nape in a single or double collar tie, and throws them forward, causing the opponent to flip over onto their back. It is considered a very basic technique, so basic that a forward rolling fall is commonly called a biel bump and is mainly used by very large wrestlers to emphasize power and strength over finesse.
Brainbuster[edit]
A brainbuster is a move in which a wrestler puts their opponent in a front facelock, hooks their tights, and lifts them up as if they were performing a vertical suplex. The wrestler then either jumps up or quickly falls onto their back so that the opponent lands on their head while remaining vertical.
Bulldog[edit]
A bulldog, originally known as bulldogging or a bulldogging headlock or the headlock jawbreaker, is any move in which the wrestler grabs an opponent's head and jumps forward, so that the wrestler lands, often in a sitting position, and drives the opponent's face into the mat.[2] This move plus some other variations are sometimes referred to as facebusters.
Cobra Clutch bulldog[edit]
The wrestler applies a Cobra Clutch and then leaps forward, falling into a sitting position and driving the face of the opponent into the ground.
Diving bulldog[edit]
The wrestler jumps from the turnbuckle behind the opponent, then applies a headlock, driving the opponent's face into the mat. Popularized by Rick Steiner. It is also used by Trevor Murdoch as a finisher.
Also known as a Diving Famouser. The wrestler springboards off one of the ropes or jumps from the top turnbuckle, dropping a leg across the nape of a leaning forward opponent. This was popularized by both Billy Gunn and John Cena as one of their signature moves. Carmelo Hayes currently uses this move under the name Nothing But Net.
Fireman's carry bulldog[edit]
The attacking wrestler picks up the opponent in a fireman's carry. The wrestler then proceeds by holding their opponent's legs with one arm and applying a headlock with their other arm in a similar fashion to an Air Raid Crash. From here, the attacking wrestler twists the opposite way and quickly switches back, throwing the opponent's legs out backwards and drops down to the mat while holding the opponent's head, forcing them to fall face first into a bulldog position. This variation was used and popularized by TNA wrestler James Storm, who dubbed it the Eight Second Ride.
Full nelson bulldog[edit]
This variation begins with the wrestler holding the opponent in a full nelson. The wrestler then leaps forward into a sitting position, driving the opponent face-first. The move was popularized by Jillian Hall.
Half nelson bulldog[edit]
The wrestler hooks a half nelson hold on their opponent with one arm and their opponent's waist with the other, then leaps forward into a sitting position, driving the face of the opponent into the ground. This move is a signature of Edge , who calls it Winning Edge.
Inverted bulldog[edit]
The attacking wrestler stands side-to-side and slightly behind the opponent, facing in the opposite direction, then leaps in the air and drops to a seated position, driving the opponent neck- and back-first to the mat. In another variation, the attacker runs to the opponent and executes the move. This is usually referred to as a lariat takedown.
Knee drop bulldog[edit]
A version that involves the wrestler placing one knee against the base of a bent over opponent's neck, then dropping to force the opponent down to the mat, landing on the opponent's upper body. There is also a diving version.
Leg drop bulldog[edit]
The wrestler jumps in the air and uses one leg to push down on the head of an opponent who is leaning forward, which drives the opponent face-first into the mat. The move was innovated by Johnny Ace, calling it the Ace Crusher II, popularized by Billy Gunn, who called it the Famouser (or the fame-ass-er when he was wrestling as ‘Mr.Ass.) Nic Nemeth/Dolph Ziggler used the move as well. Marty Jannetty performed a version of the move where he applied a wristlock to the opponent first, which became known as the Rocker Dropper. Kelly Kelly later adopted the same variation as her finishing maneuver, calling it K2.
An inverted version of this sees the attacking wrestler drop the opponent on the back of their head, as done in a reverse bulldog. This can be achieved by first holding an opponent in an inverted facelock or by simply grabbing the opponent and forcibly leaning them back before lifting their far (or sometimes inside) leg, rotating so the leg is over the opponent's head, and dropping to a sitting position, kneeling, or a split-legged position and maintained into a pin. WWE wrestler Melina popularized this move.
One-handed bulldog[edit]
The one-handed bulldog is in fact more of a facebuster than an actual bulldog and generally sees a wrestler run up from behind their opponent, grab the opponent's head with one hand, and leap forward. Kenny Omega has used a variation, called the Kotaro Krusher, where he performed a jump from the canvas over the opponent, usually jumping upwards of 6 feet before hitting the bulldog.
Reverse bulldog[edit]
Standing next to or diagonally behind an opponent, the attacking wrestler leaps up, grabs the opponent's head and pulls backwards, resulting in both individuals landing supine. Current TNA wrestler Nic Nemeth uses and popularized this move, which he calls the Danger Zone. It was previously known as the Zig Zag during his tenure in WWE as Dolph Ziggler.
Slingshot bulldog[edit]
Similar to a hangman, where the wrestler catches the opponent in a side headlock, running towards any set of ropes. The wrestler then jumps over them and bulldogs the opponent, driving the chin/face of the opponent into the top rope. The wrestler would eventually either land standing or seated on the apron or the outside of the ring.
The same maneuver can be used on a cornered opponent (who is facing away from the ring) to drive their face into the top turnbuckle.
Spinning bulldog[edit]
The wrestler stands to the side of the opponent and applies a side headlock. The wrestler then spins around in a circle and drops into a seated position, driving the opponent face-first into the mat.
Springboard bulldog[edit]
The wrestler applies a headlock on the opponent, then runs towards the ropes and bounces off, driving the opponent face-first into mat as they land. WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus popularized this move and dubbed it the Stratusfaction and it was also used by Bo Dallas as the Bo-Dog.
Two-handed bulldog[edit]
The wrestler places both hands behind the opponent's head, then falls into a seated position, slamming the opponent's face into the canvas. Another variation sees the wrestler placing one hand behind the opponent's head and the other behind the back, then falling backwards into a bulldog. WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley used this move as one of his signature moves. The move was also used by Scotty 2 Hotty as a signature move.
Wheelbarrow bulldog[edit]
This bulldog sees the opponent clutching the wrestler in a wheelbarrow bodyscissors. The wrestler then falls downwards, while still scissoring their legs around the opponent's waist, and pushes against the canvas. As they rebound back to the opponent, the attacker releases their legs, quickly places their hand behind the opponent's head, and goes for a bulldog. The bulldog is usually one-handed rather than a headlock bulldog.
Catapult[edit]
A catapult or slingshot catapult is a throw that typically starts with the opponent on their back, and the wrestler standing and facing them. The wrestler hooks each of the opponent's legs in one of their arms, then falls backwards to slingshot the opponent into a turnbuckle, ladder, rope, mat, etc. This can also be held for a backbreaker.
Chokeslam[edit]
A chokeslam is any body slam in which the wrestler grasps their opponent's neck, lifts them up, and slams them to the mat, causing them to land on their back. The move is used by numerous wrestlers, often larger ones who portray ""monster"" characters.
Cobra Clutch slam[edit]
In this slam a wrestler places the opponent in a Cobra Clutch and then lifts the opponent into the air by his/her neck before jumping backwards to drive the opponent back-first down to the mat while remaining standing, falling forward, or dropping into a seated or kneeling position. The fall-forward version of the move were both used by Billy Gunn as the One & Only and later popularized by Ted DiBiase Jr., who used a modified version in which he dropped the opponent to one side, naming it the Dream Street. Jinder Mahal currently uses the kneeling side slam version of this move, calling it the Khallas.
DDT[edit]
The DDT is a move innovated by Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, performed by putting the opponent's head underneath the attacker's arm in a front facelock and then falling back, driving the opponent's head into the mat.
Driver[edit]
A driver is a move in which the wrestler clutches the opponent's body in some form before falling into a sitout position while dropping the opponent on their back, neck, and/or shoulders.
Black Fire driver[edit]
Used as a finisher by Rey Fenix, this move starts with the wrestler having their opponent up on their shoulders as if they are going to perform a muscle buster, but then spin their opponent around into a Michinoku driver II-B.
Cobra Clutch driver[edit]
The wrestler stands behind an opponent and applies a cobra clutch on their opponent, placing one of their hands against the opponent's neck after hooking the opponent's arm with it. They then scoop the opponent's near leg with their other arm and lift the opponent up, flip the opponent upside down, and then either kneel or sit down, driving the opponent down to the mat on their neck. Another variation has the attacking wrestler apply a pumphandle prior to executing this technique and is used by wrestlers like Jinder Mahal.
Electric chair driver[edit]
Also known as a Joker Driver. In this variation of a driver, the wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in an electric chair sitting position and then takes hold of the opponent and pulls them over their shoulder and down to the mat while falling to a sit out position so that the opponent lands on their upper back and neck between the legs of the wrestler, facing towards them, usually resulting in a pin. A one-handed variation is used by Kenny Omega, known as the One-Winged Angel and by Big Damo known as the Ulster Plantation. Chris Hero has also used this move as well, calling it the Rubik's Cube, as well as ""Speedball"" Mike Bailey, who uses a cross-legged version of the move called the Flamingo Driver.
Fisherman driver[edit]
This move was innovated by Shiro Koshinaka and it was called a Samurai Driver '94 as a finisher. The wrestler places the opponent in a front facelock and hooks one of the opponent's legs with their free arm. The wrestler then lifts the opponent upside down or on to their shoulders, and then sits down, driving the opponent between their legs, head and shoulder first. A wrist-clutch variation of this driver exists which sees the wrestler lift the opponent on to their shoulders, and while the opponent is on their shoulders, he/she uses the hand hooking the opponent's leg to reach upwards and clutch the wrist of the arm opposite the hooked leg. While maintaining the wrist-clutch, they then perform the driver. There is a further variation that does not include the shoulder lift that sees the wrestler hook the leg and wrist while the opponent is standing in front of him/her, lift the opponent upside down and then fall to the sitout position. This move was made popular by wrestler Low Ki who calls it the Ki Krusher. A cross legged version is used by CIMA, who calls it the Perfect Driver.
This variation involves grabbing and pulling by the opponent's wrist, then lifting them up into the air, before falling to their back, driving the opponent to the ground on the back of their head/neck. This was popularized by Shingo Takagi as The Last Falconry, now known as The Last of the Dragon.
Half nelson driver[edit]
This was invented by Kensuke Sasaki. The wrestler stands behind an opponent and applies a half nelson hold on their opponent, placing one of their hands against the opponent's neck after hooking the opponent's arm with it. They then scoop the opponent's near leg with their other arm and lift the opponent up, flip the opponent upside down, and then either kneel or sit down, driving the opponent down to the mat on their neck. Another variation has the attacking wrestler apply a pumphandle prior to executing this technique. This variation has been used by Jordynne Grace (Juggernaut Driver), Pénta El Zero M (Pénta Driver), Yoshi-Hashi (Karma), Shingo Takagi (Made in Japan) and several other wrestlers.
Michinoku Driver II[edit]
Innovated by Taka Michinoku, and technically known as a sitout scoop slam piledriver. Facing their opponent, the wrestler reaches between their opponent's legs with their right arm and reaches around the opponent's neck from the same side with their left arm. They then lift the opponent up and turn them around so that they are held upside down, as in a scoop slam, before dropping down into a sitout position, driving the opponent down to the mat neck and shoulder first. Many people call it the Michinoku Driver because it is used more often than the original Michinoku Driver. This variation of the move was also used by Vampiro under the name Nail in the Coffin.
A variation of the Michinoku Driver II in which the wrestler stands behind the opponent, applies an inverted facelock, lifts them upside down, and then drops down to a sitting position, driving the opponent down to the mat between the wrestler's legs upper back first.
Samoan driver[edit]
The attacking wrestler drapes an opponent over their shoulders in a fireman's carry position and then takes hold of the opponent and pulls them over their shoulder and down to the mat while falling to a sitting position so that the opponent lands on their upper back and neck between the legs of the wrestler, facing towards them. A cross-legged and wrist-clutch version of this move also exists. It is used as finishing moves by wrestlers such as TNA wrestlers Chris Sabin (Cradle Shock), Su Yung (Panic Switch), and Ash by Elegance (formerly known as Dana Brooke in WWE), and is also used by WWE superstars Santos Escobar (Phantom Driver) and Lyra Valkyria (Nightwish). Former WWE Diva Ivory uses this as a signature move. Shinsuke Nakamura formerly used the move as a finisher as Landslide, only to later change his primary finisher to the Bomaye/Kinshasa, although he stills occasionally uses the move as a signature.
Wheelbarrow driver[edit]
Similar to the wheelbarrow facebuster but instead of dropping their opponent face first, they drop their opponent so that the opponent lands on their upper back and neck between the legs of the wrestler, facing towards them, usually resulting in a pin. Swerve Strickland is well known for using this move as his finisher, using a half-nelson variation dubbed the JML Driver.
Electric chair drop[edit]
The wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in an electric chair sitting position and then falls backwards driving the opponent back-first into the mat. There is also a driver, a facebuster and a suplex variation of the move.
Facebreaker[edit]
A facebreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams their opponent's face against a part of the wrestler's body, usually the knee.
Double knee facebreaker[edit]
This facebreaker involves an attacking wrestler, who is standing face-to-face with an opponent, hooking both hands around the opponent's head and then leaping to bring both knees up to the face of the opponent. The wrestler then falls backwards to the mat, thus forcing the opponent to fall forwards and impact the exposed knees. The move was originated by Phillip Michael Grant, and later popularized by Chris Jericho, who named it the Codebreaker. It would also be used by Asuka, James Storm and Carmelo Hayes as signature moves, with Storm referring to the move as Bottoms Up! and Hayes referring to it as The First 48. Bushi uses a diving variation called MX where he dives from the top rope to hit the double knee facebreaker, as well as Tessa Blanchard, who calls the move Magnum, also as an hommage to her stepfather Magnum T.A.. Liv Morgan's 201/Jersey Codebreaker is a variation where she stands 90 degrees from the opponent, and delivers the double knees or shins while she is landing on her back.
Fireman's carry facebreaker[edit]
This move is performed in a manner similar to the TKO, but instead of dropping their opponent face first on the mat, they would be dropped face first on the knee of the wrestler performing the move. Austin Theory is currently using this move as a finisher initially dubbed as the Austin Theory Lift (ATL) during his time in NXT, but now has been dubbed the A-Town Down ever since moving up to the main roster.
Inverted stomp facebreaker[edit]
Also known as the Foot Stunner. The user applies a standing wrist lock on their opponent, then places their foot on the opponent's face and falls backwards, forcing the opponent's face into their foot. This move is used as a finishing move by Gail Kim (Eat Defeat), Chuck Taylor (Sole Food), Xavier Woods (Lost in the Woods), Enzo Amore (JawdonZo), Colt Cabana (Eat The Feet) and Mia Yim (Seoul Food [formerly known as Eat Defeat]).
Knee smash facebreaker[edit]
The move is a standard facebreaker which involves the wrestler facing an opponent and grabbing him or her by the head or hair and pulling the opponent's face down, dropping it on to the wrestler's knee. Often used by a wrestler to stun an opponent and set him or her up for another move. Many other facebreakers use the knee to inflict the damage; one variation sees the wrestler apply a standing side headlock, and simultaneously pull the opponent forward and smash the wrestler's knee to the opponent's head. Triple H popularized this move.
Shoulder facebreaker[edit]
Also described as a hangman's facebreaker or an over the shoulder facebreaker, this facebreaker is performed when an attacking wrestler, who is standing in a back to back position with an opponent, reaches back to pull the opponent's head over their shoulder before (while keeping a hold of the opponent's head) spinning round to twist the opponent's head over as they drop down to one knee forcing the opponent face-first into the wrestlers exposed knee in one quick fluid motion.
Single knee facebreaker[edit]
Similar to the double knee facebreaker, but with only one knee. Shawn Spears used this move during his second tenue in the WWE as ""Tye Dillinger"", calling it Perfect 10. Ricochet uses this move, calling it Recoil and Gregory Helms also uses it
Facebuster[edit]
A facebuster, also known as a faceplant, is any move in which the wrestler forces their opponent's face down to the mat which does not involve a headlock or facelock.
Fireman's carry throws[edit]
A fireman's carry involves the wrestler holding the opponent in place over both shoulders. From this position, various throws can be performed.
Airplane spin[edit]
A wrestler lifts the opponent on to their shoulders and spins around and around until they get dizzy and crash to the ground. This move has been made famous notably by WWE Hall of Famer Gorilla Monsoon and NXT's Tyler Bate. This move was the finisher of Mike Rotunda during his time in the WWF in the mid-80s.
Also known as the UFO (Unidentified Flying Opponent), this move is performed from an Argentine Backbreaker Rack Hold. Occasionally, the person doing the move can do it without their hands on their opponent, typically on the hips. Used by Claudio Castagnoli.
Death Valley driver[edit]
Also known as the Death Valley Bomb in Japan, this move is performed from a fireman's carry. The wrestler throws the opponent off their shoulders and falls in the direction that the opponent's head is facing, driving the opponent's head or back into the mat. Similar to the fireman's carry takeover, with more of an emphasis on targeting the neck. The Death Valley driver was innovated by Louie Spicolli (although he credits Etsuko Mita as the move's originator). Kazuchika Okada uses this move as Heavy Rain. Buddy Murphy uses a pumphandle lift version called Murphy's Law. Velveteen Dream uses a cartwheel version of the move itself called the Dream Valley Driver.
Also known as the Victoria Driver or Burning Hammer, this move is executed from an Argentine backbreaker rack position. The wrestler then falls sideways, driving the opponent's head to the mat. This is considered an extremely dangerous move, as the opponent's body cannot roll with the natural momentum of the move to absorb the impact. In a cut-throat variation of this driver, instead of holding the body of the opponent, a wrestler holds the far arm of the opponent across the opponent's own throat and maintains it by holding the opponent's wrist before performing the inverted Death Valley driver. The Inverted Death Valley Driver was innovated by Kotetsu Yamamoto in the 1970s but popularized by Kenta Kobashi as the Burning Hammer. Michael Elgin uses a sit-out variation of the Burning Hammer so as not to hurt the head or neck of his opponent allowing them to roll left or right, while Tyler Reks' Burning Hammer saw hers flip the opponent onto their stomach before impact (as in an inverted Fireman's Carry Takeover).
A variation between the regular Death Valley driver and the inverted one. The opponent lies on their side on the shoulders of the wrestler, facing either the opposite or the same direction as the wrestler, with the wrestler holding the opponent by the lower leg and either the head or lower arm. The wrestler then falls sideways, driving the opponent down to the mat shoulder and neck first. Cesaro used this move a few times and now uses it as his signature move, named the Swissblade.
Fireman's carry drop[edit]
The attacking wrestler first lifts their opponent over their shoulders in a fireman's carry position. The attacking wrestler then pushes the opponent forward and off their body, slamming the opponent face-down onto the mat. The wrestler may land in a kneeling or squatting position. This move was used by Mojo Rawley.
Fireman's carry headlock spinning elbow drop[edit]
The wrestler performs the fireman's carry from a standing position, then tosses the opponent off their shoulders and drops the opponent into a Headlock Elbow Drop. It is currently used by Hirooki Goto as the GTW.
Fireman's carry sitout side powerslam[edit]
The wrestler wrestler performs the fireman's carry from a standing position, then swings the opponent around and drops them Sitout side powerslam. The move is used by Hiromu Takahashi as the Dynamite Plunger and Jordan Devlin as the Ireland's Call.
Fireman's carry slam[edit]
The wrestler first drapes an opponent over their shoulders in a fireman's carry position. The wrestler then takes hold of the thigh and arm of the opponent, which are hung over the front side of the wrestler, and leans forward, pulling the opponent over their head and shoulders, slamming them down on their back in front of the wrestler. A rolling fireman's carry slam is a variation that sees the wrestler keep hold of the opponent and run forward before slamming the opponent to the ground, using the momentum to roll over the opponent and is referred to as a Steam Roller, Rolling Hills or Finlay Roll. A variation of this move from corner middle rope exist and has been used by Mr. Kennedy which he called the Green Bay Plunge. A swinging leghook fireman's carry slam is another variation that involves a wrestler holding the wrist of the opponent while putting their head under the opponent's chest. Then after grabbing the opponents nearest leg, the wrestler lifts the opponent's leg outward before swinging forward using the opponent's momentum and slamming them down back-first. A neckbreaker variation also exists where the wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in a fireman's carry, then lifts their opponent over and grabs the head before slamming them down in a neckbreaker slam. Bobby Roode used the neckbreaker version as a finisher, which he calls Roode Bomb. Keith Lee uses a powerslam or jackhammer version as a finisher that he calls the Big Bang Catastrophe.
Another version of this move sees the wrestler using which ever near hand on the opponent's chest to push and throw them upwards while maintaining the hold on the opponent's inside thigh to slam them over to one's side while remaining standing. Diamond Dallas Page used the standing version. Falling and kneeling variants were used by former NXT Rookie Lucky Cannon which he called ""Lucky Break"" and by the late former WCW and WWF star Sean O'Haire as the Widow Maker. This move has also been transitioned into a sidewalk slam, a fall forward side slam, and a chokeslam.
Fireman's carry takeover[edit]
There are two versions of the fireman's carry takeover used in professional wrestling. The first is borrowed from amateur wrestling and sees the wrestler kneel down on one knee and simultaneously grab hold of one of the opponent's thighs with one arm and one of the opponent's arms with their other arm. The wrestler then pulls the opponent onto their shoulders and rises up slightly, using the motion to push the opponent off their shoulders, flipping them to the mat onto their back. The other closely resembles a Death Valley driver. The wrestler performs the fireman's carry from a standing position, then tosses the opponent off their shoulders as they drop down to their knees, causing the opponent to land on their back. The standing variant is a higher impact version of the move because the wrestler falls from a greater height, and is a move closely associated with John Cena through his use of it as his finishing maneuver, which he calls the Attitude Adjustment (formerly the F.U.). Another variation sees the move done from the top or middle rope, used occasionally by Cena as the Super Attitude Adjustment.
The wrestler holds the opponent's wrist while putting their head underneath the opponent's chest, grabs the inside of one of the opponents legs, then lifts the opponent up onto their shoulders while falling backwards. This move was popularized by and named in reference to Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle, who also dubbed it the Angle Slam as an alternate name.[3]
The wrestler drapes an opponent over their shoulders in a fireman's carry position then falls backwards, driving the opponent down to the mat on their back. A one-handed, swinging leg hook, and a twisting version are also possible. This move is most often performed by wrestlers of Samoan heritage (typically from the Anoaʻi family, including The Rock, Rikishi and Roman Reigns (who uses the one-handed variant), as well as a pop-up version used by Umaga, Nia Jax, Jacob Fatu and The Usos. A top rope variant was also regularly performed by Scott Steiner, while Ronda Rousey uses the twisting version as a finisher, calling it Piper's Pit. This move was not only used just by wrestlers of Samoan heritage. Wrestlers such as Terry Gordy and Viscera have used this move as well. Mike Rotunda also used this move as a finisher during his run as VK Wallstreet and I.R.S., calling it the ""Stock Market Crash"". WWE Legend Tatanka also used this as a finisher, calling it the End of the Trail.
Flapjack[edit]
Also can be called a pancake slam, this maneuver involves the attacking wrestler lifting their opponent up in a quick motion while holding a single leg or both legs. Usually, the opponent's upper body and head is lifted above a shoulder of the attacker, while the legs have been caught. The attacker then falls on their back, bringing opponent's legs with them. The opponent lands face-first into the mat, with their upper body damaged. The Single-leg version is more commonly used. Former NXT Rookie Percy Watson used a variant in which he holds his opponent in a fireman's carry before transitioning into a flapjack, dubbing this move Percycution.
A hotshot is referred to when a flapjack is performed so that the opponent falls across the ring ropes. The fireman's carry flapjack sees the wrestler lift the opponent on to a fireman's carry, and then throw the upper body of the opponent away from the wrestler while the wrestler falls backwards, driving the opponent down to the mat chest first.
Also called a ""free-fall"" or ""push-up flapjack"". A pop-up is a flapjack where the attacker, upon facing an opponent rushing towards them, flings the opponent vertically up into the air without holding on to the opponent. The standing attacker or the airborne opponent is free to carry out an attack after the pop-up. Examples of attacks from the standing wrestler include performing a European uppercut to the falling opponent,[4] or catching the opponent and then performing a sitout powerbomb.[5] Examples of attacks from the airborne opponent include executing a dropkick on the standing opponent.[6] Tag teams may also utilize the pop-up by throwing an opponent to a teammate who would execute an attack.
Full nelson[edit]
Full nelson slam[edit]
In this move, the attacker places their opponent in a full nelson hold and uses it to lift them off the ground.
With the opponent in the air, the attacker removes one arm (so their opponent is now in a half nelson) and slams the opponent back-first into the mat. Another similar variation, known as a double chickenwing slam, sees the wrestler apply double chickenwing instead of a full nelson before slamming the opponent. Aron Stevens used the full nelson version.
Also known as the reverse full nelson slam, this variation sees the attacker tuck and slide their arms under the opponent's armpits and then clutch the opponent's lower jaw. Then, the attacker lifts the opponent before falling forward to slam the opponent back-first into the mat. This move is used as a finisher by Luke Gallows, dubbed the ""Gallows Pole""
Half nelson slam[edit]
The wrestler stands behind, slightly to one side of and facing the opponent. The wrestler reaches under one of the opponent's arms with their corresponding arm and places the palm of their hand on the back of the opponent's neck, thereby forcing the arm of the opponent up into the air to complete the half nelson. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up, turns, and falls forward, slamming the opponent back-first into the mat.
Giant swing[edit]
A giant swing starts with an opponent lying on the mat, face up, and the wrestler at the opponent's feet. The wrestler takes the opponent's legs up under their arms, similar to the setup for a catapult, but instead pivots, spinning around to lift the opponent off the mat. The attacker may release the opponent to send them flying, or simply slow until the back of the opponent returns to the ground. AEW's Claudio Castagnoli uses the giant swing as a signature move.
Guillotine drop[edit]
This move sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent in a standing guillotine choke and drop the opponent to the mat, lower spine first. This causes an effect to the whole spine and neck. A variation involving a standing double underhook rather than the guillotine choke also exists. It is used by Angel Garza as the Wing Clipper.
Gorilla press[edit]
Also known as a Military press, the attack sees the wrestler lift their opponent up above their head with an overhead press as used in weight lifting. The attacking wrestler may repeatedly press the opponent overhead to show their strength prior to dropping them.
Gorilla press drop[edit]
The wrestler lifts their opponent up over their head with arms fully extended, then drops the opponent down face-first in front or back. This was the finisher for wrestlers Chyna and the Ultimate Warrior. It is a popular technique for very large wrestlers because it emphasizes their height and power.
Gorilla press slam[edit]
This slam sees a wrestler first lift their opponent up over their head with arms fully extended, before lowering the arm under the head of the opponent so that the opponent falls to that side while flipping over and landing on their back. This move is also called the military press slam. Some wrestlers perform this maneuver by doing a lifting motion up and down or may hold the opponent in place before dropping them as a way to emphasize their raw strength. The British Bulldog used it regularly as signature move.
Another variation of this move that's done in one complete motion called a Deadly Driver sees the attacker performing this move to an opponent who is positioned on the top rope as a counter to an attempted diving attack. A double-team version of this move also exists.
Gutbuster[edit]
A gutbuster is any move in which the wrestler lifts their opponent up and jumps or drops him/her so that the opponent's stomach impacts against part of the wrestler's body, usually the knee. A basic gutbuster is often called a stomach breaker and is essentially the same as a backbreaker but with the opponent facing the opposite direction. This similarity with backbreakers is reflected in almost every gutbuster variation, which if inverted would become backbreakers and vice versa.
Elevated gutbuster[edit]
This variation of a gutbuster sees an opponent first elevated into a high lifting transition hold before being dropped down for a gutbuster. Taiji Ishimori uses a Single underhook version of the move as his finisher calling it the Bloody Cross while T. J. Perkins uses a double chickenwing version.
This is the most common version of the elevated gutbuster and sees the attacking wrestler first lift the opponent up across their shoulders; a position known as a fireman's carry, before then dropping down to one knee while simultaneously elevating the opponent over their head forcing them to drop down and impact their exposed knee. Wrestler Kaitlyn uses this as one of her signature move. A slight variation of this uses a modified double knee gutbuster and sees the attacking wrestler drop down to their back while bringing both knees up for the opponent to land on. Darren Young used the move as his finisher calling it Gut Check. The move was popularized by Roderick Strong, who calls it Death By Roderick.
An elevated gutbuster in which an attacking wrestler would lift an opponent up, stomach-first, across one of their shoulders before dropping down to their knees forcing the opponent's stomach to impact on the wrestler's shoulder.
Gorilla press gutbuster[edit]
A maneuver in which the user drops the opponent directly in front of them while putting their own knee out in front of them. The victim lands stomach or ribs first on the knee, made more impactful by the long drop. the double-knee variant was popularized by Xavier Woods.
Rib breaker[edit]
A rib breaker is a version of a gutbuster that involves the wrestler scooping the opponent up by reaching between the legs of the opponent with one arm and reaching around their back from the same side with their other arm. The wrestler then lifts their opponent up so they are horizontal across the wrestler's body. From here the wrestler drops down to one knee, forcing the opponent to drop stomach/rib-first against the wrestler's raised knee.
Headlock takedown[edit]
Also known as a spinning headlock takedown and side headlock takeover. This throw starts with the wrestler catching the opponent in a side headlock. The wrestler turns and twists their body so their back is horizontally against the opponent's torso. The wrestler turns to one side (depending on which hand is used to catch the opponent) while still catching the opponent with the headlock. Therefore, the opponent is slammed back-first into the mat after being almost ""forcibly flipped"" over the wrestler's back (as the wrestler turns to their sides).
Headlock driver[edit]
Similar to the snapmare driver, the wrestler applies a side headlock before dropping down on either their chest or their knees and driving the opponent's head down to the mat forehead first, with the side headlock. This was the original version of the finisher used by Jon Moxley (formerly as Dean Ambrose), known as Dirty Deeds before reusing as a regular move (paradigm shift) in 2019. Ethan Carter III (EC3) uses this as his finisher and he calls it the One Percenter. WWE superstar Bayley utilized this move during her indie days (then known as Davina Rose) dubbing it the Rose Plant. She started using a variant of this move where she hooks the opponents arm around the leg and planting the opponent in the canvas. She started using this move again in late 2019.L. A. Knight has also started using this move when he joined NXT, but it is preceded by a kick to the gut and is named Blunt Force Trauma (BFT)
Headscissors takedown[edit]
Known as tijeras (scissors) in Lucha Libre. This move is performed with the wrestler's legs scissored around the opponent's head, dragging the opponent into a forced forward somersault as the wrestler falls to the mat.[7] It is often erroneously called the Hurricanrana in American wrestling, but due to the lack of a double leg cradle pinning combination, it is a standard headscissors takedown.
Handstand headscissors takedown[edit]
This move is performed when the attacking wrestler, in a handstand position, scissors their legs around the opponent's head and follows with the headscissors takedown. There are multiple variations of the handstand headscissors takedown. For example, in one variation, the attacking wrestler rolls forward after scissoring their legs around their opponent's head; in another, the opponent rolls backwards into a handstand position to follow with a headscissors and the takedown.
It is commonly used by Kalisto and Cedric Alexander. This move was also popularized by Trish Stratus, who used it as a signature move, called the Stratusphere.
Tilt-a-whirl headscissors takedown[edit]
This move is actually a counter. Usually, the opponent grabs the attacking wrestler (as if he were performing a sidewalk slam), the attacking counters and swings their body upwards, then scissors their legs around the opponent's head, spins around the opponent's body, and swings their legs downwards, resulting in the headscissors takedown.
Hurricanrana[edit]
Though it is commonly referred to as a Hurricanrana, the original Spanish name for this maneuver is the Huracánrana. The name was taken from its innovator, Mexican luchador Huracán Ramírez. Sometimes referred to as a reverse victory roll, it is a headscissors takedown that ends in a double leg cradle pinning hold.[8][9] (A rana is any double-leg cradle.) A somersault version also exists, called the Dragonrana.
This move is derived from the original hurricanrana. It is described as a head scissors take down that is performed against a running opponent. The wrestler jumps on the shoulders of the charging opponent and performs a back flip. The move varies from the hurricanrana as when the opponent lands – he/she would land on their head as opposed to their back.[10]
It was named the ""Frankensteiner"" by Scott Steiner, who used it as a finishing move.[11] The move also has a variation where the opponent is sitting on the top rope, that variation is also referred to as frankensteiner.
Rey Mysterio uses a standing spinning version of this move which sees him, while standing behind the a standing opponent facing same direction, he jumps placing himself on both the opponents shoulders, spins around 180 degrees, and executes the backflip to land chest first to flip the opponent onto their back or to stay seated to reach back to hook the opponents legs to attempt to score a pinfall. This version is known as the Mysterio Rana. He was also known to transition into this move from a cartwheel to then jump onto the opponent's shoulders in his earlier career.
Another variation of the Frankensteiner sees a grounded wrestler first ""kip-up"" on to a standing opponent's shoulders, this is where a wrestler rolls on to the back of their shoulders bringing their legs up and kicking forward to build momentum to lift themselves off the floor and on to the standing opponent.
The wrestler performs a headscissors takedown to a seated or kneeling opponent, driving them head first into the mat. Ruby Soho and Kalisto use this move in some of their matches.[12][13][14][15]
Also known as an inverted frankensteiner or a poison rana, this move uses a standard Frankensteiner, but instead of performing the move facing the opponent's face, it is done facing the back of the opponent.
This maneuver is also known as swinging hurricanrana. The attacking wrestler, beginning on the corner, uses the top ropes for leverage to scissor their legs around the opponent (usually an oncoming opponent) and swings to perform the hurricanrana. This hurricanrana variation was popularized by Mickie James, as she named the move herself Mick-a-rana.
Hip toss[edit]
The wrestler stands next to the opponent with both facing the same direction, and the wrestler hooks their closest arm underneath and behind the opponent's closest armpit. The wrestler then quickly lifts the opponent up with that arm and throws them forward, which would lead the wrestler to flip the opponent on to their back to end the move. There is also a sitout variation, in which the wrestler performs a normal hip toss and then lands in a seated position.
Iconoclasm[edit]
This top rope flipping slam sees a wrestler stand under an opponent, who is situated on the top turnbuckle, turn their back to this opponent while taking hold of the opponent's arms from below, often holding underneath the opponent's arm pits. The wrestler would then throw the opponent forward while falling to a seated position, flipping the opponent over in midair, and slamming them down to the mat back first. CIMA uses both this move as well as a straight jacket version called the Goriconoslasm.[16][17] The wrestler may fall forward, kneel down, or remain standing while executing this move also.
Lance Archer, while using the original move as well, also uses a variation of this move referring to both called the Blackout. From a standing position, he reaches between an opponent's legs with his stronger arm and reaches around their back from the same side with their weaker arm before then lifting the opponent up over his shoulder. He then lifts the opponent holding underneath their armpits to execute a kneeling version of the slam.
Irish whip[edit]
Also called a hammer throw. A move in which the wrestler grabs one of their opponent's arms and spins, swinging the opponent into an obstacle such as the ring ropes, a turnbuckle, or the stairs leading into the ring. An Irish whip into the ring ropes is usually used to set the opponent up for another technique as he/she bounces off. An Irish whip into the turnbuckles usually sees the opponent remain in the corner, allowing a follow-up attack from the wrestler; the opponent may remain standing or slump to the ground, usually in a seated position, which will vary the attack. One occasional use of the Irish whip is to try to ""hit for the cycle"" by whipping one's opponent into each corner in turn. Some professional wrestlers can use this move as an advantage by running up the turnbuckle and using a high flying move.
The move acquired its name due to its association with Irish wrestler Danno O'Mahony.
Jawbreaker[edit]
A jawbreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams their opponent's jaw against a part of the wrestler's body, usually their knee, head or shoulder.
Shoulder jawbreaker[edit]
Also known as an inverted stunner, the wrestler stands facing the opponent, places their shoulder under the jaw of the opponent and holds the opponent in place before falling into a sitting or kneeling position, driving the jaw of the opponent into their shoulder.
Sitout jawbreaker[edit]
A standard jawbreaker is seen when a wrestler (either stands facing or not facing opponent) places their head under the jaw of the opponent and holds the opponent in place before falling into a sitting or kneeling position, driving the jaw of the opponent into the top of their head. Sometimes it is also used to counter a headlock by the opponent.
Stunner[edit]
A stunner is a three-quarter facelock jawbreaker. It involves an attacking wrestler applying a three-quarter facelock (reaching behind the head of an opponent, thus pulling the opponent's jaw above the wrestler's shoulder) before falling to a seated position and forcing the defender's jaw to drop down on the shoulder of the attacking wrestler. This move was innovated by Mikey Whipwreck and popularized by Stone Cold Steve Austin.
Mat slam[edit]
A mat slam is any move in which the wrestler forces the back of the opponent's head into the mat which does not involve a headlock or facelock. If these are used then the move is considered a type of DDT (if the wrestler falls backwards) or bulldog. Some neckbreakers also slam the back of the opponent's head into the mat, but the attacker is back-to-back with the attack's receiver. A standard mat slam involves the wrestler grabbing hold of the opponent by their head or hair and pulling back, forcing the back of the opponent's head into the mat.
Belly-to-back inverted mat slam[edit]
From a position in which the opponent is bent forward against the wrestler's midsection, the wrestler grabs around his or her opponent's midsection and lifts so that the opponent is held upside down, facing in the same direction as the wrestler. The wrestler then hooks both arms of the opponent using his or her legs, and then falls forward planting the opponent's body into the mat face-first. The move often sees the wrestler keep their legs hooked under the arms of the opponent after hitting the move, using the underhooking technique to turn the opponent on to their back into a Rana style pinning position. This move was innovated by Col. DeBeers and was made famous by A.J. Styles, who refers to the move as the Styles Clash. Styles performs the maneuver with a variation, as seen in the photos to the right: he does not hook the opponent's arms before performing the slam, but takes two steps and moves his legs in front of the opponent's arms enabling him to use his legs to cover the shoulders for a pin. This variant is later utilized by former WWE Diva Michelle McCool, who referred to the move as the Faith Breaker. Cesaro uses a variation called the Neutralizer where he grapevines the opponents leg with his arm similar to a cradle piledriver. El Phantasmo uses a cross-arm Variation called CRII, where he lifts his opponent up and he lets him fall face first into the mat.
Double underhook mat slam[edit]
The wrestler faces an opponent, overhooks both arms, and then pivots 180° so that the opponent is facing upwards with his or her head pressed against the upper back or under an arm of the wrestler. The wrestler then drops down to their back, driving the back of the opponent's head and neck into the mat.
Rear mat slam[edit]
As well known as a falling rear mat slam. This move starts with the wrestler standing behind the opponent, and then takes hold of the front of the neck or head, and then falls onto his stomach, driving the opponent's back of the head into the mat first. Another variation of this move sees the wrestler performing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, and as he floats over the opponent, he quickly grabs the opponent's head or neck with both hands and falls on his stomach to complete the rear mat slam.
The wrestler takes hold of their opponent from behind, holding them by either their hair or head. The wrestler then jumps backwards and falls to a sitting position, driving the back of the opponent's head into the ground between their legs. This was a signature move for Edge, which he called Edge-O-Matic. A variation sees the wrestler run up the corner turnbuckles, perform a backflip over a chasing opponent, and at the same time grab hold of the opponents head and perform the slam. Dustin Rhodes during his time in the WWF/WWE as Goldust used this move dubbing it ""Oscar"".
Sleeper slam[edit]
This slamming version of a headlock takedown sees a wrestler apply a sleeper hold to the opponent, then falls face first to the ground, pulling the opponent down with them and driving the back and head of the opponent into the ground. Heath uses a jumping variation of the move. A lifting version also exists, where a wrestler applies a sleeper hold to the opponent, lifts the opponent up and slams the opponent into the ground.
Slingblade[edit]
A spinning sit-out variation of a sleeper slam that makes use of the wrestler's own momentum. The attacking wrestler starts by running and extending his arm like a lariat takedown but instead performs a revolution around the opponent's shoulders. This causes the wrestler to switch to his opposite arm before taking his opponent down to the mat while simultaneously landing in a seated position. Another variation involves the wrestler leaping off the ropes before performing the movement. The move is used by Hiroshi Tanahashi, with some commentators even calling the move a 'Tanahashi' when anybody performs it due to how associated it is with him. Other users include Pentagon Jr., JTG, Seth Rollins, Masato Yoshino and Finn Bálor, with JTG calling it Da Shout Out. Richie Steamboat even used this as a finisher move during his time in FCW and NXT.
Tilt-a-whirl mat slam[edit]
As the name suggests the wrestler would first use a tilt-a-whirl to raise the opponent into a belly-to-belly (piledriver) position, from here the wrestler would fall forward planting the opponent into the mat back-first. Matt Riddle uses a cradle variant dubbed the Bro-Derek.
Monkey flip[edit]
This move, often referred to as a monkey climb in British wrestling, involves an attacking wrestler, who is standing face-to-face with an opponent, hooking both hands around the opponent's head before then bringing up both legs so that they place their feet on the hips/waist of the opponent, making the head hold and the wrestlers' sense of balance the only things allowing both wrestlers to be in an upright position. At this point, the attacking wrestler shifts their weight so that they fall backwards to the mat while forcing the opponent to fall forwards with them, only to have the attacking wrestler push up with their legs, forcing the opponent to flip forward, over the wrestler's head and onto their back. This move is most commonly performed out of a ring corner. This is due to it being easier to climb on an opponent while in the corner as balance is easily retained, and it allows the maximum length of ring to propel the opponent across.
Muscle buster[edit]
Invented by Kodo Fuyuki and inspired by Chamaco Valaguez's La Valagueza submission maneuver,[18] this move is performed when an attacking wrestler hooks both an opponent's legs with their arms and tucks their head in next to the opponent's before standing and lifting the opponent up, so that they are upside down with their head resting on the attacking wrestler's shoulder. From this position, the attacking wrestler jumps up and drops down to the mat, driving the opponent shoulder first down to the mat with the opponent's neck impacting both the wrestler's shoulder and the mat. This can see the wrestler pick up an opponent who is standing but bent forward, but it often begins with an opponent who is sitting on an elevated position, usually on a top turnbuckle, because it is easier to hook and lift an opponent when they are positioned higher than the wrestler. The move also has a neckbreaker variation, which focuses more of the attack on the opponent's neck. This move originated from the Kinnikuman manga, originally known as the Kinniku Buster (kinniku being Japanese for ""muscle""), with the move ending with the opponent crashing down on their neck against the attacking wrestler's shoulder. This variation is currently used by Jungle Kyona as the “Jungle Buster”.
Popularized by Samoa Joe as one of his finishers (he uses an electric chair version falling backwards, sparing the opponent's neck) until 2015 when he accidentally injured Tyson Kidd, which ended his wrestling career and almost paralyzed him. He would re-use the move in 2022 at AEW. Ryback uses a different variation as his finisher, called Shell Shocked, where he lifts the opponent into position with a fisherman's suplex and only hooks one of the opponent's legs before running forward and dropping them off his shoulders, in a Samoan drop-esque motion.
Neckbreaker[edit]
There are two general categories of neckbreaker, which are related only in that they attack the opponent's neck. One category of neckbreaker is the type of move in which the wrestler slams their opponent's neck against a part of the wrestler's body, usually their knee, head or shoulder. A neckbreaker slam is another technique in which the wrestler throws their opponent to the ground by twisting the opponent's neck.
Cutter[edit]
A cutter is a three-quarter facelock neckbreaker. This move sees an attacking wrestler, while facing away from the opponent, apply a three-quarter facelock (reaching back and grabbing the head of the opponent, thus pulling the opponent's jaw above the wrestler's shoulder) before falling backwards (sometimes after running forwards first) to force the opponent face-first to the mat below.
Piledriver[edit]
Whilst giving the illusions of slamming the opponent's head into the ground, a properly executed standard piledriver has the opponent's head barely touching the ground, if at all. The technique is said to have been innovated by Wild Bill Longson.
Powerbomb[edit]
A powerbomb is a move in which an opponent is lifted into the air and then slammed down back-first to the mat.[19] The standard powerbomb sees the opponent placed in a standing headscissors position (bent forward with their head placed between the wrestler's thighs), lifted on the wrestler's shoulders, and slammed back-first down to the mat. The move was innovated by Lou Thesz. This move was used as a finisher for wrestlers such as Batista, The Undertaker, Kevin Nash, Chyna, JBL, among others.
Powerslam[edit]
A powerslam is any slam in which the wrestler performing the technique falls face-down on top of their opponent. The use of the term ""powerslam"" usually refers to the front powerslam and the scoop powerslam.
Pumphandle[edit]
Pumphandle drop[edit]
Also known as a tilt slam or a pumphandle falling powerslam, the wrestler stands behind their opponent and bends them forward. One of the opponent's arms is pulled back between their legs and held, while the other arm is hooked. The wrestler then lifts their opponent up until they are parallel with the wrestler's chest, then throws themselves forward, driving the back of the opponent into the ground with the weight of the wrestler atop them.
Pumphandle fallaway slam[edit]
The wrestler hooks up the opponent as a pumphandle slam, then the wrestler goes through the body movements for the fallaway slam, executing the release of the opponent as they enter the apex of the throw, instead of at or just past the apex of the throw like when one executes the fallaway slam. Usually the opponent then adds effort to gain extra rotations in the air for effect or to ensure that they do not take the bump on their side.
Pumphandle slam[edit]
The wrestler stands behind their opponent and bends them forward. One of the opponent's arms is pulled back between their legs and held, while the other arm is hooked (pumphandle). The attacking wrestler uses the hold to lift the opponent up over their shoulder, while over the shoulder the attacking wrestler would fall forward to slam the opponent against the mat back-first, normally the type of powerslam delivered is a front powerslam. The move can also see other variations of a powerslam used, particularly into a sidewalk slam position. Ben Davis and Titus Carell use the pumphandle slam as finishers, Davis uses an implant slam calling it the Plantation Punk Slam while Carell uses a spinning slam calling it the Spinerella Slam. Rhea Ripley uses the move itself or a powerbomb version called Riptide.
The wrestler lifts the opponent as with a pumphandle slam, but falls to a sitting position and drops the opponent between their legs as with a michinoku driver II. Kenta Kobashi also used this move as a finisher as well, but his looked more like a sitout Powerbomb but with a pumphandle, he called this move the Kentucky Bomb.
Scoop[edit]
Body slam[edit]
A body slam is any move in which a wrestler picks up and throws an opponent down to the ground limp back-first. When used by itself, this term generally refers to a very basic variant for a scoop slam.
Scoop slam[edit]
Facing their opponent, the wrestler reaches between their opponent's legs with their stronger arm and reaches around their back from the same side with their weaker arm. The wrestler lifts their opponent up and turns them upside down so that they are held up by the wrestler's arm cradling their back. The wrestler then throws the opponent to the ground so that they land on their back. The opponent will often assist the slammer by placing their arm on the slammer's thigh.
Shin breaker[edit]
The wrestler faces the opponent from the side, slightly behind, then tucks their head under the opponent's near armpit and grabs hold of the opponent's near leg, bending it fully. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up and slams them downwards, driving one of the wrestler's knees into the opponent's bent leg. This move is used to weaken the leg for a submission manoeuvre.[citation needed]
Shoulderbreaker[edit]
A shoulderbreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams their opponent's shoulder against any part of the wrestler's body, usually the shin or knee. This move is normally used to weaken the arm for a submission maneuver or to make it more difficult for the opponent to kick out of a possible pinfall attempt. The most common version sees the wrestler turn the opponent upside-down and drop the opponent shoulder-first on the wrestler's knee. Usually the opponent is held over the wrestler's shoulder in either a powerslam position, or less commonly an inverted powerslam position for what is sometimes called the inverted shoulderbreaker.
Snake eyes[edit]
This move sees the standing wrestler place the opponent stomach down on their shoulder so that they both are facing the same direction. The attacking wrestler then drops the opponent face-first into the turnbuckle or ropes. This move is most commonly used by The Undertaker. Johnny Gargano uses a variation called Lawn Dart, where he throws the opponent face first onto the second turnbuckle.
Snapmare[edit]
With the wrestler's back to the opponent, he/she applies a three-quarter facelock (also known as a cravate) and, either kneeling down or bending over, pulls the opponent forward, flipping them over their shoulder down to the mat, back first. Another variation, sometimes called a ""flying mare"", sees the wrestler pull the opponent by the hair over their shoulder before slamming them to the mat.[7]
Rolling snapmare[edit]
This variation of the snapmare sees the application of the facelock with the takeover to the opponent, but rather than the wrestler remaining stationary, he rolls with the opponent's momentum.
Snapmare driver[edit]
A high impact variation of the snapmare where instead of flipping the opponent over, the wrestler drops down either on their chest or down on their knees and drives the opponent's head down to the mat forehead first, with the three-quarter facelock much like a cutter. An inverted variation of this move also exists. However, the wrestler holds their opponent's head in a back to back position, before performing the move. Adam Rose used this as the Party Foul. Melina used this move after her return in 2010, most notably to win her second Diva's championship at SummerSlam 2010. . Madcap Moss uses a reverse neckbreaker like variation of this move, calling it the Punchline.
Snapmare neckbreaker[edit]
A high impact combination of the snapmare and the falling neckbreaker. With the wrestler's back to the opponent, he/she applies a three-quarter facelock and then pulls the opponent forward, flipping them over their shoulder, before turning to land in a neckbreaker. Tyson Kidd briefly used this as his finisher in 2009.
Spinebuster[edit]
A spinebuster is a move in which the wrestler starts by facing his opponent and then grabs him around his waist, lifts him up, and then either slams the opponent down while landing on top of them, or tosses them forward on to their back. It was used as a signature and a finisher by wrestlers such as The Rock, Batista, Ron Simmons, Arn Anderson among others.
Spinning crucifix toss[edit]
The attacker lifts the opponent above his back with the opponent's arm spread out in a crucifix hold, spins around multiple times in place, pushes the opponent up, and moves out of the way, dropping the opponent down to the mat. Kevin Nash used this move as a finisher during his time as his character Oz and called it the Oz Twister. James Storm currently uses this move calling it the Eye Of The Storm.
Suplex[edit]
A suplex is the same as the amateur suplex, a throw which involves arching/bridging either overhead or twisting to the side, so the opponent is slammed to the mat back-first. Though there are many variations, the term suplex (without qualifiers) can also refer specifically to the vertical suplex, Made famous by Terence Travis from Mossley Hill.
Trips and sweeps[edit]
Armbar legsweep[edit]
The wrestler stands beside their opponent to either side, crosses their arm against the opponent's opposite hand in front of it (as the wrestler stands beside the opponent, and uses for example their right arm, they would cross it against the opponent's left arm, and vice versa). From this point, the wrestler places their leg in front of the opponent's opposite leg, and falls backwards, causing the opponent's arm to be slammed into the mat.
Double leg takedown[edit]
A tackle where the intention is to force the opponent down on their back by tackling them at their waist or upper thighs. This usually involves grabbing the opponent with both arms around the opponent's legs while keeping the chest close to the opponent, and using this position to force the opponent to the floor .
Dragon screw legwhip[edit]
Dragon screw legwhip (or simply Dragon screw) is a legwhip where a wrestler grabs an opponent's leg and holds it parallel to the mat while they are facing each other. The attacking wrestler then spins the leg inwards causing the opponent to fall off balance and twist in the air bringing them to the ground in a turning motion. It is used by the ""Ace of the Universe"" Hiroshi Tanahashi
Drop toe-hold[edit]
The wrestler falls to the ground, placing one foot at the front of the opponent's ankle and the other in the back of the calf. This causes the opponent to fall face first into the ground. It is sometimes used illegally to force an opponent into a chair or other elevated weapon; it is also used occasionally to force an opponent face-first into the turnbuckles, stunning them momentarily. This move can also be used by an already grounded wrestler as a counter to a standing or charging opponent.
Half nelson legsweep[edit]
The wrestler stands behind, slightly to one side of and facing the opponent. The wrestler reaches under one of the opponent's arms with their corresponding arm and places the palm of their hand on the neck of the opponent, thereby forcing the arm of the opponent up into the air (the half nelson). The wrestler then uses their other arm to pull the opponent's other arm behind the opponent's head, so both opponent's arms are pinned. The wrestler then hooks the opponent's near leg and throws themselves backwards, driving the opponent back-first to the ground. This was the finisher of Byron Saxton, dubbed ""Saxonation"".
Russian legsweep[edit]
Also known as a side Russian legsweep and called a neckbreaker by Gorilla Monsoon. This is a move in which a wrestler stands side-to-side and slightly behind with the opponent, facing in the same direction, and reaches behind the opponent's back to hook the opponent's head with the other hand extending the opponent's nearest arm, then while hooking the opponent's leg the wrestler falls backward, pulling the opponent to the mat back-first. There is also a jumping variation of the Russian legsweep, which is similar in execution to that of the leaping flatliner and different modified versions of the move.
Also called a Cobra clutch buster, the wrestler places their opponent in a cobra clutch, then stands to one side of the opponent, hooks their nearest foot behind their opponent's nearest leg and throws themselves backwards, forcing their opponent backwards to the ground. Ted DiBiase and his son Ted DiBiase Jr have used this move as a finisher.
The wrestler grabs the opponent by the arm and goes behind him while holding the arm and hooking the opponent's leg. The wrestler then bends the opponent's back and slams their face to the mat. The forward Russian legsweep was popularized by Jeff Jarrett, who began using the maneuver as a finisher in the late 1990s and calls it The Stroke.
A slight variation of the forward Russian legsweep, the wrestler approaches the opponent from behind and places them in a full nelson before hooking their leg. The wrestler then falls forward in an almost identical way, slamming the opponent face-first into the mat. The most notable practitioner of this variant is The Miz, who calls the move the Skull Crushing Finale and has used it as a finisher since August 2009.
The wrestler stands in front of, facing away from and slightly to one side of the opponent. The wrestler then reaches behind themselves and applies a three-quarter facelock to the opponent.
The wrestler then hooks the opponent's near leg with their own near leg and sweeps the leg away, simultaneously throwing themselves backwards, thus driving the opponent to the ground (with the weight of the wrestler on top of them) and wrenching the opponent's neck. Former WCW wrestler Lash Leroux is best known for using this move as a finisher which he calls the Whiplash '00.
Schoolboy sweep[edit]
This technique gives its name to the schoolboy bump and is performed when the wrestler gets behind their opponent, drops down to their knees, puts their hand through the opponent's legs, hooking the opponent's hips, and pulls backwards. This pulls the opponent backwards, with straightened and trapped legs, forcing the opponent to fall backwards, over the wrestler, flat on the floor.
STO[edit]
The STO (Space Tornado Ogawa) is a sweep in which a wrestler wraps one arm across the chest of their opponent and sweeps the opponent's leg with their own leg to slam the other wrestler back-first. This can also be a lariat-legsweep combination to slam down the opponent. This is also a move used often in Judo and in other grappling martial arts. This maneuver can be used running and standing. Innovated by Black Gordman during the 70s and 80s before utilized by Japanese silver medalist judoka Naoya Ogawa. Evil currently used this as Evil. Shad Gaspard used a high impact variant of this move called Thugnificent. Johnny Gargano uses a Full Nelson and reverse variant of this move called Hurts Donut (formerly referred to as Uniquely You).
The wrestler faces the opponent, ducks under the opponent's arm closest to them, wraps their closest arm around the waist of the opponent and then quickly performs a forward flip whilst sweeping the opponent's leg, thereby dropping the opponent on their back, ending up in a cradle pin.[20][21][22] This move was innovated by Madoka as Ranhei. It was also made popular by Kofi Kingston, who calls it the S.O.S.
This move is an STO where the wrestler would first apply a chokehold with one hand before sweeping their opponent's leg. Alexa Bliss uses this as a signature move, normally followed by her rope-assisted repeated stomps.
This variation of the STO sees the attacker apply a front facelock on his opponent and sweeping the opponent's leg and falling forward, with the opponent landing on his neck and shoulders. A pinning variation also exists where the attacker keeps the front facelock applied as he covers the opponent slightly.
Flatliner[edit]
Well known as the complete shot or reverse STO, this is a move in which a wrestler stands side-to-side and slightly behind with the opponent, facing in the opposite direction, and reaches around the opponent's torso with one arm across the opponent's chest with their hand holding on to their other hand which is behind the opponent's head. The wrestler then falls backward, driving the opponent into the mat face-first. The wrestler can also cross their leg between the opponent's leg before hitting the reverse STO, with this slight variation being known as a leg hook reverse STO.It was innovated by Gedo.
This move sees the wrestler stand side to side with the opponent, tucking his arm behind the opponent's head at a 90° angle and putting his near leg in front of the opponent's closest leg. The wrestler then pushes the opponent forward and quickly pulls them backward, with the attacker landing on their back whilst the opponent falls face first.
In this variation the wrestler first locks the opponent in a standard flatliner lock, then sees the opponent and put his ankles on some elevated surface (usually top rope, or turnbuckle, or barricade outside of the ring), the wrestler then falls backward, driving the opponent face-first into the mat. Another variation of this move including the opponent standing on the apron outside of the ring, and attacking wrestler first grabs opponent and pulls him over the top rope until opponent's ankles match the ropes, the attacking wrestler then falls backward, driving the opponent face-first into the mat. Tommaso Ciampa used this move at NXT TakeOver: Toronto in a match against Scott Dawson.
The wrestler locks a back-to-back backbreaker submission in (better known as the Gory Special) and then drops the opponent into a Swinging flatliner. Popularized by Brian Cage as Weapon X.
A variation of the flatliner, this move see the wrestler jumping up towards the side of an opponent and grabbing his head before falling backwards onto the mat, planting the opponent face-first. The move has been used by various professional wrestlers like Mil Muertes (Straight to Hell), Shelton Benjamin (Paydirt), Montel Vontavious Porter (the Play of the Day/305) and R-Truth (Lil' Jimmy). Liv Morgan uses this move as her finisher when her opponent is standing with the support of the ring ropes which she calls the ObLIVion.
A slight variation of the flatliner, this move sees a wrestler perform exactly the same set-up but instead of falling backward immediately, they lift the opponent before dropping them face-first into the mat, making it similar to a flapjack. It was innovated by Chris Kanyon. Baron Corbin's finisher is a variant of this move called the End of Days while Angelina Love uses the move as a signature (previously a finisher) called Lights Out. Another variation of this move involves using a pumphandle lift where the wrestler sets the opponent up for a pumphandle hold and then lifts them into the execution of the move. Pete Dunne uses this variation as a finisher previously calling it Drop Dead but now known as the Bitter End. Austin Theory uses a flipping version of this move in which, to a bent over opponent, he hooks his opponent's near arm with his far arm and hooks their near leg with his near arm. He then lifts the opponent off the mat flipping them in a 450 style motion forwards while simultaneously falling backwards to catch the falling them with his near arm completing the rotation and dropping them into the facebuster. He calls this move Ataxia. Damian Priest recently started using this move as a finisher after Cody Rhodes returned to the WWE in 2022.
Another variation of the flatliner, this move sees a wrestler grab their opponent around their neck and lean them backwards. The wrestler then swings their opponent around, slamming them face-first into the mat. Alex Shelley uses it as one of his pinfall finishers which is called Shellshock. Bray Wyatt used this maneuver as his finisher, which was referred to as Sister Abigail. NJPW wrestler Switchblade Jay White uses a variation called Blade Runner. Knux calls it the Knuxout. Alexa Bliss currently uses this move as a finisher but with a different twist. Lexis King uses a snap variation of the move called The Coronation.

Training for the ACFT: The Standing Power Throw
Updated: May 1, 2021
The Standing Power Throw (SPT), commonly referred to as the reverse overhead medicine ball toss, is the primary test for power in the new Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT).
Before we dive in, here are a few concepts you must understand in order to best train for the SPT:
Power is the product of Force and Velocity.
In weight training, force is easily defined as the load lifted.
Velocity is the distance the load travels divided by the time of travel (think miles per hour - in this case, meters per second is more appropriate).
Relative to training for strength, training for power is done by moving lighter loads rapidly.
Consider the difference between the two lifts shown here.
The snatch is an expression of power.
Despite a considerably lower amount of weight, the rapid triple extension of the hips, knees, and ankles quickly moves the load a relatively long distance.
According to the equation above, this results in the production of a large amount of power.
Many of the physiological adaptations that result in the ability to display this sort of power are motor fitness related.
On the contrary, the physiological adaptations that result in ""the Mountain's"" ability to deadlift a literal ton are the result of training focused on developing his muscular strength (a component of physical fitness, not motor fitness).
Unlike training for power, training for maximal strength is usually done by lifting loads greater than 80% of a 1-repetition maximum for several sets of about 5 repetitions.
Measures of absolute strength like the Maximum Deadlift (MDL), event 1 of the ACFT, generally do not take into consideration distance or time and are therefore not traditionally measures of power; the only value that matters in the MDL is the load lifted or force.
The SPT is a wholly different measure; performance in this event is determined by how far the ball travels (distance), which is a direct result of how rapidly and forcefully the performer executes triple extension.
Triple extension.
Simply put, this means moving from a squat to an extended body position by eliminating the bend in the hips, knees, and ankles.
When this is done in a rapid, coordinated manner with the force directed straight down into the ground, the result is a vertical jump.
Triple extension is also present in lifts like the clean and snatch and while sprinting.
According to conventional strength and conditioning wisdom, improvements in the efficiency, coordination, and speed of triple extension can contribute to increased power production and a boon to athletic performance.
While the SPT is one proven way to measure power in an athlete, simply repeating the test, again and again, is not the most efficient way to build power.
Instead, the military athlete will need to train like a field sport athlete.
Here’s how:
Get stronger - conduct heavy-weight resistance training to build the trunk and posterior chain using compound, multi-joint movements like the squat and deadlift.
Get more efficient - conduct light-weight resistance training to refine motor patterns and train your body to recruit motor units maximally; move lightweight in a ballistic manner with loaded squat jumps and/or trap-bar deadlift jumps - the weight in these exercises must be light enough to allow for very rapid triple extension.
The two contested Olympic lifts (Snatch and Clean & Jerk) and their many variants would also fall into this category but may require a degree of technical competence that makes learning to Olympic lift unnecessary for the purposes of improving ACFT performance.
Get plyometric - conduct a broad variety of unloaded jumps to stimulate neuromuscular characteristics that allow for greater force production; start with consecutive broad jumps and tuck jumps and move to depth jumps.

ACFT Standing Power Throw is an event in the new army fitness test, ACFT, that assesses a soldier’s upper body strength and power.
The Standing Power Throw Exercise in ACFT is the second event of the test.
It represents your ability to move people and equipment quickly and explosively.
This test often uses a 10-pound medicine ball to work your leg, core, shoulder, and back muscles.
The soldier is required to throw a medicine ball (10 pounds) as far as possible; more points will be awarded for the furthest throw depending on the age and gender of the soldier.
Think about the standing power throw like a keg toss. You take a 10-pound medicine ball and heave it backward over your head, trying to achieve maximum distance. Distance is measured when the ball makes the first impact on the field.
On the moderate effort scale of physical exertion jobs, the minimum to pass this test will be 4.5 meters standing power throw distance achieved. In the significant effort job category, it will be 6.5 meters. And on the heavy or infantry job scale, it might be higher.
And even though we attribute different effort levels to various jobs in the army, PAM 611 21, another army reference for you guys, still needs to delineate what jobs fall into what efforts for PT.
So we can guess that the heaviest level in this event will be a maximum of 12.5 meters and a minimum of eight meters in your power throw.
The Standing Power Throw is designed to promote explosive power. So when you think about how to apply this power in your daily duties, think about throwing stuff into the back of a deuce or over an obstacle, racks, and boxes of MREs.
Refer to the acft standards chart to get a comprehensive view of all the standards. Below are the minimum ACFT Standing Power Throw requirements to pass this event:

Other important ACFT Standards include the following:
How To Do A Standing Power Throw
The perfect trajectory is going to be about a 45-degree angle. So when you let this ball go, it will almost feel like your ball is traveling up, but it’s not.
So the soldier will grab his ball and stand wide enough to swing it between his legs for preparatory movements.
And then, he will explicitly open the hip, open the chest, extend the arms, and let go of the ball.
When training to improve your standing power throw, it’s important to incorporate exercises like explosive hip-hinging movements such as box jumps, big kettlebell swings, deadlifts, etc.
ACFT: Best Standing Power Throw Technique
Standing power throw, throw release point.
When you launch the ball on your throw, you want the ball to travel at a 45-degree angle. But if you wait too long to release the ball (above your head), the ball will go straight back.
It will only travel a little far, at least in the air. So you might have the most explosive throw, but you’re just going to throw it straight to the ground.
And, if you release the ball too early (your hands too close to the ground), the ball will go straight up and will not travel far, and nobody measures how high you throw it; it’s how far you throw it behind you.
The optimal release point is where your elbows are slightly above your eyes or forehead level, roughly 45 degrees to your body. A lot of the skill involves when you release that ball.
Another essential technique is using your hips as much as possible, not as much lower back.
You want to get the extension, which means going from bent to straight or extended from your hips and not as much there because your lower back is not nearly as strong as your glutes are.
So again, release the ball when your arms are roughly 45 degrees to your body; that gives you the best chance to maximize your distance.
SPT Test Instructions
Standing Power Throw is placing your heels in front of the throw line (also called the break line), throwing the ball over your head, and using explosive power to throw the ball as far as possible.
Here are the Army’s official directives to the SPT.
During the exercise, your feet can leave the ground, but if you touch or go over the throw line upon landing, it will be considered a fault.

5 Essential Exercises for Building Arm Strength for Throwing
Are you wondering how to build arm strength for throwing? Do you want to throw harder and farther than ever before? Then get ready to learn the five essential exercises for building arm strength for throwing.
In this article, we'll be looking at exercises that target specific joints and muscles in the arm and provide comprehensive knowledge on different drills, stretches, and mobility work to help increase throwing power. With the right kind of training and discipline, you can pump up your arm strength and achieve impressive throwing feats.
Band Pull Aparts
Building arm strength for throwing is a must for any throwing athlete. The essential exercise? Band pull aparts. These exercises improve posture, strengthen the upper back and shoulder muscles, increase shoulder mobility and stability, and prevent injuries. Plus they activate the upper back and warm up the muscles of the shoulder and upper body - key to throwing with power and accuracy. Do them as part of your warm up routine or in-season/off-season training program. Regular band pull aparts will help you develop strength & stability needed to throw powerfully & accurately!
Benefits
Band pull aparts are great for improving posture, strengthening the upper back and shoulder muscles, increasing shoulder mobility and stability, and avoiding injuries. They're an ideal way to activate the upper back before a throwing session. Plus, they can boost throwing power and velocity by toning up the rotator cuff and deceleration muscles. Baseballers and softballers can use this exercise to stay injury-free while maintaining arm strength for a long career - making band pull aparts an essential part of any throwing routine!
How to Perform
To perform band pull aparts, grasp the ends of a resistance band with both hands. Hold it at chest level with your arms extended and pull the band apart, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Position your arms at shoulder height - one below the other - with the higher arm strapped to the elastic band. Alternatively, use a light dumbbell for added difficulty. Keep your forearm parallel to the floor and keep contact between your body and shoulder blades. It's recommended to do three sets of fifteen reps when done as part of a workout.
The elevated external rotation burnout is another exercise that targets rotator cuff external rotators. Secure an elastic band around one arm and anchor it to a wall at shoulder height on its side; position arms at shoulder height - one below the other - with a higher arm strapped to the elastic band. This exercise can help demonstrate the importance of external rotation, like a drag racer needs room to slow down.
For prone scarecrow exercise, you need only a resistance band; this will strengthen external rotators and improve endurance too! To build arm strength & throwing power perform these exercises regularly: baseball & softball players will stay healthy & have a long career!
Band External Rotations
Band external rotations are a key exercise for boosting arm strength when throwing. They focus on the shoulder's external rotators, helping to build up the muscles used in the throwing motion. This exercise is great for increasing velocity, as well as strengthening the rotator cuff and improving shoulder mechanics.
These muscles also help reduce excessive load on the shoulder joint, which is essential for having a long softball career. By doing band external rotations regularly, you can improve your posture and strengthen your infraspinatus muscle, rear delts and teres minor.
Benefits
Band external rotations are an effective way to beef up arm muscles and boost throwing velocity. Specifically, they target the infraspinatus muscle - the primary one used for throwing. Strengthening these external rotators helps reduce the load on the shoulder joint, which is key for softball players who need to throw with consistent power over a long career. Plus, it improves shoulder mechanics and posture for more accurate throws. Band external rotations also build strength in deltoids, serratus anterior (proctor) and teres minor - all essential muscles for throwing. So if you want to increase your throwing velocity while strengthening your arms and shoulders, this exercise is definitely worth trying out!
How to Perform
To perform band external rotations, grasp the middle of the band with slight tension, about shoulder width apart. Kneel down and secure it underneath your lower legs. Bend your arms 90 degrees and bring up your elbows so that your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Rotate them outward while keeping elbows at sides and forearms perpendicular to the floor.
Keep the band at elbow height and the anchor point should be at shoulder height for best results. Beginners may prefer latex bands over light dumbbells (1-2lb). Place a small rolled-up towel between ribs and arm when doing external rotation - this will protect the shoulder joint from injury.
Remember to pull from an anchor point externally in order to target external rotators which need strengthening for improved throwing velocity. Keep elbows at sides and forearms perpendicular for optimal outcomes - following these guidelines will ensure you get the most out of exercise!
Dumbbell External Rotation
The next exercise to build arm strength for throwing? Dumbbell external rotation. This exercise specifically targets the muscles used for decelerating the throwing arm - those that help keep the shoulder healthy and reduce injury risk. Strengthening rotator cuff muscles and promoting scapular movement and stability, dumbbell external rotation helps maintain shoulder health. Incorporate it into your routine to reduce shoulder injuries and improve stability and strength of the shoulder complex.
Benefits
Dumbbell external rotation is an excellent exercise for building arm strength for throwing, offering many advantages. It strengthens the rotator cuff muscles responsible for slowing down the throwing arm, promoting scapular movement and stability while reducing shoulder injury risk. Additionally, it limits internal rotation of the shoulder, which can cause labrum injuries. Having strong decelerators is essential to any baseball player who wants a long career in the sport. Incorporate dumbbell external rotation into your training routine to build arm strength and reduce shoulder injury risks!
How to Perform
To perform dumbbell external rotation correctly and safely, ensure your shoulder blades are down and back, core is engaged, arms at shoulder height and elbows bent at a 90 degree angle. Keep the elbow angle at 90 degrees while rotating your arms outward to a 90 degree angle. Use light dumbbells to increase difficulty of the exercise.

Elevated External Rotation Burnouts
Elevated external rotation burnouts are an ideal way to bolster arm strength for throwing and offer other advantages. This exercise is a successful method to enhance shoulder strength and stability. It helps fortify the internal and external rotators of the shoulder, which is essential for any baseball or softball player aiming to have a long career. Additionally, it can improve posture, prevent shoulder and neck issues, and balance out the power of the internal and external rotators. With proper execution, elevated external rotation burnouts can help build arm strength for throwing while also improving overall performance.
This exercise can be done using either a band or light dumbbells and incorporated into any training program. By focusing on correct form and executing exercises quickly, baseball and softball players can increase their throwing power and accuracy while simultaneously strengthening their arms and shoulders.
Benefits
Elevated external rotation burnouts are a great way to build arm strength and reap many rewards. This exercise targets the rotator cuff muscles, which are essential for baseball or softball players. It can improve posture and protect against shoulder and neck issues in the future. Plus, these exercises help balance internal and external rotators - key for any athlete wanting a long career.
These advantages make elevated external rotation burnouts an important part of building arm strength for throwing. By strengthening arm muscles and shoulder muscles, athletes can increase their throwing power and accuracy. Moreover, this exercise helps prevent shoulder/neck problems that come with throwing. When done correctly, elevated external rotation burnouts can help any athlete reach their peak performance!
How to Perform
To build arm strength for throwing, there are a few essential exercises that you should include in your routine. Elevated external rotation burnouts are one of these. This exercise can be done with a band or light dumbbells and requires the elbows to stay at the side. Focus on spreading the arms as far as possible and executing quickly while keeping shoulder blades together throughout.
Incorporate these into your regular routine to build arm strength needed for improved throwing power and accuracy. When performing elevated external rotation burnouts, keep elbows at the side, spread arms wide, execute quickly - all while maintaining shoulder blade connection. Following these guidelines will help athletes build arm strength necessary for better crow hop, throwing power and accuracy.
Push-Ups
Push-ups are a fantastic addition to any upper body workout. They target the chest, arms, shoulders and back muscles - making them a great choice for boosting strength in these areas. Plus, they can also help build leg strength and engage your core - so you get an all-round fitness boost!
Moreover, push-ups are ideal for improving arm health and reducing injury risk for throwers. Incorporating them into your routine will give you stronger arms and more throwing power.
Benefits
Push-ups are a fantastic way to build arm strength. This section will explore the advantages of this exercise. Push-ups are an ideal choice for those seeking to increase their arm strength as they target multiple muscle groups in the upper body simultaneously. Furthermore, push-ups can stimulate metabolism and blood circulation, which can benefit overall health.
Push-ups also help strengthen the legs as they require one leg to support the body. Finally, push-ups are a great tool for improving arm health and helping athletes have a long career in their sport.
In summary, push-ups offer many benefits such as building arm strength, targeting multiple muscle groups, stimulating metabolism and blood circulation, strengthening legs and aiding athletes with long careers in sports.
How to Perform
Now that we've explored the perks of each exercise, let's dive into how to do them. Push-ups are typically done with your body in a plank position, hands slightly wider than shoulders. Bend your arms and lower yourself until your chest nearly touches the ground then straighten out to push back up to starting point. To make it more difficult, use a medicine ball or try doing one-legged push-ups. Remember general exercise guidelines like exhaling as you lift and keeping your back straight throughout the workout. Doing these exercises regularly can help build arm strength and enhance throwing ability!
Summary
Building arm strength is essential for any softball player who wants to throw with accuracy and power. Unfortunately, due to overuse or improper technique, players can be prone to shoulder injuries. The right training routine that incorporates exercises designed to build arm strength and promote stability can help reduce the risk of injury and improve throwing performance.
Five essential exercises for building arm strength are Band Pull Aparts, Band External Rotations, Dumbbell External Rotation, Elevated External Rotation Burnouts, and Push-Ups. Each exercise provides a specific set of physical benefits by focusing on a particular area of muscles such as strengthening the rotator cuff, improving posture and balance, and increasing contraction speed.
By following correct form and incorporating these exercises into their regular training routine, athletes can safely build the arm strength necessary for improving their throwing performance.

Takedowns in wrestling are awarded 1,2,4 or 5 points depending on the how the throw is performed and the landing position of the opponent. A five point technique is a grand amplitude throw where the opponent lands in a position of immediate danger. Earning the most points for a single throw these throws are the most rewarding in competition.
United world wrestling defines a 5 point throw as:
Breaking this down grand amplitude can be achieved from a neutral standing position or on the ground where the opponent is in the “parterre” position.
Achieving 5 points from a standing throw requires the opponent to be lifted from the ground loosing all contact with the matt, with control the opponent should be thrown in a sweeping curve landing in direct and immediate danger. The landing of the throw is important here – landing the opponent so the line of their back is less than 90 degrees from the canvas making them in danger of a pin will gain the fifth point. Landing the opponent without danger of the pin could be considered a 4 point throw.
From the ground a 5 points throw can be achieved by completing a lift from the ground where the opponent is thrown in a sweeping curve and once again landing in a danger position.
5 point throws can be difficult to achieve but are highly rewarding on the score card if executed correctly. Check out the video below to see examples of 5 point throws in competition.

What is freestyle wrestling: Rules, scoring, and Olympic styles
Freestyle is one of two wrestling styles contested in the Olympic Games. It origins from catch-as-catch-can wrestling, and also mixes Judo and Sambo techniques. This fighting style appeared in Great Britain and the United States in the first place. According to the International amateur wrestling federation, it is one of six styles of martial arts today.
Freestyle Wrestling: Rules And Scoring
Here is a brief paragraph about the rules of freestyle wrestling combat. There are many ways to win the fight, and we’ll get to know you with all of them. Plus, this article focuses on the Olympic styles of this discipline, the history of rule changes, and the comparison between traditional wrestling styles and Greco-Roman with a freestyle in the competitions.
Timing
The typical freestyle wrestling combat is divided into two three-minute periods, with 30 seconds of break between them. The period lasts for two minutes in under-15, cadets, and veterans competitions.
Two fighters are fighting on the special mats, and the goal of the combat is to pin the opponent’s shoulders to the mat for a short period. If a wrestler manages to keep the foe’s shoulder blades pressed towards the mats, the bout is over.
Ways To Win
This is not Greco Roman, so wins by fall are rare, as the opponent won’t let you control him on his back. Yet, there are many other ways to end the bout victorious. There are tons of throws and trips from a standing position that can bring you points.
When a fighter hurts himself, surrenders, or gets disqualified, the fight is also over. But maybe the most often way to leave the mat with your hand raised is victory via points. The different maneuvers and throws or takedowns bring 1 to 5 points, depending on their difficulty (arching throws or popular “grand amplitude throw” will bring the maximum number on judges’ scorecards). Throws with big amplitude should bring you at least three points. Please look at the instructional video below.
The reversal, or a change from the bottom to a dominant position, and keeping the opponent to the mat can also leave a better impression on the judges. Break the rule or do an illegal hold and the referee might sanction you with a penalty!
Sometimes a wrestler wins via decision. It happens when there was no finish or a ten-point lead. Then the fighter with the greater number of points scored leaves the hall victorious.
When one fighter leads by a ten-point lead, the match ends. It can happen in the first ten seconds, but it doesn’t matter, 10 points ahead on the scorecards means the fighter won the bout and the referee stops the match. The leader is declared the winner by the technical superiority.
What If The Points Are Equal At The End Of The Bout?
If the score is tied at the end of the fight, the fighter with the least number of cautions wins. When this parameter is the same, the mat warrior who scored the last point of the match ends up with his hand raised.
Olympic Wrestling
Only two styles of wrestling are allowed in the Olympics – Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling (which also allows competitions for women).
Fighters must wear a singlet (one-piece wrestling garment made of spandex), a special pair of wrestling shoes designed to boost flexibility and mobility, usually made with rubber soles, and a handkerchief in the case of bleeding. Usually, one competitor wears blue, while the other one is in a red one because of easier scoring. Headgear is optional, but fighters rarely wear it, despite it wears the potential of developing cauliflower ear.
Wrestling Rules Changed To Keep The Sport In Olympics
FILA’s bureau made significant rule changes before the 2020 Olympics to keep the sport in the Olympic family. Instead of three two-minute periods, the bout lasts for two three-minute periods, plus the cumulative scoring table replaced the two-out-of-three round system.
For example, now you can win the first round, do nothing in the second and lose the fight. When the matches lasted for three rounds, fighters who were up on the scorecards were stalling a lot in the third because of the dominant performance in the first two periods.
Olympic Freestyle Wrestling Types: The Difference Between Freestyle And Greco-Roman Wrestling
In Greco-Roman, fighters don’t tend to keep their hips so close to the ground and rather choose to grab their foes around the waist or neck. A more liberal ruleset gives more options to the freestyle wrestlers in the freestyle competition, so they can attack knees, thighs, even ankles, and feet.
Unlike Greco roman wrestling, fighters start the bout in a very low stance to defend their legs. In a classic Greco-Roman bout, the fighter cannot score points by grabbing the opponent’s legs as it will result in a penalty, plus a passive wrestler can defend on his stomach for a prolonged time. In freestyle, inactivity might lead to a sanction, judges don’t like stalling and doing nothing – bouts are way more dynamic.
But here is the one similarity – the fighters with the greater number of points win the battle. 🙂
Frequently Asked Questions on Freestyle Wrestling
Is freestyle wrestling real?
Of course, it is. If you think it’s a joke, try wrestling with a freestyle wrestler for one round. But don’t cry when he slams you on the mat and holds you down until the end or hurts you badly with a violent throw.
How many Olympic wrestling weight classes are there?
The weight classes for the male competitors in the Olympic Games look like this (upper limit): 55 kg (121.25 pounds), 60 kg (132.25 pounds), 66 kg (145.5 pounds), 74 kg (163 pounds), 84 kg (185 pounds), 96 kg (211.5 pounds), and 120 kg (264.5 pounds).There were ten Olympic freestyle wrestling classes for women (50 kg, 53 kg, 55 kg, 57 kg, 59 kg, 62 kg, 65 kg, 68 kg, 72 kg, and 76 kg) for females who participate in the World Championships, but after the 2020 Summer Olympic games, there will be only six weight divisions (50 kg, 53 kg, 57 kg, 62 kg, 68 kg and 76 kg) in women’s freestyle wrestling.
What is the difference between wrestling and freestyle wrestling?
In Greco-Roman wrestling, you mustn’t grab the opponent under the level of his waist, whilst these moves are perfectly legal in the world of freestyle wrestling. There are minor differences in the scoring system and rules, as freestyle wrestling offers a more liberal rule set. But leg trips and throws are the most obvious for a newbie.
When did freestyle wrestling start?
Freestyle wrestling appeared in the Olympic games for the first time in 1904 in St. Louis. It was not a part of the Olympic family back in Stockholm in 1912, but after World War I, it has been present in every single edition of the games.
What is the difference between freestyle and folkstyle wrestling?
Folkstyle wrestling is more focused on bringing the opposing wrestler to the mat and controlling him until the end of the bout, while freestyle wrestling puts more focus on exposure points.When you’re on your back in folkstyle wrestling, your goal is to get away from a bad spot. In a freestyle wrestling match, you’re trying to avoid being turned/exposed from the bottom position by any means necessary.

Wrestling, an ancient sport known for its physicality and technical finesse, operates on a scoring system that determines match outcomes. Understanding the nuances of wrestling points, scoring methods, and victory conditions is crucial for wrestlers and enthusiasts alike to appreciate the sport's intensity and strategies.

Wrestling points play a crucial role in defining the best wrestling matches of all time, influencing the intensity, drama, and ultimate outcome. The duration of a wrestling match typically spans three periods, each lasting two minutes for high school matches and three minutes for collegiate and international competitions. Winning a wrestling match involves accumulating points through various maneuvers like takedowns, reversals, and near falls, showcasing technical finesse and strategic prowess. Wrestling matches encompass diverse types, including freestyle, Greco-Roman, folkstyle, and professional wrestling, each with distinct rules and scoring systems. The difference between a wrestling match and a meet lies in their scope—a match generally refers to a singular bout between two wrestlers, while a meet incorporates multiple matches involving different wrestlers or teams competing against each other. In the best wrestling matches of all time, the accumulation of points, strategic moves, and often the dramatic moments involving scoring fluctuations or a decisive victory by points or a fall, all contribute to the match's legacy, marking it as an exceptional display of skill, determination, and strategy on the mat.
How Does Wrestling Work: Unveiling the Match Dynamics
Wrestling matches typically involve two competitors aiming to outmaneuver each other on the mat. Victory can be achieved through multiple routes, including scoring more points than the opponent, winning by a fall, securing a technical superiority, or garnering a decision by the match officials.
How to Score in Wrestling: Earning Points on the Mat
Wrestlers accumulate points through various maneuvers and techniques during a match. Takedowns, reversals, escapes, and near falls are among the actions that result in point acquisition. Each successful maneuver contributes to a wrestler's point tally, thereby influencing the match's outcome.
How Do You Win a Wrestling Match: Understanding Victory Conditions
Victory in wrestling can be achieved through different means. A win by fall occurs when a wrestler pins both of the opponent's shoulders to the mat for a specific duration, resulting in an immediate victory. Technical superiority, earned by accumulating a substantial point lead, also secures a win. Additionally, a decision by match officials declares a winner based on scoring criteria and performance.
The Point System in Wrestling: Assigning Values to Moves
Wrestling employs a point system wherein specific moves carry predetermined values. For instance, a takedown typically earns two points, while near falls or exposures can accumulate two to four points based on the duration and positioning.
What Does Winning by Fall Mean in Wrestling: The Ultimate Victory
Winning by fall, also known as a pin, signifies a wrestler's triumph by securing both of the opponent's shoulders on the mat for a specified duration. This outcome represents an immediate and decisive victory in wrestling matches.

Freestyle wrestling has been part of the Olympics regularly since 1920 but women’s freestyle wrestling was included in the programme only from Athens 2004.
Probably the most popular among the many styles of wrestling practised around the world, freestyle wrestling made its debut at the Olympics at the 1904 St Louis Summer Games.
However, it wasn’t until the 1920 edition in Antwerp that freestyle wrestling became a permanent fixture at the Olympic Games alongside Greco Roman wrestling, which had been a regular discipline at the quadrennial event since 1908.
Both styles of wrestling – Greco Roman and freestyle – have been a major part of the Olympics since and also featured at the latest edition at Tokyo.
Here’s everything you need to know about Olympic freestyle wrestling.
Freestyle wrestling rules and scoring
Timings
A typical freestyle wrestling bout, much like Greco-Roman, is divided into two periods of three minutes each with a 30-second break in between. For official Under-15, cadets and veteran competitions, the periods are curtailed to two minutes each.
Two competing wrestlers face each other on a mat, nine-metre in diameter, with the primary objective of pinning the opponent’s shoulders to the mat for a short duration of time, that hands the wrestler an instant victory by ‘fall’.
Ways to win
In modern-day wrestling, however, particularly big events like the Olympics and the World Championships, victory by fall is a rarity. There are, however, several other ways to win a bout.
The most common, perhaps, is victory by points. Wrestlers can try and score points by executing legal holds, throws, takedowns, manoeuvring the opponent to expose his back to the mat for several seconds or by executing reversals.
Reversals involve negating an opponent’s position of advantage from a defensive position and gaining control of the situation.
Moves carry points in accordance to their degree of difficulty and a single move can carry from anywhere between 1 to 5 points. High scoring moves, generally arching throws, generally carry the maximum number of points.
Players can also gain points if his opponent causes infractions, like executing illegal holds, trying to flee a hold rather than defend it, being too negative or passive and so on. These often result in cautions. Accumulating three cautions during a bout automatically results in the guilty wrestler getting disqualified.
At the end of the six-minute period, the total scores are tallied and the wrestler with more points wins. In case of a tie, the wrestler who has scored the maximum number of points from a single move is declared the winner.
What if the points are equal at the end of a bout?
If wrestlers are level in that aspect as well, the least number of cautions and final point scored are taken in order as the tie-breaking factors.
In the event of a freestyle wrestler building up a 10-point advantage over his opponent at any stage of the match, the bout is declared over and the leader is declared the winner by technical superiority.
Freestyle wrestling techniques
While scoring systems and format of matches are more or less the same for freestyle and Greco Roman wrestling, the crucial difference between the two styles is the use of legs. In Greco-Roman, holding the opponent below the waist or using the legs for any defensive or offensive purpose is strictly prohibited.
In freestyle wrestling, however, no such restrictions apply. Inspired from catch-as-catch-can wrestling - a combination of multiple wrestling styles and combat sport popular in English carnivals during the late 1800s - freestyle wrestling allows a lot more freedom as it allows attacking the opponent’s hips, legs and feet.
As a result, freestyle bouts generally start with wrestlers taking a very low stance in order to defend the legs.
Also, unlike Greco Roman wrestling where wrestlers need to stay in contact with the opponent through the course of a throw, freestyle wrestlers are allowed to let go and re-establish contact afterwards to complete a move.
These facets allow for a much larger variety of techniques to be utilised, making freestyle wrestling a much more fluid style than, perhaps, a more rigid Greco-Roman variant. Smooth transitions to string together moves become imperative in freestyle wrestling, with rhythm playing a big part.
“With freestyle, transitions are more important. We try to be more fluid with our movements...You can utilize more of your body and more of your opponent’s body because you can make more contact.” - US Wrestler J’den Cox
Passivity in freestyle wrestling
Modern-day wrestling rules are devised to reward active wrestlers and penalising passive wrestlers attempting to employ negative or passive tactics, like being overly defensive.
In freestyle wrestling, the first instance of passivity from a wrestler earns them a verbal warning from the referee. If they continue to be inactive, a 30-second mandatory scoring window is issued.
If either wrestler manages to score within this window, no penalty point is awarded. However, if neither can score within that 30-second window, the opponent of the designated passive wrestler is awarded a technical point.
However, in case the referee deems a wrestler to be passive with less than 30 seconds remaining on the clock for either period, they immediately receive a caution and the active wrestler is awarded a point.
In freestyle wrestling, passivity calls are also utilised to stimulate a match if neither wrestler manages to score a point within the first two minutes of the first period.
In such a case, the referee must identify the more passive wrestler of the two and enforce the mandatory 30-second scoring window on them.
Olympic freestyle wrestling
While Greco-Roman wrestling featured in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, freestyle wrestling made it into the Summer Games’ programme during the 1904 edition in St Louis, with only local wrestlers from the United States participating.
It was also the first time in Olympic history where weight category events were introduced. The Greco Roman event in 1896 was a unified event without any weight class divisions.
Freestyle wrestling was taken off the Olympic schedule for the 1912 Games but made a return in the 1920 edition.
It has been a permanent fixture in the Olympics calendar since then but it was only at the Athens 2004 Games that women’s freestyle wrestling was introduced. Greco Roman, meanwhile, is still exclusively a men’s event.

Mastering the Art of Takedowns in Freestyle Wrestling: A Comprehensive Guide
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling. If you are passionate about this dynamic combat sport and want to enhance your skills in taking down opponents, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we will delve into the essential techniques, strategies, and training drills that will empower you to dominate your opponents on the wrestling mat. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your takedown abilities, this guide is designed to provide you with valuable insights and expert advice to take your freestyle wrestling game to the next level.
Understanding the Basics of Takedowns
Takedowns are a fundamental aspect of freestyle wrestling. They involve swiftly and strategically taking down your opponent to gain control or score points. Understanding the basics of takedowns is crucial for any wrestler looking to excel in this dynamic sport.
Different Types of Takedowns
Single Leg Takedown: This is one of the most common takedown techniques used in freestyle wrestling. It involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs and swiftly driving them off balance to bring them down to the mat.
Double Leg Takedown: Similar to the single leg takedown, the double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent’s legs and using your body weight to knock them off balance and bring them down.
High Crotch Takedown: This takedown technique requires you to shoot in towards your opponent’s legs, driving your shoulder into their midsection. From there, you can lift and maneuver them to the ground.
Fireman’s Carry: The fireman’s carry is a more advanced takedown that involves throwing your opponent over your shoulder while maintaining control of their upper body. It requires good timing and technique but can be highly effective when executed correctly.
Strategies for Setting up Takedowns
Establishing Control: Before attempting a takedown, it’s essential to establish control over your opponent. This can be achieved through hand fighting, maintaining good posture, and creating angles to disrupt their balance.
Creating Openings: Look for opportunities to create openings for takedowns by feinting or faking attacks. This can force your opponent to react, opening up opportunities for you to execute a takedown.
Using Combinations: Utilize combinations of attacks to keep your opponent guessing and off balance. By chaining together different takedown attempts, you can increase your chances of successfully executing a takedown.
Key Techniques for Executing Takedowns
Level Change: A crucial aspect of executing a successful takedown is the ability to change levels. This involves lowering your body position while maintaining good posture, making it harder for your opponent to defend against your takedown attempts.
Explosiveness and Speed: Takedowns require explosive and quick movements. By training your explosiveness and speed through drills and exercises, you can enhance your ability to execute takedowns effectively.
Maintaining Balance: It’s important to maintain your own balance throughout the takedown process. This allows you to stay in control and quickly transition to other techniques if necessary.
Finishing the Takedown: Once you have initiated a takedown, focus on finishing it strong. This involves driving through your opponent, using your entire body to maintain control, and securing a dominant position on the mat.
Mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling takes time, practice, and a deep understanding of the basics. By familiarizing yourself with different types of takedowns, employing effective strategies, and honing key techniques, you can elevate your takedown game and become a formidable force on the wrestling mat.
Developing Strength and Conditioning
In order to excel in freestyle wrestling and master the art of takedowns, it is crucial to focus on developing strength and conditioning. This aspect of training plays a vital role in enhancing performance on the mat. By incorporating specific exercises for building core strength, cardiovascular training for endurance, and emphasizing the importance of flexibility and agility, wrestlers can greatly improve their overall abilities.
Specific Exercises for Building Core Strength
Core strength is fundamental in freestyle wrestling as it provides stability and power for executing takedowns effectively. Incorporating specific exercises targeting the core muscles can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. Some effective exercises for building core strength include:
Plank: The plank is a simple yet highly effective exercise for strengthening the core. Start by assuming a push-up position and then lower your forearms to the ground. Hold this position while maintaining a straight line from your head to your feet. Aim to gradually increase the duration of the hold as your core strength improves.
Russian Twists: This exercise targets the oblique muscles, which are crucial for generating rotational power during takedowns. Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly, keeping your back straight. Hold a weight or medicine ball in front of your chest and twist your torso from side to side, touching the weight or ball to the ground on each side.
Leg Raises: Leg raises help strengthen the lower abdominal muscles, which are essential for explosive movements in wrestling. Lie on your back with your legs straight and your hands by your sides. Lift your legs off the ground while keeping them straight, and then slowly lower them back down without touching the ground. Repeat for multiple sets.
Cardiovascular Training for Endurance
Endurance is another crucial aspect of freestyle wrestling, as matches can be physically demanding and often require sustained effort. Incorporating cardiovascular training into your routine can greatly improve your endurance levels. Here are some effective cardiovascular exercises for wrestlers:
Running: Running is a great cardiovascular exercise that helps build endurance and stamina. Incorporate both steady-state running for longer durations and interval training to simulate the intensity of wrestling matches. Interval training involves alternating between high-intensity sprints and recovery periods.
Cycling: Cycling is a low-impact cardiovascular exercise that can be beneficial for wrestlers. Whether you prefer indoor cycling or hitting the roads, it provides an excellent way to improve your endurance. Vary the intensity of your rides by incorporating intervals or incorporating hill climbs to simulate the demands of wrestling.
Jumping Rope: Jumping rope is not only a great warm-up exercise but also an effective way to improve cardiovascular fitness. It is a high-intensity exercise that engages multiple muscle groups and helps improve coordination and footwork.
Importance of Flexibility and Agility
Flexibility and agility are key components of successful takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Being able to move swiftly and fluidly while maintaining balance is crucial for executing techniques effectively. Here are some important aspects to consider:
Dynamic Stretching: Incorporate dynamic stretching exercises into your warm-up routine before training or competing. Dynamic stretching involves continuous movement through a full range of motion and helps improve flexibility and joint mobility. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, and torso twists.
Plyometric Exercises: Plyometric exercises, such as box jumps or lateral bounds, help improve agility and explosive power. These exercises involve quick and powerful movements that enhance muscle elasticity and coordination.
Yoga or Pilates: Engaging in regular yoga or Pilates sessions can greatly improve flexibility, balance, and body control. These practices also promote core strength and stability, which are essential for executing takedowns with precision.
By incorporating these exercises and emphasizing the importance of strength and conditioning, core strength, cardiovascular training, flexibility, and agility, wrestlers can enhance their performance in freestyle wrestling and ultimately master the art of takedowns. Remember, consistent practice and dedication are key to achieving success in any sport.
Mastering the Mechanics of Takedowns
Proper Stance and Balance
In the world of freestyle wrestling, having a proper stance and balance is crucial to mastering the art of takedowns. Your stance determines your readiness and stability while engaging with your opponent. Here are some key points to remember:
Gripping and Controlling Techniques
Once you have established a solid stance, the gripping and controlling techniques play a vital role in executing successful takedowns. Here’s what you need to know:
Footwork and Timing
Apart from having a strong stance and effective gripping techniques, footwork and timing are essential components of mastering takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Consider the following factors:
By understanding and practicing the mechanics of takedowns, focusing on proper stance and balance, gripping and controlling techniques, as well as footwork and timing, you can elevate your freestyle wrestling skills to new heights. Mastering these fundamental aspects will greatly enhance your ability to execute effective takedowns and gain a competitive edge in the sport.
Countering and Defending Against Takedowns
Recognizing and Reacting to Opponent’s Attacks
In freestyle wrestling, the ability to recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks is crucial when countering and defending against takedowns. Being able to anticipate your opponent’s movements and understand their preferred techniques will give you a significant advantage in defending against their attacks.
To effectively recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks, it is essential to develop a keen sense of observation. Pay close attention to their footwork, body positioning, and any subtle cues that may indicate an impending takedown attempt. By studying your opponent’s patterns and tendencies, you can better prepare yourself to counter their attacks.
Quick reflexes and agility are key when reacting to your opponent’s attacks. As soon as you perceive an incoming takedown attempt, you must swiftly adjust your stance and position yourself to neutralize their attack. Maintaining a low center of gravity and keeping your balance will make it harder for your opponent to execute a successful takedown.
Effective Counter Techniques
Having a repertoire of effective counter techniques will greatly enhance your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are a few techniques that can be utilized to counter your opponent’s attacks:
Sprawl: The sprawl technique involves quickly extending your legs backward while dropping your hips to the mat. By doing so, you create a wider base and make it difficult for your opponent to secure a takedown.
Whizzer: The whizzer, also known as an overhook, is a defensive move where you use your arm to control your opponent’s attacking arm. This technique allows you to redirect their momentum and potentially gain an advantageous position.
Front Headlock: When your opponent attempts a takedown, you can react by securing a front headlock. This move involves wrapping your arms around your opponent’s head and controlling their upper body, preventing them from completing the takedown.
Granby Roll: The granby roll is an effective technique to counter a takedown and quickly regain control. It involves rolling away from your opponent’s attack while using your momentum to reverse the situation.
Defensive Strategies and Tactics
In addition to individual counter techniques, implementing defensive strategies and tactics can greatly improve your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are some defensive strategies to consider:
Maintain a Strong Base: By keeping a strong and balanced stance, you make it more challenging for your opponent to take you down. Focus on keeping your feet shoulder-width apart and distributing your weight evenly.
Hand Fighting: Engaging in hand fighting with your opponent can disrupt their attempts to initiate takedowns. By controlling their hands and wrists, you limit their ability to secure a successful takedown.
Circle and Angle: Instead of standing directly in front of your opponent, use circular footwork and angles to make it harder for them to shoot for a takedown. Constantly moving and changing angles forces your opponent to adjust and can create openings for counters.
Utilize Defensive Drills: Incorporate defensive drills into your training routine to improve your reflexes, timing, and defensive instincts. Practice scenarios where your opponent attempts takedowns, and focus on reacting quickly and effectively countering their attacks.
By recognizing and reacting to your opponent’s attacks, utilizing effective counter techniques, and implementing defensive strategies, you will enhance your ability to counter and defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Constant practice and refinement of these skills will lead to mastery and success on the wrestling mat.
Strategies for Competition
Creating an Effective Game Plan
Having a well-defined game plan is crucial in freestyle wrestling competitions. It allows wrestlers to approach matches with a strategic mindset, maximizing their chances of success. Here are some key steps to creating an effective game plan:
Study your opponent: Before the match, research and analyze your opponent’s previous performances. Look for patterns, strengths, and weaknesses that can be exploited during the bout. This information will help you develop a targeted strategy.
Identify your strengths: Assess your own wrestling style and identify your strongest techniques and moves. Build your game plan around these strengths to capitalize on your skills during the match.
Set specific objectives: Determine specific goals and objectives for the match. These could include scoring a certain number of takedowns, avoiding specific moves from your opponent, or dominating a particular position. Having clear objectives will keep you focused and motivated during the competition.
Practice your strategy: Once you have identified your game plan, practice it extensively during training sessions. Work on executing your chosen techniques and movements flawlessly to build muscle memory and confidence.
Analyzing and Exploiting Opponent’s Weaknesses
One of the most effective strategies in freestyle wrestling is identifying and exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses. By studying their previous matches and observing their style, you can develop a game plan that targets their vulnerabilities. Here’s how to go about it:
Watch their matches: Analyze your opponent’s previous matches to identify any recurring weaknesses or areas where they struggle. Pay attention to their reactions in different situations and take note of any recurring mistakes they make.
Identify common weaknesses: Once you have observed your opponent’s matches, look for common weaknesses that can be exploited. These could be technical flaws, predictable reactions, or vulnerabilities in certain positions. Understanding these weaknesses will help you plan your attacks accordingly.
Develop counter strategies: Based on the weaknesses you have identified, develop specific counter strategies. Practice techniques and moves that directly exploit your opponent’s vulnerabilities, allowing you to gain an advantage during the match.
Stay adaptable: While it is important to exploit your opponent’s weaknesses, it is equally crucial to adapt your strategy during the match. If your initial plan doesn’t yield the desired results, be prepared to make quick adjustments and capitalize on any new openings that arise.
Mental Preparation for Matches
Mental preparation plays a vital role in freestyle wrestling competitions. It helps wrestlers stay focused, confident, and resilient throughout the match. Here are some key aspects of mental preparation that can enhance your performance:
Visualization techniques: Before the match, spend time visualizing yourself executing your game plan flawlessly. Imagine each move, takedown, and counter in vivid detail. This mental rehearsal helps build confidence and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenges.
Positive self-talk: Replace negative thoughts and self-doubt with positive affirmations. Remind yourself of your strengths, skills, and previous successes. Repeat empowering phrases to boost your confidence and maintain a positive mindset.
Controlled breathing: Deep, controlled breathing techniques can help calm your nerves and reduce anxiety before and during the match. Practice rhythmic breathing exercises to center yourself and stay focused on the present moment.
Develop a pre-match routine: Establish a consistent pre-match routine that helps you get in the right mindset. This routine could include warm-up exercises, visualization sessions, or listening to motivational music. Having a routine creates a sense of familiarity and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenge.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of physical prowess and mental acuity. By strategizing effectively, exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses, and mentally preparing for matches, you can significantly enhance your performance on the mat.
Drills and Training Exercises
Partner Drills for Takedown Practice
One of the most effective ways to improve your takedown skills in freestyle wrestling is through partner drills. These drills allow you to practice your techniques in a controlled setting with a training partner. Here are some partner drills that can help you master the art of takedowns:
Double Leg Takedown Drill: Start by facing your partner in a wrestling stance. Initiate the drill by shooting in for a double leg takedown. Your partner should sprawl and defend while you focus on driving through and completing the takedown. Repeat this drill multiple times, alternating roles with your partner.
Single Leg Takedown Drill: Similar to the double leg takedown drill, this drill focuses on executing a single leg takedown. Begin by gripping your partner’s collar tie or wrist control, then quickly transition to a single leg attack. Your partner should defend by sprawling and countering. Practice this drill with both partners taking turns as the attacker and defender.
Hand Fighting Drill: Hand fighting is crucial for setting up takedowns and gaining control over your opponent. In this drill, focus on developing your hand fighting skills by engaging in controlled sparring with your partner. Work on establishing dominant grips, clearing ties, and creating openings for takedowns. Remember to maintain proper technique and intensity throughout the drill.
Solo Drills for Technique Refinement
In addition to partner drills, solo drills are essential for refining your takedown techniques and improving your overall performance in freestyle wrestling. These drills allow you to focus on specific movements and body mechanics without the need for a training partner. Here are some solo drills that can help you enhance your takedown skills:
Shadow Wrestling: Shadow wrestling involves simulating takedowns and defensive movements without a partner. Stand in front of a mirror or an imaginary opponent and practice your takedown techniques. Focus on proper footwork, hip movement, and penetration steps. Visualize your opponent’s reactions and work on your timing and precision.
Shot Drills: Shot drills are designed to improve your speed, explosiveness, and precision when shooting for takedowns. Set up a series of cones or markers on the ground, and practice shooting from various distances. Start slowly, focusing on proper form, and gradually increase your speed and intensity. Challenge yourself by incorporating level changes and fakes into your shots.
Resistance Band Drills: Resistance bands can be a valuable tool for developing strength and power in your takedown movements. Attach a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point and work on your takedown motions against the resistance. This will help you build explosive power and improve your ability to finish takedowns against tough opponents.
Live Wrestling and Scrimmage Sessions
While drills and solo exercises are essential for skill development, nothing can replicate the intensity and unpredictability of live wrestling. Engaging in live wrestling sessions and scrimmages is crucial for applying your techniques in real-time situations. Here are some tips for making the most of live wrestling sessions:
Focus on Applying Techniques: Use live wrestling sessions as an opportunity to practice the takedowns you’ve been drilling. Focus on executing your techniques against resisting opponents and adapting to their reactions. Pay attention to your positioning, timing, and setups during live situations.
Experiment and Learn: Live wrestling sessions provide a platform for experimentation and learning. Don’t be afraid to try new techniques or variations of existing ones. Take risks, analyze the outcomes, and learn from both successful and unsuccessful attempts. This will help you expand your arsenal of takedowns and develop a well-rounded skillset.
Seek Feedback and Spar with Different Partners: During live wrestling sessions, actively seek feedback from coaches, teammates, or more experienced wrestlers. They can provide valuable insights into your takedown techniques, positioning, and overall performance. Additionally, try to wrestle with a variety of partners to expose yourself to different styles and challenges.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires consistent practice, dedication, and a willingness to learn from both successes and failures. By incorporating partner drills, solo exercises, and live wrestling sessions into your training routine, you can significantly improve your takedown skills and become a formidable competitor in the sport.
In conclusion, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of technique, strength, and strategy. It is essential to understand the fundamentals of positioning, footwork, and timing to successfully execute takedowns. Additionally, building strength and endurance through regular training and conditioning is crucial for maintaining control and overpowering opponents. Moreover, having a strategic approach, such as setting up takedowns with feints or capitalizing on an opponent’s weaknesses, can greatly increase the chances of success. By continuously honing these skills and incorporating them into one’s training regimen, wrestlers can elevate their performance and become formidable competitors in the sport of freestyle wrestling.

Are you looking to dominate your opponents in freestyle wrestling matches? Whether you are a beginner or an experienced wrestler, having effective strategies can make all the difference in securing a victory.

From mastering takedowns to perfecting escapes, we will provide you with valuable insights and tips to enhance your freestyle wrestling skills. Get ready to take your wrestling game to the next level with these powerful strategies.
Understanding the Rules and Scoring System
Familiarizing yourself with the rules of freestyle wrestling
Before stepping onto the wrestling mat, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of the rules that govern freestyle wrestling. Familiarizing yourself with these rules will not only ensure that you compete within the boundaries of the sport but also give you an edge over your opponents.
In freestyle wrestling, the objective is to defeat your opponent by scoring more points or pinning them to the mat. The match consists of two three-minute periods, with a 30-second break in between. During the match, wrestlers engage in various techniques to gain control and score points.
Understanding the scoring system and how points are awarded
In freestyle wrestling, points are awarded based on specific actions and techniques executed during the match. It is crucial to understand how these points are awarded to effectively strategize and score against your opponent.
Here are the main ways points are awarded:
Takedown: A takedown is one of the fundamental techniques in freestyle wrestling. It involves gaining control over your opponent and taking them down to the mat while maintaining control. A successful takedown awards two points.
Escape: An escape is when a wrestler successfully breaks free from their opponent’s control while standing or on the mat. It awards one point.
Exposure: Exposure refers to exposing your opponent’s back or shoulders to the mat at an angle of less than 90 degrees. This technique leads to potential pinning situations and awards two or four points, depending on the duration of exposure.
Reversal: A reversal occurs when a wrestler, who is in the bottom position, manages to gain control over their opponent. It awards two points.
Penalty points: Penalty points may be awarded to the opponent for various rule violations, such as illegal holds or actions. These points are awarded to the opposing wrestler.
Understanding how each action contributes to the scoring system allows you to strategize and make calculated moves during the match.
Knowing the importance of takedowns, escapes, and exposures
Mastering the importance of takedowns, escapes, and exposures in freestyle wrestling can significantly impact your chances of winning matches. Each of these techniques plays a crucial role in scoring points and gaining control over your opponent.
Takedowns are essential in establishing dominance and control in a match. Executing successful takedowns not only grants you points but also puts your opponent on the defensive. It allows you to dictate the pace of the match and potentially open opportunities for further scoring.
Escapes are equally important, as they allow you to break free from your opponent’s control and regain a neutral standing position. By earning escape points, you can turn the tables and regain control of the match, putting yourself in a favorable position to score further.
Exposures are particularly significant, as they can lead to potential pinning situations. The longer you can expose your opponent’s back or shoulders to the mat, the higher the scoring potential. Mastering techniques that create exposures can provide you with an advantage, increasing your chances of securing a pinfall victory.
In conclusion, understanding the rules and scoring system of freestyle wrestling is vital for any wrestler aiming to win matches. By familiarizing yourself with the rules, comprehending how points are awarded, and recognizing the importance of takedowns, escapes, and exposures, you can develop effective strategies to outperform your opponents and achieve success in freestyle wrestling.
Developing Technical Skills
When it comes to freestyle wrestling, having strong technical skills is crucial for success on the mat. Developing these skills requires a combination of practice, dedication, and a solid understanding of the fundamental techniques. In this section, we will discuss three key areas to focus on when developing your technical skills.
Mastering basic wrestling techniques such as stance, footwork, and grips
To become a proficient freestyle wrestler, it is essential to master the basic wrestling techniques. This starts with developing a strong and balanced stance, which allows you to maintain control and move efficiently during a match. Your stance should be low, with your knees slightly bent and your weight evenly distributed.
Footwork is another fundamental aspect of wrestling that should not be overlooked. Proper footwork enables you to quickly change direction, maintain balance, and execute various moves effectively. Practice different footwork drills, such as shuffling, circling, and level changes, to improve your agility and speed on the mat.
In addition to stance and footwork, understanding and utilizing effective grips is essential in freestyle wrestling. Learning how to control your opponent’s wrists, head, and body can give you a significant advantage during a match. Experiment with different hand positions and grips, such as the collar tie, underhook, and overhook, to find what works best for your style of wrestling.
Learning effective takedown techniques like single-leg and double-leg takedowns
Takedowns play a crucial role in freestyle wrestling, as they allow you to score points by bringing your opponent to the mat. Two common takedown techniques that every wrestler should master are the single-leg and double-leg takedowns.
The single-leg takedown involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs and driving through to bring them down. This technique is effective for both offensive and defensive purposes. Practice shooting in quickly, securing the leg, and driving through your opponent to execute a successful single-leg takedown.
Similarly, the double-leg takedown focuses on attacking both of your opponent’s legs simultaneously. This move requires explosive power and proper timing. Work on your setups, level changes, and penetration steps to effectively execute a double-leg takedown.
Practicing defensive moves and counterattacks to prevent your opponent’s attacks
While mastering offensive techniques is crucial, it is equally important to develop defensive skills and counterattacks. Being able to prevent your opponent’s attacks can save you from giving up points and put you in a favorable position to score yourself.
Practicing defensive moves such as sprawls and front headlocks can help you evade your opponent’s takedown attempts. A sprawl involves quickly sprawling your legs back and dropping your hips to defend against a shot. Front headlocks, on the other hand, allow you to control your opponent’s head and arm, preventing them from executing a successful takedown.
In addition to defensive moves, mastering counterattacks can be a game-changer in freestyle wrestling. When your opponent initiates an attack, you can seize the opportunity to counter and score points. Techniques like the re-shot, cement mixer, and lateral drop can be effective counterattacks when executed with precision and timing.
By focusing on developing your technical skills through mastering basic techniques, learning effective takedowns, and practicing defensive moves and counterattacks, you can enhance your chances of winning freestyle wrestling matches. Remember, consistent practice and dedication are key to becoming a skilled freestyle wrestler.
Building Strength and Conditioning
Implementing a comprehensive strength training program
To excel in freestyle wrestling, it is crucial to have a solid foundation of strength. Implementing a comprehensive strength training program is essential for wrestlers looking to enhance their performance on the mat. This program should focus on targeting all major muscle groups to ensure overall strength and stability.
One effective strategy is to incorporate compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses into your training routine. These exercises engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously, allowing you to build functional strength and power. It is important to progressively increase the weight and intensity of these exercises over time to continue challenging your muscles and promoting growth.
Additionally, incorporating exercises that target specific wrestling movements can greatly improve your overall performance. For example, practicing explosive movements like Olympic lifts, plyometrics, and medicine ball throws can help develop the explosiveness needed for takedowns and escapes during matches. These exercises not only enhance your strength but also improve your agility and coordination, which are vital in freestyle wrestling.
Incorporating functional exercises to improve wrestling-specific movements
Freestyle wrestling requires a unique set of movements that demand functional strength and flexibility. To improve wrestling-specific movements, it is important to incorporate functional exercises into your training regimen.
Exercises such as Turkish get-ups, Bulgarian split squats, and single-leg deadlifts can help develop stability, balance, and flexibility in the muscles and joints used during wrestling maneuvers. These exercises mimic the demands placed on the body during matches, allowing you to adapt and perform more effectively on the mat.
Furthermore, incorporating core exercises like planks, Russian twists, and hanging leg raises can greatly enhance your overall stability and control. A strong core not only improves your balance and posture but also allows for more explosive movements during takedowns and reversals.
Focusing on cardiovascular endurance and agility through drills and conditioning
In addition to strength training, it is crucial for wrestlers to focus on cardiovascular endurance and agility. Freestyle wrestling involves constant movement and intense bursts of energy, making cardiovascular fitness a key component of success.
Incorporating high-intensity interval training (HIIT) into your conditioning routine can greatly improve your cardiovascular endurance. This involves alternating between short bursts of intense exercise and periods of rest or low-intensity activity. Examples of HIIT exercises for wrestlers include sprints, burpees, and mountain climbers. These exercises not only improve your cardiovascular fitness but also mimic the fast-paced nature of wrestling matches.
Agility drills are also essential for wrestlers looking to improve their quickness and reaction time. Incorporating ladder drills, cone drills, and agility ladder exercises into your training routine can enhance your footwork and movement efficiency, allowing you to quickly change directions and evade opponents’ attacks.
By focusing on building strength, incorporating functional exercises, and prioritizing cardiovascular endurance and agility, wrestlers can develop a well-rounded conditioning program that will significantly improve their performance in freestyle wrestling matches. Remember to consult with a qualified coach or trainer to tailor these strategies to your individual needs and goals.
Strategizing and Analyzing Opponents
Studying your opponents’ strengths and weaknesses
One of the most crucial aspects of winning freestyle wrestling matches is studying and analyzing your opponents’ strengths and weaknesses. By understanding their capabilities, you can develop effective strategies to counter their moves and gain an advantage during the match.
To study your opponents, it is essential to watch their previous matches and analyze their techniques. Observe their preferred moves, positions, and takedown attempts. Pay attention to their agility, speed, and overall wrestling style. By doing so, you can identify areas where they excel and areas where they may be vulnerable.
Additionally, studying your opponents’ weaknesses is equally important. Look for patterns in their matches where they may struggle or make mistakes. Identify any weaknesses in their defense, takedown defense, or specific techniques. By pinpointing these vulnerabilities, you can develop a game plan that exploits their weaknesses and maximizes your chances of success.
Developing a game plan based on your own strengths and their vulnerabilities
Once you have studied your opponents’ strengths and weaknesses, it is crucial to develop a game plan that capitalizes on your own strengths while targeting their vulnerabilities. Take into consideration your own wrestling style, techniques, and strengths when formulating your strategy.
If you possess excellent takedown skills, for example, focus on exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses in takedown defense. If you have superior agility or flexibility, consider using quick movements or escapes to your advantage. By leveraging your own strengths, you can put pressure on your opponent and dictate the pace of the match.
Simultaneously, tailor your game plan to exploit your opponent’s vulnerabilities. If they struggle with defending against certain grappling techniques, concentrate on executing those moves. If they tend to tire quickly, aim to maintain a high pace throughout the match to exhaust them. By targeting their weaknesses, you can create opportunities for scoring points and ultimately winning the match.
Adapting your strategy during the match based on your opponent’s actions
While having a well-thought-out game plan is essential, it is equally crucial to be adaptable and flexible during the match. As your opponent may also have their own strategy, it is essential to observe and analyze their actions to make real-time adjustments.
Pay attention to how your opponent reacts to your initial moves and adjust your strategy accordingly. If they have a strong defense against your preferred techniques, be prepared to switch to alternative moves or approaches. Observe any changes in their wrestling style, body language, or fatigue levels, as these can provide valuable insights into their mindset and potential weaknesses.
Being adaptable during the match allows you to stay one step ahead of your opponent and make strategic decisions that increase your chances of success. By analyzing their actions and adjusting your strategy accordingly, you can seize opportunities and outmaneuver your opponent to secure victory.
Remember, strategizing and analyzing your opponents is an ongoing process. Continuously stay updated on your opponents’ recent performances and adapt your strategy accordingly. By combining thorough analysis, a well-crafted game plan, and adaptability, you can increase your chances of winning freestyle wrestling matches.
Mental Preparation and Focus
Building mental toughness and resilience
Mental toughness and resilience play a crucial role in achieving success in freestyle wrestling matches. It is important to develop these qualities to withstand the physical and mental challenges that come with the sport. Here are some strategies to help build mental toughness and resilience:
Embrace adversity: Rather than shying away from challenges, embrace them as opportunities for growth. By facing and overcoming tough situations, you build mental strength and resilience.
Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals helps you stay motivated and focused. Break down your ultimate objective into smaller milestones and celebrate each achievement along the way. This will enhance your mental toughness and resilience, as you see progress and stay committed to your goals.
Maintain a positive mindset: Adopting a positive mindset is key to building mental toughness. Focus on the things you can control, such as your effort and attitude, and let go of factors beyond your control. This will help you stay resilient and maintain a strong mental state, even when faced with setbacks.
Practicing visualization and positive self-talk
Visualization and positive self-talk are powerful techniques for enhancing mental preparation and focus in freestyle wrestling matches. By incorporating these practices into your training routine, you can improve your performance and increase your chances of winning. Here’s how to effectively practice visualization and positive self-talk:
Visualize success: Before a match, close your eyes and vividly imagine yourself executing flawless techniques, dominating your opponent, and ultimately winning the match. Visualizing success enhances your mental preparation and boosts your confidence.
Use positive affirmations: Develop a set of positive affirmations that you can repeat to yourself before and during matches. These affirmations should focus on your strengths, skills, and abilities. By reinforcing positive thoughts, you can build mental resilience and maintain a strong focus on your performance.
Create mental rehearsal scenarios: Visualize different scenarios that may occur during a match, such as being behind in points or facing a challenging opponent. Practice mentally overcoming these obstacles and strategize how you will respond in each situation. This mental rehearsal will help you feel more prepared and confident when faced with real-life challenges.
Maintaining focus and concentration throughout the match
Maintaining focus and concentration throughout a freestyle wrestling match is crucial for staying in control and making quick, strategic decisions. Here are some strategies to help you stay focused and concentrated during the match:
Develop a pre-match routine: Establish a pre-match routine that includes mental preparation techniques such as deep breathing exercises or visualization. This routine will help you enter a focused state of mind and prepare you for the challenges ahead.
Control your breathing: Deep breathing exercises can help calm your mind and enhance your focus. Practice rhythmic breathing patterns, inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling slowly through your mouth. This will help regulate your heart rate and keep you centered during the match.
Stay present: Avoid getting caught up in past mistakes or worrying about future outcomes. Instead, focus on the present moment, paying attention to your opponent’s movements and reacting accordingly. By staying present, you can make quick, informed decisions and maintain a strong mental focus throughout the match.
Remember, mental preparation and focus are just as important as physical training in freestyle wrestling. By building mental toughness, practicing visualization and positive self-talk, and maintaining focus and concentration, you can maximize your chances of winning matches and achieving your goals.
Training and Conditioning
Implementing a structured training regimen
To excel in freestyle wrestling, it is crucial to have a well-structured training regimen in place. This regimen should focus on improving various aspects of your wrestling skills, including strength, endurance, technique, and mental toughness.
One effective strategy is to divide your training sessions into specific periods or cycles. This allows you to target different areas of improvement and prevent monotony. For example, you could dedicate one cycle to building strength and power through weightlifting exercises, while another cycle could focus on enhancing your agility and flexibility through dynamic drills.
Additionally, it is essential to establish a consistent training schedule and stick to it. Consistency is key in ensuring progress and avoiding burnout. Aim for a balance between intense workouts and sufficient rest and recovery periods to optimize your performance.
Working on improving speed, agility, and explosiveness
Speed, agility, and explosiveness are crucial attributes for success in freestyle wrestling. Incorporating specific exercises to enhance these qualities can significantly improve your overall performance.
To improve speed, incorporate sprint intervals into your training routine. Short, high-intensity bursts of running or wrestling-specific movements will develop your quickness and reaction time on the mat.
Agility drills are also essential for freestyle wrestling. Exercises such as ladder drills, cone drills, and lateral movements can enhance your footwork, coordination, and quick change of direction. These drills simulate the fast-paced nature of wrestling matches and improve your ability to evade opponents’ attacks.
Explosiveness is another vital aspect of freestyle wrestling. Plyometric exercises like box jumps, medicine ball throws, and explosive push-ups can help develop your power and explosiveness. These exercises train your muscles to generate maximum force in a short amount of time, enabling you to execute powerful takedowns and escapes.
Incorporating drills and simulated match scenarios into your training
In addition to physical conditioning, it is essential to incorporate drills and simulated match scenarios into your training. These practice sessions allow you to hone your techniques, improve your decision-making abilities, and develop your wrestling instincts.
Drills that focus on specific techniques, such as takedowns, escapes, and reversals, help refine your execution and timing. Repetition is key in mastering these techniques, so dedicate ample time to drill them with a partner or on a wrestling dummy.
Simulated match scenarios are valuable for replicating the intensity and unpredictability of actual wrestling matches. Spar with training partners of different skill levels, adopt different starting positions, and practice various strategies to enhance your adaptability and problem-solving skills. This type of training prepares you mentally and physically for the challenges you may face during a freestyle wrestling match.
In conclusion, a comprehensive training and conditioning program is vital for success in freestyle wrestling. By implementing a structured regimen, focusing on speed, agility, and explosiveness, and incorporating drills and simulated match scenarios, you can enhance your skills, improve your performance, and increase your chances of winning matches.
In conclusion, mastering the art of freestyle wrestling requires a combination of technical skills, physical strength, mental fortitude, and effective strategies. By focusing on proper technique, understanding the rules and scoring system, and implementing these proven strategies, wrestlers can greatly increase their chances of winning matches. It is important to constantly practice and improve upon these strategies, as well as staying up to date with the latest trends and techniques in the sport. With dedication, perseverance, and a strategic mindset, wrestlers can excel in freestyle wrestling and achieve their goals of victory in the wrestling arena.

To catch an Eagle, Part 3: Khabib Nurmagomedov’s tripod & ground control system
In the first part of this series, we focused on Khabib Nurmagomedov’s striking game that enables him to establish a grappling connection and take the fight to the ground. In the second part, we analyzed his pure takedown game and provided some examples of his submission grappling arsenal.
Our main objective in the first three parts of this analysis is to help readers prepare for the fourth and final part: How to beat Khabib.

Pt. 1: Conceptual framework
Khabib Nurmagomedov’s top game against the cage is based on dominating his opponents by putting them in
three positions: the referee’s position/turtle, the tripod and the sitting guard.
This game consists of Khabib applying top pressure by:
A. Using his weight by proper placement of hips/head and leaning forward.
B. Dragging opponents down, hanging on them with gut wrench or low deep waist control.
Here is Khabib, in his own words:
“My plan is to make him flat, make him tired and make him give up.”

It is important here to remember two key concepts/terms that were analyzed in the previous two parts of this series: “optionality” and “technical webs”.
Technical Webs
A technical web is a situation during the fight that is very difficult to escape from. It is different from a position in that a web can be a combination of positions. The BJJ mount combined with back control is such a technical web. When trying to escape from the mount, you can get your back taken and when you try to escape from back control you can end up in bottom mount position. When fighting a fighter with a well formulated game, you can get trapped in a never-ending loop, especially when strikes are involved.
Such technical webs are Khabib’s tripod and sitting guard domination games. All individual parts of Khabib’s game interconnect to formulate a complex system of action with enhanced optionality.
Optionality: Why options matter
Optionality: (finance, business) The value of additional optional investment opportunities available only after having made an initial investment. In other words, optionality is the sum value of all new options created by a decision. Likely, the biggest destroyer of optionality is exit potential.
Using the term loosely in MMA analysis, we can use a similar approach to identify the value of moves and strategies. If a move can produce a single outcome, it has no optionality. If it opens up a series of options, then the technique is useful in beating high level competition. Good opponents are not likely to get beat by a single technique, no matter how effective.
Khabib’s game is based on such optionalities. He invests on positions and controls that have all the options available for him and very limited options for his opponent. As you will see in the his top pressure game below, even if he ends up losing the position, Khabib will still be on his feet and in good shape. Gravity does all the work. Even if his opponent manages to escape, he will be exhausted. Khabib will try to take him down again and it will just be easier next time around.
The importance of the cage
Keep in mind that although there are many wrestling counters that can be used to escape the referee’s position or the tripod, most of them cannot be applied in MMA as the cage compromises a fighter’s mobility from the bottom. In other words, Khabib’s opponents are trapped between him and the cage. Another important point is that, in wrestling, the top wrestler cannot lock hands from the top referee’s position, so some escapes do not work on Khabib who is able to connect his hands continuously while applying his superior gripping game.
Fighting against gravity, removing posts and letting opponents build back up.
The problem for the bottom fighters is that they carry Khabib’s weight all the time. In reality, every attempt to stand up using their hands is like doing pushups with Khabib on their back. The Eagle uses leverage to keep his hands locked/connected and can stay there all day if need be. Each successful attempt by his opponents to post an arm ends with Khabib removing a post, breaking them down and forcing them to build back up. This is an exhausting experience.
You can watch below, how the top wrestler can apply pressure:
Using punches and knees to force opponents to remove posts from the ground.
There are two things fighters can do if they are trying to stand up from the turtle or tripod positions: post their arms on the floor or defend strikes. They cannot do both. If Khabib’s opponents have a good base, thus not allowing him to move them, Nurmagomedov punches them. Their head is defenseless because their arms are used for posting and they get hit with punches that they don’t see coming. Opponents are forced to defend and this compromises their base. As a result, Khabib puts them back down.

8. Repeat all above, transitioning from one position to the other in a never ending loop until you get them to tap or make them lose a decision.
It’s now time to take a quick look at some options from all positions.
Pt. 4: Pushing opponents against the cage (side, tripod, referee position)
The cage is the final destination for most of Khabib’s takedown attempts. If the opponent is able to resist, Khabib will go to low singles as analyzed in the previous part or for low waist control as explained in the examples below.
Once Khabib gets the opponents against the cage, his main priority is to force them to put their hands or knee(s) on the floor. He can do so by controlling the hip with a single-hand low-waist control or by connecting his hands.
We will now provide several examples of Khabib fighting opponents with their sides against the cage. We must note that opponents turn to their sides in order to avoid takedowns.
Double leg takedowns
A double leg takedown is always available when an opponent is with his back, or in this case his side, against the cage and does not have underhooks. In order to counter this, Al Iaquinta in the photos below,
tries to go for a switch. Unfortunately for him, switches do not work on Khabib. Dustin Poirier also failed in his switch attempts several times. Khabib’s gripping game is just too strong. He doesn’t let go and his balance enables him to stay on top.
Lift single leg and sweep the other leg
When Khabib can’t finish the single, he just sweeps the other leg.
Back arch throw.
If his opponent tries to stand up, Khabib goes for a back arch throw. Nurmagomedov falls to his side when performing this throw, thus landing his opponent on his shoulder forcing him to turtle.

Inside hook takedown
Outside hook takedown
Using the knee to block his opponent’s shin and break his balance forward.
In photo 3 below, Khabib uses his knee to put pressure on his opponent’s shin, thus preventing him from adjusting his post. This breaks his balance.
Pulling opponents backwards to take the back
Alternately, Khabib uses his shin to block the opponent’s lower leg and drags him down. In this example, as Conor McGregor sits down, Khabib puts his hooks in:
Pulling opponents to the side
Another option is to unbalance his opponents by pulling them backwards and to the side, following a circular trajectory. He did this repeatedly against Dos Anjos:
Getting a single hook in
Khabib loves getting a leg ride/single hook in. From this position he will either get a tap or force opponents to sit down in order to avoid the choke.
Khabib was able to rear-naked-choke Kamal Shalorus and others from this position:
Getting both hooks in.
Top turtle ground and pound.
In the photo above Khabib transitions to a top turtle ride and unleashes a series of punches. If the opponent tries to go to side control, Nurmagomedov will often remove one hook as described above. This enables him to stay on top.
Pt 5. Attacking the sitting position
Leg triangle from top position
A great way for Nurmagomedov to control opponents is to trap their legs in a leg triangle. Opponents try to push his feet to free themselves and this leaves their face completely unprotected from strikes.
Head-on-chin push
Khabib loves pushing his forehead against his opponents jaw,. This exposes the head to strikes. In the photo above Khabib is about to start removing posts, either by pulling Barboza’s right arm or by lifting Edson’s right knee.
Grabbing the far arm post
Here Khabib grabs Barboza’s arm post while hooking Edson’s left leg and pressuring him against the cage. Nurmagomedov pulls the arm and his opponent is flat again
Leg triangle and far wrist control from the back
Notice how Khabib has a leg triangle control, grabs Barboza’s right elbow post with both his hands and flattens him again. He keeps Edson’s wrist trapped with his right hand from behind and starts delivering punishment. Khabib’s head is also applying pressure. Barboza cannot defend from such a compromised position.
Wrist grab from the front
In this sequence, Khabib controls Barboza’s right wrist with his right hand from the front while applying forehead pressure. This enables him to punch Edson with his free hand.
Hiding the head under the armpit
A great way to deliver punches that the opponents cannot see coming is to place your head under their armpit. This limits their defending hand’s range of motion making it very difficult for them to defend. In the photo above Khabib also has wrist control from the back, thus preventing Michael Johnson from building back up.
Body-lock trapping opponent’s arm
In this final example, Khabib is able to connect his hands, thus trapping Poirier’s arm and pushes him down.
Final words: “Let’s wrestle. Your wrestling is zero, your grappling is zero. I am going to maul you.” Here is Khabib explaining to Conor McGregor what will happen in their fight :
“Sixth of October. Let’s wrestle.”

Mastering the Art of Takedowns in Freestyle Wrestling: A Comprehensive Guide
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling. If you are passionate about this dynamic combat sport and want to enhance your skills in taking down opponents, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we will delve into the essential techniques, strategies, and training drills that will empower you to dominate your opponents on the wrestling mat. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your takedown abilities, this guide is designed to provide you with valuable insights and expert advice to take your freestyle wrestling game to the next level.
Understanding the Basics of Takedowns
Takedowns are a fundamental aspect of freestyle wrestling. They involve swiftly and strategically taking down your opponent to gain control or score points. Understanding the basics of takedowns is crucial for any wrestler looking to excel in this dynamic sport.
Different Types of Takedowns
Single Leg Takedown: This is one of the most common takedown techniques used in freestyle wrestling. It involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs and swiftly driving them off balance to bring them down to the mat.
Double Leg Takedown: Similar to the single leg takedown, the double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent’s legs and using your body weight to knock them off balance and bring them down.
High Crotch Takedown: This takedown technique requires you to shoot in towards your opponent’s legs, driving your shoulder into their midsection. From there, you can lift and maneuver them to the ground.
Fireman’s Carry: The fireman’s carry is a more advanced takedown that involves throwing your opponent over your shoulder while maintaining control of their upper body. It requires good timing and technique but can be highly effective when executed correctly.
Strategies for Setting up Takedowns
Establishing Control: Before attempting a takedown, it’s essential to establish control over your opponent. This can be achieved through hand fighting, maintaining good posture, and creating angles to disrupt their balance.
Creating Openings: Look for opportunities to create openings for takedowns by feinting or faking attacks. This can force your opponent to react, opening up opportunities for you to execute a takedown.
Using Combinations: Utilize combinations of attacks to keep your opponent guessing and off balance. By chaining together different takedown attempts, you can increase your chances of successfully executing a takedown.
Key Techniques for Executing Takedowns
Level Change: A crucial aspect of executing a successful takedown is the ability to change levels. This involves lowering your body position while maintaining good posture, making it harder for your opponent to defend against your takedown attempts.
Explosiveness and Speed: Takedowns require explosive and quick movements. By training your explosiveness and speed through drills and exercises, you can enhance your ability to execute takedowns effectively.
Maintaining Balance: It’s important to maintain your own balance throughout the takedown process. This allows you to stay in control and quickly transition to other techniques if necessary.
Finishing the Takedown: Once you have initiated a takedown, focus on finishing it strong. This involves driving through your opponent, using your entire body to maintain control, and securing a dominant position on the mat.
Mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling takes time, practice, and a deep understanding of the basics. By familiarizing yourself with different types of takedowns, employing effective strategies, and honing key techniques, you can elevate your takedown game and become a formidable force on the wrestling mat.
Developing Strength and Conditioning
In order to excel in freestyle wrestling and master the art of takedowns, it is crucial to focus on developing strength and conditioning. This aspect of training plays a vital role in enhancing performance on the mat. By incorporating specific exercises for building core strength, cardiovascular training for endurance, and emphasizing the importance of flexibility and agility, wrestlers can greatly improve their overall abilities.
Specific Exercises for Building Core Strength
Core strength is fundamental in freestyle wrestling as it provides stability and power for executing takedowns effectively. Incorporating specific exercises targeting the core muscles can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. Some effective exercises for building core strength include:
Plank: The plank is a simple yet highly effective exercise for strengthening the core. Start by assuming a push-up position and then lower your forearms to the ground. Hold this position while maintaining a straight line from your head to your feet. Aim to gradually increase the duration of the hold as your core strength improves.
Russian Twists: This exercise targets the oblique muscles, which are crucial for generating rotational power during takedowns. Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly, keeping your back straight. Hold a weight or medicine ball in front of your chest and twist your torso from side to side, touching the weight or ball to the ground on each side.
Leg Raises: Leg raises help strengthen the lower abdominal muscles, which are essential for explosive movements in wrestling. Lie on your back with your legs straight and your hands by your sides. Lift your legs off the ground while keeping them straight, and then slowly lower them back down without touching the ground. Repeat for multiple sets.
Cardiovascular Training for Endurance
Endurance is another crucial aspect of freestyle wrestling, as matches can be physically demanding and often require sustained effort. Incorporating cardiovascular training into your routine can greatly improve your endurance levels. Here are some effective cardiovascular exercises for wrestlers:
Running: Running is a great cardiovascular exercise that helps build endurance and stamina. Incorporate both steady-state running for longer durations and interval training to simulate the intensity of wrestling matches. Interval training involves alternating between high-intensity sprints and recovery periods.
Cycling: Cycling is a low-impact cardiovascular exercise that can be beneficial for wrestlers. Whether you prefer indoor cycling or hitting the roads, it provides an excellent way to improve your endurance. Vary the intensity of your rides by incorporating intervals or incorporating hill climbs to simulate the demands of wrestling.
Jumping Rope: Jumping rope is not only a great warm-up exercise but also an effective way to improve cardiovascular fitness. It is a high-intensity exercise that engages multiple muscle groups and helps improve coordination and footwork.
Importance of Flexibility and Agility
Flexibility and agility are key components of successful takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Being able to move swiftly and fluidly while maintaining balance is crucial for executing techniques effectively. Here are some important aspects to consider:
Dynamic Stretching: Incorporate dynamic stretching exercises into your warm-up routine before training or competing. Dynamic stretching involves continuous movement through a full range of motion and helps improve flexibility and joint mobility. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, and torso twists.
Plyometric Exercises: Plyometric exercises, such as box jumps or lateral bounds, help improve agility and explosive power. These exercises involve quick and powerful movements that enhance muscle elasticity and coordination.
Yoga or Pilates: Engaging in regular yoga or Pilates sessions can greatly improve flexibility, balance, and body control. These practices also promote core strength and stability, which are essential for executing takedowns with precision.
By incorporating these exercises and emphasizing the importance of strength and conditioning, core strength, cardiovascular training, flexibility, and agility, wrestlers can enhance their performance in freestyle wrestling and ultimately master the art of takedowns. Remember, consistent practice and dedication are key to achieving success in any sport.
Mastering the Mechanics of Takedowns
Proper Stance and Balance
In the world of freestyle wrestling, having a proper stance and balance is crucial to mastering the art of takedowns. Your stance determines your readiness and stability while engaging with your opponent. Here are some key points to remember:
Gripping and Controlling Techniques
Once you have established a solid stance, the gripping and controlling techniques play a vital role in executing successful takedowns. Here’s what you need to know:
Footwork and Timing
Apart from having a strong stance and effective gripping techniques, footwork and timing are essential components of mastering takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Consider the following factors:
By understanding and practicing the mechanics of takedowns, focusing on proper stance and balance, gripping and controlling techniques, as well as footwork and timing, you can elevate your freestyle wrestling skills to new heights. Mastering these fundamental aspects will greatly enhance your ability to execute effective takedowns and gain a competitive edge in the sport.
Countering and Defending Against Takedowns
Recognizing and Reacting to Opponent’s Attacks
In freestyle wrestling, the ability to recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks is crucial when countering and defending against takedowns. Being able to anticipate your opponent’s movements and understand their preferred techniques will give you a significant advantage in defending against their attacks.
To effectively recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks, it is essential to develop a keen sense of observation. Pay close attention to their footwork, body positioning, and any subtle cues that may indicate an impending takedown attempt. By studying your opponent’s patterns and tendencies, you can better prepare yourself to counter their attacks.
Quick reflexes and agility are key when reacting to your opponent’s attacks. As soon as you perceive an incoming takedown attempt, you must swiftly adjust your stance and position yourself to neutralize their attack. Maintaining a low center of gravity and keeping your balance will make it harder for your opponent to execute a successful takedown.
Effective Counter Techniques
Having a repertoire of effective counter techniques will greatly enhance your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are a few techniques that can be utilized to counter your opponent’s attacks:
Sprawl: The sprawl technique involves quickly extending your legs backward while dropping your hips to the mat. By doing so, you create a wider base and make it difficult for your opponent to secure a takedown.
Whizzer: The whizzer, also known as an overhook, is a defensive move where you use your arm to control your opponent’s attacking arm. This technique allows you to redirect their momentum and potentially gain an advantageous position.
Front Headlock: When your opponent attempts a takedown, you can react by securing a front headlock. This move involves wrapping your arms around your opponent’s head and controlling their upper body, preventing them from completing the takedown.
Granby Roll: The granby roll is an effective technique to counter a takedown and quickly regain control. It involves rolling away from your opponent’s attack while using your momentum to reverse the situation.
Defensive Strategies and Tactics
In addition to individual counter techniques, implementing defensive strategies and tactics can greatly improve your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are some defensive strategies to consider:
Maintain a Strong Base: By keeping a strong and balanced stance, you make it more challenging for your opponent to take you down. Focus on keeping your feet shoulder-width apart and distributing your weight evenly.
Hand Fighting: Engaging in hand fighting with your opponent can disrupt their attempts to initiate takedowns. By controlling their hands and wrists, you limit their ability to secure a successful takedown.
Circle and Angle: Instead of standing directly in front of your opponent, use circular footwork and angles to make it harder for them to shoot for a takedown. Constantly moving and changing angles forces your opponent to adjust and can create openings for counters.
Utilize Defensive Drills: Incorporate defensive drills into your training routine to improve your reflexes, timing, and defensive instincts. Practice scenarios where your opponent attempts takedowns, and focus on reacting quickly and effectively countering their attacks.
By recognizing and reacting to your opponent’s attacks, utilizing effective counter techniques, and implementing defensive strategies, you will enhance your ability to counter and defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Constant practice and refinement of these skills will lead to mastery and success on the wrestling mat.
Strategies for Competition
Creating an Effective Game Plan
Having a well-defined game plan is crucial in freestyle wrestling competitions. It allows wrestlers to approach matches with a strategic mindset, maximizing their chances of success. Here are some key steps to creating an effective game plan:
Study your opponent: Before the match, research and analyze your opponent’s previous performances. Look for patterns, strengths, and weaknesses that can be exploited during the bout. This information will help you develop a targeted strategy.
Identify your strengths: Assess your own wrestling style and identify your strongest techniques and moves. Build your game plan around these strengths to capitalize on your skills during the match.
Set specific objectives: Determine specific goals and objectives for the match. These could include scoring a certain number of takedowns, avoiding specific moves from your opponent, or dominating a particular position. Having clear objectives will keep you focused and motivated during the competition.
Practice your strategy: Once you have identified your game plan, practice it extensively during training sessions. Work on executing your chosen techniques and movements flawlessly to build muscle memory and confidence.
Analyzing and Exploiting Opponent’s Weaknesses
One of the most effective strategies in freestyle wrestling is identifying and exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses. By studying their previous matches and observing their style, you can develop a game plan that targets their vulnerabilities. Here’s how to go about it:
Watch their matches: Analyze your opponent’s previous matches to identify any recurring weaknesses or areas where they struggle. Pay attention to their reactions in different situations and take note of any recurring mistakes they make.
Identify common weaknesses: Once you have observed your opponent’s matches, look for common weaknesses that can be exploited. These could be technical flaws, predictable reactions, or vulnerabilities in certain positions. Understanding these weaknesses will help you plan your attacks accordingly.
Develop counter strategies: Based on the weaknesses you have identified, develop specific counter strategies. Practice techniques and moves that directly exploit your opponent’s vulnerabilities, allowing you to gain an advantage during the match.
Stay adaptable: While it is important to exploit your opponent’s weaknesses, it is equally crucial to adapt your strategy during the match. If your initial plan doesn’t yield the desired results, be prepared to make quick adjustments and capitalize on any new openings that arise.
Mental Preparation for Matches
Mental preparation plays a vital role in freestyle wrestling competitions. It helps wrestlers stay focused, confident, and resilient throughout the match. Here are some key aspects of mental preparation that can enhance your performance:
Visualization techniques: Before the match, spend time visualizing yourself executing your game plan flawlessly. Imagine each move, takedown, and counter in vivid detail. This mental rehearsal helps build confidence and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenges.
Positive self-talk: Replace negative thoughts and self-doubt with positive affirmations. Remind yourself of your strengths, skills, and previous successes. Repeat empowering phrases to boost your confidence and maintain a positive mindset.
Controlled breathing: Deep, controlled breathing techniques can help calm your nerves and reduce anxiety before and during the match. Practice rhythmic breathing exercises to center yourself and stay focused on the present moment.
Develop a pre-match routine: Establish a consistent pre-match routine that helps you get in the right mindset. This routine could include warm-up exercises, visualization sessions, or listening to motivational music. Having a routine creates a sense of familiarity and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenge.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of physical prowess and mental acuity. By strategizing effectively, exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses, and mentally preparing for matches, you can significantly enhance your performance on the mat.
Drills and Training Exercises
Partner Drills for Takedown Practice
One of the most effective ways to improve your takedown skills in freestyle wrestling is through partner drills. These drills allow you to practice your techniques in a controlled setting with a training partner. Here are some partner drills that can help you master the art of takedowns:
Double Leg Takedown Drill: Start by facing your partner in a wrestling stance. Initiate the drill by shooting in for a double leg takedown. Your partner should sprawl and defend while you focus on driving through and completing the takedown. Repeat this drill multiple times, alternating roles with your partner.
Single Leg Takedown Drill: Similar to the double leg takedown drill, this drill focuses on executing a single leg takedown. Begin by gripping your partner’s collar tie or wrist control, then quickly transition to a single leg attack. Your partner should defend by sprawling and countering. Practice this drill with both partners taking turns as the attacker and defender.
Hand Fighting Drill: Hand fighting is crucial for setting up takedowns and gaining control over your opponent. In this drill, focus on developing your hand fighting skills by engaging in controlled sparring with your partner. Work on establishing dominant grips, clearing ties, and creating openings for takedowns. Remember to maintain proper technique and intensity throughout the drill.
Solo Drills for Technique Refinement
In addition to partner drills, solo drills are essential for refining your takedown techniques and improving your overall performance in freestyle wrestling. These drills allow you to focus on specific movements and body mechanics without the need for a training partner. Here are some solo drills that can help you enhance your takedown skills:
Shadow Wrestling: Shadow wrestling involves simulating takedowns and defensive movements without a partner. Stand in front of a mirror or an imaginary opponent and practice your takedown techniques. Focus on proper footwork, hip movement, and penetration steps. Visualize your opponent’s reactions and work on your timing and precision.
Shot Drills: Shot drills are designed to improve your speed, explosiveness, and precision when shooting for takedowns. Set up a series of cones or markers on the ground, and practice shooting from various distances. Start slowly, focusing on proper form, and gradually increase your speed and intensity. Challenge yourself by incorporating level changes and fakes into your shots.
Resistance Band Drills: Resistance bands can be a valuable tool for developing strength and power in your takedown movements. Attach a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point and work on your takedown motions against the resistance. This will help you build explosive power and improve your ability to finish takedowns against tough opponents.
Live Wrestling and Scrimmage Sessions
While drills and solo exercises are essential for skill development, nothing can replicate the intensity and unpredictability of live wrestling. Engaging in live wrestling sessions and scrimmages is crucial for applying your techniques in real-time situations. Here are some tips for making the most of live wrestling sessions:
Focus on Applying Techniques: Use live wrestling sessions as an opportunity to practice the takedowns you’ve been drilling. Focus on executing your techniques against resisting opponents and adapting to their reactions. Pay attention to your positioning, timing, and setups during live situations.
Experiment and Learn: Live wrestling sessions provide a platform for experimentation and learning. Don’t be afraid to try new techniques or variations of existing ones. Take risks, analyze the outcomes, and learn from both successful and unsuccessful attempts. This will help you expand your arsenal of takedowns and develop a well-rounded skillset.
Seek Feedback and Spar with Different Partners: During live wrestling sessions, actively seek feedback from coaches, teammates, or more experienced wrestlers. They can provide valuable insights into your takedown techniques, positioning, and overall performance. Additionally, try to wrestle with a variety of partners to expose yourself to different styles and challenges.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires consistent practice, dedication, and a willingness to learn from both successes and failures. By incorporating partner drills, solo exercises, and live wrestling sessions into your training routine, you can significantly improve your takedown skills and become a formidable competitor in the sport.
In conclusion, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of technique, strength, and strategy. It is essential to understand the fundamentals of positioning, footwork, and timing to successfully execute takedowns. Additionally, building strength and endurance through regular training and conditioning is crucial for maintaining control and overpowering opponents. Moreover, having a strategic approach, such as setting up takedowns with feints or capitalizing on an opponent’s weaknesses, can greatly increase the chances of success. By continuously honing these skills and incorporating them into one’s training regimen, wrestlers can elevate their performance and become formidable competitors in the sport of freestyle wrestling.

Understanding the Ring and Its Components
Before diving into wrestling techniques, it's important to understand the ring and its components. The ring is a circular mat that measures 32 feet in diameter and is surrounded by a circle of foam padding. The center of the ring is marked by a small circle, which is used to start the match.
The mat itself is made of durable material that provides traction for wrestlers while also providing a soft landing surface. The foam padding that surrounds the ring is designed to protect wrestlers from injury if they are thrown out of the ring. It's important to note that the foam padding is not considered part of the ring, so wrestlers must stay within the boundaries of the mat in order to avoid being disqualified.
In addition to the ring and its components, there are several other key elements to wrestling, including rules and regulations, scoring, and weight classes. Understanding these elements is crucial for success in wrestling, regardless of your skill level.
Basic Wrestling Techniques - Stance and Footwork
The foundation of wrestling is proper stance and footwork. A good stance is essential for balance and control, while proper footwork is crucial for movement and agility. Here's a breakdown of the basic wrestling stance and footwork:
Stance: The basic wrestling stance involves standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and weight evenly distributed between both feet. Your head should be up, your back straight, and your hands should be held in front of you, ready to grapple.
Footwork: In wrestling, footwork is used to create angles and set up takedowns. The most common footwork techniques include the slide step, the crossover step, and the pivot step. The slide step involves stepping forward with one foot and then sliding the other foot forward to maintain your stance. The crossover step involves crossing one foot over the other and then stepping forward to create an angle. Finally, the pivot step involves pivoting on one foot to create an angle and then stepping forward with the other foot.
By mastering these basic techniques, you'll be well on your way to becoming a skilled wrestler.
Takedowns - Single Leg, Double Leg, High Crotch, and More
Takedowns are a key component of wrestling and involve taking your opponent down to the mat while maintaining control. There are several types of takedowns, including the single leg, double leg, and high crotch, among others. Here's a breakdown of each takedown:
Single Leg: The single leg takedown involves grabbing one of your opponent's legs and lifting it off the mat, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with one foot and reach down to grab your opponent's leg just above the ankle. Pull their leg towards you while pushing them off balance with your other hand, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.
Double Leg: The double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent's legs and lifting them off the mat, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with both feet and reach down to grab both of your opponent's legs just above the ankles. Pull their legs towards you while pushing them off balance with your hands, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.
High Crotch: The high crotch takedown involves grabbing your opponent's leg and lifting it up to your side, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with one foot and reach down to grab your opponent's leg just above the knee. Lift their leg up to your side, while at the same time pushing them off balance with your other hand, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.

To execute this combination, reach across your opponent's body and grab their opposite wrist while at the same time grabbing their opposite knee. Then, pull both towards you to lock their head and leg together.
Half-Nelson: The half-nelson is a pinning combination that involves using your arm to lock your opponent's arm and neck. To execute this combination, reach across your opponent's body and grab their opposite wrist while at the same time using your other arm to wrap around their neck. Then, pull their wrist towards you while pushing their head away to lock their arm and neck together.
Tilt: The tilt is a pinning combination that involves turning your opponent onto their back while maintaining control.

Throws: Throws involve using your opponent's momentum against them to take them down. There are several types of throws, including the arm drag, fireman's carry, and hip toss, among others. To execute a throw, use your opponent's momentum to shift their weight and then use your own strength to take them down.
Suplexes: Suplexes involve lifting your opponent off the mat and throwing them down with force. There are several types of suplexes, including the belly-to-belly, belly-to-back, and German suplex, among others.

These techniques are more effective when you catch your opponent with both legs close to each other, allowing you to wrap and lock your arms around them. Shooting in is the building block for many wrestling takedowns, including double-leg techniques.","10 Wrestling Moves And Techniques You Should Master
Wrestling is one of the most popular martial arts worldwide, and it’s been around as far back as 3000 BC. It’s a grappling-based martial art that focuses on putting your opponent on the ground, controlling their body, and pinning them.
Wrestling is also an effective martial art for self-defense, and many view it as one of the best bases for mixed martial arts – the most permissive combat sport in the world that allows many of the techniques you might have to deal with in self-defense situations.
There are countless techniques used in wrestling, with some being more effective than others. This article will examine some of the most effective wrestling moves and techniques you should master. Many of these techniques carry over to other grappling-based martial arts like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and Judo.
Ten Wrestling Moves You Should Master
Ready to improve your wrestling skills? Let’s dive right into our list of techniques you should master:
1) The Penetration Step
The penetration step is the foundation for many takedowns used in wrestling like the single and double leg takedown. The technique is performed to put you in a position to grab onto your opponent and take them to the canvas.
Any competent wrestling school gets their students to drill this technique regularly unless the rules of the specific wrestling style forbid takedowns that target the leg, as is the case with Greco-Roman wrestling.
Practice the penetration step often until it becomes part of your muscle memory so you can execute the technique smoothly and quickly. The technique starts in your stance with your lead leg slightly in front of your rear foot and your torso a little bit bent at your hips.
Here’s how to perform the penetration step:
2) The Single-Leg Takedown
The single-leg takedown is one of the most commonly used techniques in wrestling, and that’s because it’s highly effective. There are several variations of the single-leg takedown, but they all involve targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and dragging them to the ground. There’s also the high crotch – commonly known as the hi-C single-leg technique that involves targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and using the hold to pick them off the ground and throw them to the floor.
The high single-leg takedown is the easiest type of single-leg attack to learn since you don’t need to perform a penetration step before shooting in on your opponent’s leg
Here’s how to perform a conventional high single-leg takedown:
Here’s how to complete a conventional single-leg takedown
Figure out which single-leg attacks work best for you and incorporate them into your wrestling game. These techniques are highly effective in wrestling settings and other grappling arts like BJJ.
3) Double-Leg Takedown
Double-leg takedowns are another popular technique used in wrestling. It’s a more interesting technique than the single leg, as it involves rapidly changing levels and exploding forward into your opponent. There are many ways to set up double-leg takedowns, like head snaps, hand ties, and misdirection.
These techniques are more effective when you catch your opponent with both legs close to each other, allowing you to wrap and lock your arms around them.
Shooting in is the building block for many wrestling takedowns, including double-leg techniques. Drill it frequently when you train to make your takedowns more effective. The faster and smoother your penetration step is, the more likely you’ll be able to complete takedowns when you shoot for them.
Here’s how to perform a double-leg takedown:
4) Sprawl
Sprawling is one of the fundamental defensive techniques used in wrestling, and it’s effective at all levels. Takedowns like the single leg and double leg involve wrapping your legs around your opponent’s legs to complete, but sprawling moves your legs out of your opponent’s legs and forces them to carry your weight. Your hand, head, and hips are your first line of defense against takedowns and holds, but you can always sprawl when all that fails.
Here’s how to perform a proper sprawl:
5) Snap-Down
The snap-down is a simple technique that puts you in the top turtle position. The best time to go for it is when your opponent is hunched over as they try to defend against incoming attacks. At that point, there’s nothing to stop their forward posture from crashing.
It’s a popular technique with freestyle wrestlers. Grapplers from other grappling styles, like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, are equally fond of it.
Here are the mechanics of the snap-down:
Besides being a simple way to end up in the top turtle position, snap-downs also open up your takedowns since both techniques require your opponent to do opposing things to defend against them. Your opponent needs to move their legs away from you to defend against takedowns which opens them up to the snap-down. Conversely, your opponent must pull their torso backward to defend against the snap down, leaving them vulnerable to takedown attempts.
6) Whizzer
The whizzer is another effective defensive move that all wrestlers should master. When you’re not in a position to sprawl out of a takedown attempt, the whizzer is your next line of defense. The technique involves securing a deep overhook on your opponent’s nearest hand as they try to complete a takedown.
Securing a whizzer puts lots of pressure on your opponent’s shoulder, and that’s often enough to discourage them from completing takedowns. You can also use the whizzer to drive your opponent to the ground in a half-nelson by wrapping your free hand around their neck, or you can execute a hip toss.
7) Switch
The switch is one of the fundamental techniques used to reverse disadvantageous positions in wrestling. A completed switch puts you in a dominant position or gets you back to your feet. Unlike escapes which only earn you a point in a wrestling match, reversals like the switch get you two points.
Here’s how to perform the technique:
8) Sit-Out
The sit-out is another fundamental defensive technique you can use to escape from bottom positions. At times, you can also use the technique to drag your opponent to the bottom.
Here’s what the mechanics look like:
9) Front-Quarter Nelson
The front-quarter nelson is a handy wrestling technique that carries over into other grappling arts. It’s an effective way to transition to a dominant position after stuffing an opponent’s takedown attempt with a sprawl.
To perform a front-quarter nelson:
10)  Chicken Wing (Armbar)
The chicken wing is one of the most uncomfortable things you can do to your opponent from top position. It’s also one of the most reliable holds for wearing down opponents and pinning them. Also known as the armbar in wrestling, the chicken wing gives your multiple options once you’ve secured the hold.
Here’s what the technique looks like:

After the penetration step and positioning start coming together then we move on to working more ties. I would love to hear your opinion on what setups you ...,"How To Teach Takedown Setups
One of the most popular questions I get from coaches is…
“what setups to focus on first with wrestlers?”
I have to be honest, this changed over the years for me.  It’s no wonder coaches have questions about teaching the neutral position… it’s easily the toughest position to get wrestlers to master.
Top position is by far the easiest, the key there is to teach technique and then develop tenacity.  Bottom definitely has its set of difficulties, but is nowhere near as complex as neutral.
“Get them good at control ties”  and my logic would have been “they need to be able to get ahold of opponents in order to force their style and even the most non-athletic wrestler can use them.”
Although this may be true as wrestlers develop, gain experience and climb the ranks…
In the developmental stages I don’t believe it to be true and after years fiddling with different teaching methods, I undoubtedly had the most success with the method I’m about to cover.
First, I want to define the three categories of setups within the system I have developed.
I want to be clear here…  When I say open setup I don’t mean that their is no contact.  Wrestlers should learn to go in and out of ties and this process should be physical.  They should be moving their feet, faking ties and faking shots.
Watch this video for a more detailed breakdown on Open Setups:
Examples of loose control ties are; Inside Ties, Collar Ties, Elbow Control and more
Watch this video for a detailed breakdown on the Inside Tie
Tieups that are considered control ties are Underhooks, Front Headlocks and Russian 2-on-1’s.
Watch this video for a detailed breakdown on the Russian 2-on-1:
When working with developing wrestlers that are trying to master shots and finishes it is not necessary to over complicate the tieup/setup process.
With this in mind, I prefer to focus heavily on using open setups.  This allows wrestlers to focus on the actual shot and finishes combined with developing the habits of moving, faking shots, faking ties.  All along learning to stalk, close the gap safely and snap out of ties.
Not to say that loose control ties and control ties shouldn’t be introduced… Especially to individuals that may have special tactical needs. When making these decision, you should take into consideration their weight class, how old they are, and the experience level of the athletes they will be facing.
Techniques and strategies for clearing all tie ups should also be covered soon as well, especially if you are dealing with high school athletes, where they might be facing wrestlers that use a variety of tieups effectively.
In conclusion, I like to start out having developing wrestlers focus on executing shots and finishes from open ties.  Setting opponents up from the open is going to develop crucial movement skills and allow them to focus on the techniques and positions needed to lay the foundation of solid leg attacks.  After the penetration step and positioning start coming together then we move on to working more ties.
I would love to hear your opinion on what setups you think developing wrestlers need to focus on as well as any success or failure stories you might have.  Please post any feedback below.

Mastering the Single Leg Takedown in Freestyle Wrestling
Are you looking to enhance your skills in freestyle wrestling and dominate your opponents with ease? Look no further! In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the art of mastering the single leg takedown. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your technique, this article will provide you with valuable insights, tips, and step-by-step instructions to help you excel in this essential move. Get ready to take your freestyle wrestling prowess to new heights and leave your competitors in awe.
The Basics of the Single Leg Takedown
The single leg takedown is a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling that can provide a significant advantage over your opponent. It involves taking control of one of your opponent’s legs and bringing them down to the ground while maintaining control. Mastering this technique requires a combination of proper footwork, positioning, gripping techniques, and a well-executed level change and penetration step.
Footwork and Positioning
Having correct footwork and positioning is crucial for a successful single leg takedown. To begin, establish a solid wrestling stance with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. This stance allows for better balance and agility, enabling you to react quickly to your opponent’s movements.
When going for a single leg takedown, step forward with your lead leg towards your opponent’s lead leg. Your lead leg should be outside of your opponent’s lead leg, creating an angle that provides a better opportunity to attack. Maintain a low center of gravity, keeping your head up and eyes focused on your opponent’s upper body.
Gripping Techniques
Proper gripping techniques are essential for gaining control of your opponent’s leg during a single leg takedown. There are various gripping options, but two common techniques are the high crotch grip and the ankle pick grip.
The high crotch grip involves reaching your same-side arm across your opponent’s body and securing a hold on their upper thigh, just below their hip. This grip allows for better control and leverage when executing the takedown.
The ankle pick grip, on the other hand, involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle with your same-side hand. This grip is effective when your opponent’s leg is extended or when they resist the high crotch grip.
Experiment with different gripping techniques and find the one that works best for you based on your opponent’s positioning and reactions.
Level Change and Penetration Step
Executing a proper level change and penetration step is the key to successfully completing a single leg takedown. A level change involves dropping your level by bending your knees and lowering your hips closer to the ground. This motion helps you avoid your opponent’s attacks and allows for a smoother transition into the takedown.
After the level change, perform a penetration step by driving your lead leg forward and shooting it towards your opponent’s leg. Simultaneously, reach for your desired grip on their leg, either high crotch or ankle pick. The penetration step should be explosive and quick, catching your opponent off guard and making it harder for them to defend.
Remember to maintain a strong grip, keep your head up, and drive through your opponent’s leg as you finish the takedown. Proper execution of the level change and penetration step, combined with precise footwork and effective gripping techniques, will greatly increase your chances of mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Common Variations of the Single Leg Takedown
High Crotch
The high crotch is a powerful and effective variation of the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg with your head positioned on the outside of their body. By grabbing their leg with both hands, you can drive forward and lift their leg off the ground, taking them down to the mat. The high crotch is known for its versatility, as it can be executed from various positions and angles. It requires good timing, speed, and technique to successfully execute the high crotch and secure the takedown.
Ankle Pick
Another common variation of the single leg takedown is the ankle pick. As the name suggests, this technique involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle and pulling it towards you, destabilizing their balance and setting up the takedown. The ankle pick is often executed when your opponent is in a defensive stance or when they are attempting to sprawl to defend against a regular single leg takedown. By quickly snatching their ankle and driving forward, you can bring them down to the mat and gain control.
Knee Tap
The knee tap is a variation of the single leg takedown that focuses on targeting your opponent’s knee for a swift takedown. This technique involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg, much like a regular single leg takedown, but instead of grabbing their leg, you aim to tap or push their knee with your hand. By applying pressure on their knee and redirecting their momentum, you can force them off balance and bring them down to the mat. The knee tap is particularly effective against opponents who have a strong base and are difficult to lift off the ground.
These variations of the single leg takedown provide wrestlers with a range of options to take down their opponents in freestyle wrestling. Each technique has its own advantages and requires practice to master. By incorporating these variations into your arsenal, you can become a more well-rounded wrestler with multiple takedown options at your disposal.
Defending Against the Single Leg Takedown
Sprawling
Sprawling is a crucial defensive technique when countering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves using your hips and legs to create distance and prevent your opponent from getting a hold of your leg. To perform a sprawl effectively, follow these steps:
Remember, practicing sprawls regularly is essential to develop the speed, timing, and technique required to defend against the single leg takedown effectively.
Whizzer and Overhook
Another effective method to defend against the single leg takedown is by utilizing the whizzer and overhook techniques. These techniques are especially useful when your opponent manages to secure a grip on your leg. Here’s how to execute the whizzer and overhook:
By mastering the whizzer and overhook techniques, you can effectively neutralize your opponent’s single leg takedown attempts and gain an advantage in the match.
Front Headlock
The front headlock is another valuable defensive technique that can be utilized to counter the single leg takedown. This technique involves controlling your opponent’s head and arm to prevent them from successfully executing the takedown. Here’s how to perform a front headlock:
Practicing the front headlock technique will not only enhance your defense against the single leg takedown but also open up various offensive possibilities.
Remember, mastering these defensive techniques takes time, practice, and repetition. By focusing on your sprawl, whizzer and overhook, and front headlock skills, you will significantly improve your ability to defend against the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Drills to Improve Single Leg Takedown
Shadow Drilling
Shadow drilling is a fundamental training technique that helps wrestlers perfect their single leg takedown. By visualizing an opponent and performing the movements without actual resistance, wrestlers can focus on their form and technique. Here are some key drills to incorporate into your shadow drilling routine:
Stance and Motion: Start by assuming the proper wrestling stance, with your lead leg forward and your weight distributed evenly. Practice moving in and out of your stance, circling, and level changing. This drill helps develop agility and quick footwork, which are crucial for executing a successful single leg takedown.
Penetration Step: The penetration step is the initial move in a single leg takedown. Practice driving off your back leg, stepping forward with your lead leg, and shooting your arm deep between your opponent’s legs. Focus on explosive power and maintaining a low center of gravity throughout the movement.
Finish Position: Once you have secured your opponent’s leg, it’s important to practice the proper finish position. Work on driving through your opponent, lifting their leg, and keeping your head up. Pay attention to your hand placement and grip, as they significantly impact your control over your opponent.
Partner Drills
Partner drills provide a dynamic training experience that simulates real-life wrestling scenarios. These drills help develop timing, coordination, and the ability to react to an opponent’s movements. Incorporate the following partner drills into your training regimen to enhance your single leg takedown skills:
Leg Defense Drill: Have your partner stand in a defensive position while you attempt single leg takedowns. Your partner’s goal is to sprawl and defend against your takedown attempts. Focus on properly executing your takedown technique while your partner tries to counter and defend. This drill improves your ability to read and react to your opponent’s movements.
Resistance Drill: Start in a neutral position with your partner. Initiate a single leg takedown while your partner provides resistance, forcing you to exert more effort to complete the takedown. This drill helps build strength and endurance while maintaining proper technique under pressure.
Counter Drill: In this drill, your partner attempts a single leg takedown while you work on countering their move. Practice sprawling, sprawling and turning, or executing a defensive technique like a whizzer. This drill improves your defensive skills and teaches you how to disrupt your opponent’s takedown attempts.
Live Situational Sparring
Live situational sparring involves engaging in controlled wrestling scenarios with a partner. It allows wrestlers to apply their single leg takedown skills in a realistic, dynamic setting. Here are some situational sparring scenarios to incorporate into your training:
Starting from Neutral: Begin the sparring session from a neutral position, with both you and your partner on your feet. Focus on initiating single leg takedown attempts while your partner defends and counters. This scenario simulates the unpredictability of a real wrestling match and helps sharpen your takedown skills under live conditions.
Starting from a Specific Position: Start the sparring session from various positions, such as starting with one wrestler already in on a single leg. This situation allows you to practice defending against an opponent in a dominant position and finding opportunities to counter and execute your own takedown.
Live Wrestling with Specific Objectives: Set specific objectives for the sparring session, such as scoring points with a single leg takedown or successfully defending against your partner’s takedown attempts. This type of situational sparring helps wrestlers focus on particular aspects of their single leg takedown game and improve their overall strategy.
By incorporating these drills and sparring scenarios into your training routine, you can enhance your single leg takedown skills and become a more formidable wrestler in freestyle wrestling. Practice diligently, stay focused, and never stop refining your technique.
In conclusion, mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling is a crucial skill that can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. By understanding the proper technique, positioning, and timing, wrestlers can effectively take down their opponents and gain an advantage in matches. The single leg takedown offers a versatile and reliable option for both offensive and defensive strategies, making it a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling. With consistent practice and dedication, wrestlers can develop their skills and become proficient in executing this technique. So, whether you are a beginner or an experienced wrestler, mastering the single leg takedown is an essential step towards achieving success in freestyle wrestling.

If you’re trying to learn the single leg takedown but you’re not sure where to start, let me break it down for you and show you how you might approach learning the single leg.
The single leg takedown is a technique that involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs, usually with both hands and using your position to force them to the ground. It is useful against tall and heavy opponents, as well as opponents who have a strong sprawl or guard. For over a decade, it has been the first choice for grapplers and combat athletes who like to compete.
Here are some of the advantages of using the single leg takedown over other takedowns:
Variations and Setups of the Single Leg Takedown
There are different types of single leg takedowns that you can use depending on your preference and situation. The main single leg variation categories are high single, low single, and mid-level single. For each type, we will explain how to perform single leg takedown effective variations step by step.
For future reference, virtually nobody in wrestling says “mid-level singles”. They’ll typically just refer to the three main types as high singles, single legs, and low singles.
High Single
The high single is the most common and basic form of single leg takedown . It is very easy to teach to beginners and involves grabbing your opponent around their knee.
High singles are easiest to learn since you don’t need to get into the complexities of the penetration step (which is where most beginners make their mistakes).
This variation is great if your opponent stands up in a very high stance or if you don’t want to drop to your knees with a single leg (due to a knee injury, for example).
To perform a high single leg takedown, you need to do the following steps:
Mid-Level Single
The mid-level single is a hybrid between a high single and a low single. It involves grabbing your opponent’s shin or calf instead of their knees or ankles. It has more power than a low single but more speed than a high single. It is the best single leg takedown variation for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in particular..
To perform a mid-level single leg takedown, you need to do the following steps:
Low Single
The low single is another variation of single leg takedown that involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle or foot. It is more difficult to perform than a high single but it has more precision and less risk of getting sprawled on.
Low singles are generally the favorite for fast and technical wrestlers since the attack focuses on precision and leverage (though there are exceptions to every rule). Setups are somewhat limited because you’ll tend to shoot a low single from a slightly farther distance.
Done wrong, a failed low single also puts you in a bad position where you’re extended and your opponent can put their weight on top of you like a sprawl, so there is more room for error than the other two variations. The plus side is that with the additional technical mastery, it’s also potentially the least energy-consuming of the single legs, which is why it tends to be the energy-efficient attack of choice for quick and technical wrestlers that can pull it off.
To perform a low single leg takedown, you need to do the following steps:
Common Mistakes and Counters of the Single Leg Takedown
As with all takedown techniques, there are some common mistakes that people make when attempting or defending the single leg takedown. Here are some along with ways how to correct them:
Mistakes When Attacking
Mistakes When Defending
There are also some effective ways to counter or escape the single leg takedown if you find yourself in trouble. Some of them are:
For each counter or escape, you need to act quickly and decisively before they secure their position.
Drills and Tips to Improve Your Single Leg Takedown Game
Practice makes perfect, especially when it comes to grappling techniques like the single leg takedown. Here are some training exercises or drills that can help you practice and improve your skills:
Double-Leg Drill
The double-leg drill is a simple drill that involves shooting for a double-leg takedown on your partner but instead of finishing it, you switch to a single-leg takedown on either side. This drill will help you develop speed, timing, accuracy, and transitions for your single-leg takedowns.
To perform this drill, you need to do the following steps:
Shadow Wrestling Drill
The shadow wrestling drill is another simple drill that involves practicing different types of single leg takedowns without a partner. This drill will help you improve your footwork, balance, coordination, and muscle memory for your single-leg takedowns.
To perform this drill, you need to do the following steps:
Partner Resistance Drill (Scrimmage)
The partner resistance drill is a more advanced drill that involves practicing single leg takedowns with a partner who offers different levels of resistance. This drill will help you test your skills, adapt to different situations, and overcome challenges for your single-leg takedowns.
To perform this drill, you need to do the following steps:
Single Leg Takedown Mastery Tips:
In addition to these drills, here are some general tips or advice that can help you master the single leg takedown technique:
How Do I Work on my Single Leg?
Choose your leg attack variation, learn the key finishing positions in that variation, and then master the setups. This sequence is unorthodox but there is a reason for the madness.
At the beginner levels, you can get a lot of mileage out of a mediocre setup but your inability to finish will put you in all kinds of trouble. You may also develop bad positional habits down the road if you’re used to getting extended as well.
Of course, I don’t mean have zero knowledge of how to set up an attack. Learn the basics there, but sharpen them after you feel confident in your finishes. Wrestlers tend to hesitate for their attacks due to their inability to finish their takedowns, so we want to mitigate this as much as possible by focusing on finishes first.
The single leg takedown is one of the most popular takedowns in wrestling. When you are controlling one of your opponent’s legs, your ability to score a takedown is far greater than your opponent’s ability to score a takedown. You can also personalize a single leg based on your body type, which makes it even more favorable. There seems to be endless variations and nuances of single leg takedowns.
Conclusion
The single-leg takedown is one of the most effective and versatile techniques in grappling that can give you an edge over your opponents. Whether you are a BJJ, MMA, or a wrestler, mastering this technique will improve your game and confidence on the mat. So what are you waiting for?

Single-leg takedowns are techniques you can use while grappling your opponent to the ground. It is useful against tall and heavy opponents. Performing a high single-leg takedown is very easy to learn for beginners and involves grabbing your opponent around their knee. Mid-level and low takedowns are another variation you can try to get better precision and have more finishing options, but they may be more difficult to perform. By mastering both types of single-leg takedowns, you’ll be able to bring your opponent to the ground quickly and efficiently!
Steps
Completing a High Takedown
Tip: Ask someone of a similar skill level to slowly practice takedowns with you so you can improve your technique step by step.
Performing a Mid-Level or Low Takedown
Tip: You can also try lifting their heel up toward your shoulder to make them more off balance and limit their mobility. If you do this, maintain your grip on their ankle so they aren’t able to break free.

Learning to dominate positions is a big part of getting better in wrestling. When you and your opponent start a match, you are both in a stance and have no contact. Neither wrestler has an advantage or disadvantage from this position, but once the whistle blows, the goal is to use hand fighting and pummeling to end up in a position that gives you an advantage and puts your opponent at a disadvantage. One great position that gives you a lot of advantage is an underhook.
If you are not very familiar with what an underhook is, check out this video where MMA star Chael Sonnen goes over the basics of an underhook.
From an underhook, you can pretty much hit any type of offense like ankle picks, single legs, double legs, throws, inside trips, and front headlocks to name just a few. Because underhooks are so versatile and effective, they are very important for all wrestlers at all levels to practice. If you are new to wrestling and want to learn some good underhook takedowns or if you are a seasoned veteran and want to refresh your memory with some great attacks from an underhook, here are a couple videos for you to watch.
High Crotch
In the first video, two time All-American Dan Vallimont show a basic high crotch from an underhook. A couple things you should take notice to in the video, first, look at his head position, it is on the inside. You can hit a high crotch with your head on the outside position, but it is a lot more difficult. Another thing to pay attention to is his underhook is not too deep and when he has it, his elbow is pointed down to the ground. Also, be sure when you hit this, your lead leg is on the same side as the underhook. When Dan shoots the shot, he uses an outside step, not a center step. Lastly, watch how Dan pressures into his opponent, and when he feels pressure back, he throw the arm hard but does not over extend his arm. It is very important to keep the arm tight to your body, if not, your opponent will hook your arm and use it to defend your shot.
Ankle Pick
An ankle pick is a great takedown from an underhook. In this video, two time NCAA All-American Hunter Stieber breaks down how to hit an ankle pick from an underhook. A couple things to watch for in the video. First, he has inside head position and his lead leg is on the same side as the underhook. To hit the ankle pick, you need your opponent’s far leg to be their lead leg so you will probably need to move your opponent around, circling, pushing, pulling, and snapping them in order to get them in the correct position. You can even fake a single leg to the near leg and when they react, hit the ankle pick.

Another thing to watch is how he blocks the ankle and throws the shoulder forward as he drives through his opponent. Often times, guys will pull the ankle into themselves and leave the underhook in and this can give your opponent a whizzer to defend with. The way Stieber does this eliminates that possibility.
High Single Leg
In this video, two time NCAA national champion and Olympian Ben Askren shows a high single leg from an underhook. A couple key points to this attack. First, Ben has inside head position and wrist control and this is ideal, but you can actually hit this same shot if your opponent has inside head position and has control of your wrist. You will also notice he uses an inside step with his far leg and uses the non-underhook hand to secure the leg then drops down with his underhook hand to secure the leg and drive it up. Make sure you don’t leave the underhook in too long or it give your opponent an opportunity to defend it.
Knee Pick
A knee pick is another great option from an underhook and when you watch the video, you will see how this knee pick and the previous video on the high single leg go together because if you try to hit the high single leg and your opponent steps their foot back defending it, it puts you in the perfect position to hit this knee pick.
A couple important things to point out about this knee pick. First, whether it comes from faking a shot or from you circling your opponent, their far leg needs to be their lead leg and they need to have a lot of weight on it. Secondly, you have to have a good angle to hit this, if you are facing your opponent, this won’t work. Another thing to watch is how Askren blocks down at the knee and drives through his opponent and shoots the other arm up into the air. If you don’t shoot your arm up into the air, your opponent will whizzer down on your arm and defend the takedown. Also, this is a great move for bigger guys. It keeps them from getting stuck underneath their opponent’s heavy hips.
The absolute most dominant position you can have when you have an underhook is to have inside head position and have control of your opponent’s far wrist. In a real match, it rarely happens that you get all three and that is okay. If you have an underhook and inside head position, it is not a big deal if your opponent has your wrist, it really shouldn’t stop you from hitting your takedowns. In fact, you can still hit a lot of takedowns even if your opponent has inside head position and has control of your wrist. Be sure to mess around with these different scenarios in practice to get comfortable in them.

Watch this video for a detailed breakdown on the Russian 2-on-1: When working with developing wrestlers that are trying to master shots and finishes it is not necessary to over complicate the tieup/setup process.","How To Teach Takedown Setups
One of the most popular questions I get from coaches is…
“what setups to focus on first with wrestlers?”
I have to be honest, this changed over the years for me.  It’s no wonder coaches have questions about teaching the neutral position… it’s easily the toughest position to get wrestlers to master.
Top position is by far the easiest, the key there is to teach technique and then develop tenacity.  Bottom definitely has its set of difficulties, but is nowhere near as complex as neutral.
“Get them good at control ties”  and my logic would have been “they need to be able to get ahold of opponents in order to force their style and even the most non-athletic wrestler can use them.”
Although this may be true as wrestlers develop, gain experience and climb the ranks…
In the developmental stages I don’t believe it to be true and after years fiddling with different teaching methods, I undoubtedly had the most success with the method I’m about to cover.
First, I want to define the three categories of setups within the system I have developed.
I want to be clear here…  When I say open setup I don’t mean that their is no contact.  Wrestlers should learn to go in and out of ties and this process should be physical.  They should be moving their feet, faking ties and faking shots.
Watch this video for a more detailed breakdown on Open Setups:
Examples of loose control ties are; Inside Ties, Collar Ties, Elbow Control and more
Watch this video for a detailed breakdown on the Inside Tie
Tieups that are considered control ties are Underhooks, Front Headlocks and Russian 2-on-1’s.
Watch this video for a detailed breakdown on the Russian 2-on-1:
When working with developing wrestlers that are trying to master shots and finishes it is not necessary to over complicate the tieup/setup process.
With this in mind, I prefer to focus heavily on using open setups.  This allows wrestlers to focus on the actual shot and finishes combined with developing the habits of moving, faking shots, faking ties.  All along learning to stalk, close the gap safely and snap out of ties.
Not to say that loose control ties and control ties shouldn’t be introduced… Especially to individuals that may have special tactical needs. When making these decision, you should take into consideration their weight class, how old they are, and the experience level of the athletes they will be facing.
Techniques and strategies for clearing all tie ups should also be covered soon as well, especially if you are dealing with high school athletes, where they might be facing wrestlers that use a variety of tieups effectively.
In conclusion, I like to start out having developing wrestlers focus on executing shots and finishes from open ties.  Setting opponents up from the open is going to develop crucial movement skills and allow them to focus on the techniques and positions needed to lay the foundation of solid leg attacks.  After the penetration step and positioning start coming together then we move on to working more ties.
I would love to hear your opinion on what setups you think developing wrestlers need to focus on as well as any success or failure stories you might have.  Please post any feedback below.
Thanks-Coach Daryl Weber

Angles can make or break your wrestling career. Being able to get your opponent off-balance requires more than just a head-on approach. You’ve probably seen this in boxing, where the knockout punch doesn’t come from a straight right but rather a sneaky left hook that catches the opponent right on the temple. It’s because of angles that wrestling has evolved from a linear sport to a battle for lateral conquest.
One of the best ways to get an angle on your opponent is with the underhook. How you get into that position is largely dependent on your body frame versus your opponent’s stature, but there are still some common details that must be addressed. Here to analyze the underhook position is retired UFC and Bellator fighter Chael Sonnen, who gives his take on the series.
Underhook vs. Overhook
Before going over specific details with the underhook, one of the first things that needs to be addressed is positional dominance. More specifically, who has control with an underhook? Chael points this out at the beginning of the video where he has an underhook on his partner that responds with an overhook. In this scenario, his partner has positional control because Chael’s underhook is shallow and weak compared to the partner’s pinning overhook. To remedy this, Chael flares his elbow out and keeps his palm flat against his partner’s back, which makes their overhook weaker.

Front Headlock
While the double leg and single leg are readily available with the underhook, many times you can force an angle on your opponent by moving backwards. In this scenario, Chael has an underhook on his partner and takes a backstep with the leg opposite the underhook arm (his left and right respectively). Doing so forces your opponent to dip their head just enough for you to cover with a headlock. From here, you have many options, including a snap down and spinning to the tail, a chin-and-lace hip bump finish, or transitioning into a gator roll. If the opponent resists the headlock and postures up, that leaves them exposed for a clean shot.
Collar Tie to Knee Pick
You can force your way into an underhook by pummeling in and creating separation between your opponent’s arm and torso. Another option is to rely on separation that the opponent makes voluntarily. Chael’s partner initiates a collar tie on Chael’s right side. Chael bumps the collar tie out of the way using his opposite arm (in this case, his left arm) by pushing the elbow away. This creates enough space for him to lock in the underhook. Notice where Chael is positioned afterwards, specifically the angle he’s created. He has dominant head positioning by staying on the outside. As mentioned earlier, wrestling is a game of angles, and the angle Chael’s created leaves his opponent open for a knee pick. To finish the move, simply move towards the leg opposite the underhook side and catch it with the far side hand. This creates a push-pull motion by pulling the knee in and throwing the underhook out. Doing so at this angle limits your opponent’s ability to move and thus results in the takedown.
Knowing how to cut your opponent’s angles off is paramount in establishing your wrestling career. Moving forward and backward simply will not cut it in advanced competition, but using underhooks in the manner that Chael Sonnen shows above mitigate your opponent’s ability to move and make your takedowns easier to hit.

The arm drag takedown is one of the best and most basic in wrestling. Mastering this technique teaches wrestlers the fundamental skill of keeping their arms short, and shows them how to punish those who don’t! Key elements to the arm drag series are controlling wrists, establishing head position, and forcing your opponent to pressure into you. Once these elements are in place, you are in position to score a takedown with essentially no risk!
How do you do an arm drag?
Step 1 Footwork – Outside Step and Pivot
Your footwork will start by stepping toe to toe with your oppoonent, making sure not to get too overextended with your initial step. When hitting the drag, change directions quick, head stays on same plane and punch with your same side hip.
Step 2 Drag the wrist control side, pull them to the mat
At the same time as your footwork starts, grab right above tricep, then step and punch with same side hip. Think about pulling opponent to the mat and catch their far hip to secure them.
Step 3 All one motion!
Execute the arm drag in all one motion – footwork, punch with the hip, pull opponent to the mat and catch the far hip. He goes down, you stay on your feet. It’s very important to know that once you go for the drag, the opponent knows it’s coming so you have to hit it quick! A great way to set the arm drag up is with forward pressure.
In addition to being safe and easy, the arm drag promotes chain wrestling! An arm drag can he used to set up a lift and return, or even a leg attack such as a single leg. Drill this technique, and you’ll have a lot of easy takedowns falling in your lap! Yours in Wrestling -Coach Weber

This technique involves using your hands and arms to secure a hold on your opponent. Its name comes from the Greco-Roman wrestling style that is commonly seen in the Olympics.
How Do You Practice Hand Fighting?
Sparring With a Partner
The best way to practice hand fighting is through drilling and sparring with a partner. When drilling, focus on specific techniques such as grips and hand placement. Pay attention to the angle of your hands and make sure you are in the correct position for each technique.
When sparring, use the techniques you have learned and focus on applying them to your opponent. Hand-fighting drills and sparring can help you develop the necessary wrestling skills to effectively use hand-fighting in a match.
Practice on a Wrestling Dummy or Shadow Wrestling
If you don’t have a partner to practice with, you can also practice on a wrestling dummy or shadow wrestling. Shadow wrestling can help build muscle memory and teach you how to move your hands quickly and efficiently while hand fighting.
Join a Local Wrestling Club or Attend a Camp
Another way to practice is by joining a local wrestling club or attending a camp. These activities can give you the opportunity to learn from experienced wrestlers and coaches, as well as practice with other wrestlers.
Watch Videos of Wrestling Matches
Finally, watch videos of wrestling matches and take note of how the best wrestlers use hand fighting. By observing how others use hand fighting, you can pick up on new techniques and strategies that you can use in your own matches.
Practice is essential for mastering hand fighting, and the more you practice, the better you will become. With enough time and patience, hand fighting can be a valuable tool in any wrestler’s arsenal.
How Do You Play Hand Fighting?
Hand fighting can be played in a variety of ways. The most common way to play hand fighting is during live wrestling matches, where you use your hands to control your opponent’s posture and movements.
You can also play hand fighting as a drill, where you practice specific techniques and strategies with a partner. Finally, you can play hand fighting as a game, where two or more wrestlers compete to see who can control their opponent’s posture for the longest amount of time.
Wrestling Hand-fighting Drills
1. Grip Drills
Practice different types of grips to gain an advantage over your opponent. Work on hand placement and how to use your grip effectively. For example, practice grip switching, grabbing sleeves, and using your arms to control an opponent’s posture.
2. Hand Drills
Practice how to move your hands quickly and efficiently while maintaining a strong grip on your opponent’s arms or clothing. For example, practice how to use a frame position and move your hands rapidly.
3. Push and Pull Drills
Practice pushing and pulling your opponent to gain an advantage in the match. For example, practice using your hands to move your opponent’s weight around the mat and to set up offensive moves.
4. Sparring Drills
Practice hand fighting with your partner to develop the skills necessary to use it effectively in a match. For example, practice grip switching, hand placement, and push-pull drills while sparring.
5. Positioning Drills
Practice positioning your hands in the correct positions to maximize your control of your opponent’s body. For example, practice moving your hands in different angles and positions to control an opponent’s posture.
Wrestling Hand-fighting Tips
1. Keep Your Hands Active
Make sure to keep your hands active when you are hand-fighting with your opponent. This will help give you an advantage and make it harder for your opponent to break free.
2. Maintain a Strong Grip
Practice gripping your opponent’s clothing or arms with a strong, secure grip. This will help you control your opponent’s posture and movements.
3. Use Leverage
When hand fighting, use leverage to gain an advantage over your opponent. For example, use your body weight to push or pull your opponent off balance.
4. Keep Your Head Up
Make sure to keep your head up and maintain eye contact with your opponent when you are hand-fighting. This will help you stay aware of their movements and stay one step ahead of them.
5. Practice Often
The more you practice, the better you will become at hand fighting. Take time to drill and spar with a partner to develop the skills necessary to use it effectively in a match.
6. Strengthen Your Palms and Grip in the Gym
Make sure to strengthen your palms and grip in the gym so that you can maintain a strong grip when hand fighting. You can use exercises such as gripping heavy objects and pull-ups to help strengthen your grip. These exercises can be executed as a part of your wrestling home workouts as well.
7. Be Patient
Be patient when hand-fighting. It takes time to master the techniques, and it is important to take your time and practice until you have perfected them.
Conclusion
Hand fighting is an essential part of the arsenal of any wrestler. It involves using your hands to control your opponent’s posture and movements to gain an advantage in a match. Practice different types of drills and exercises to become proficient at them, and use the tips outlined above to help improve your hand-fighting skills. With enough practice, you can become a master at hand-fighting and use it to your advantage in any match. Good luck!

Tutorial Showing Some Tips To Breaking Grip From Stand Up Escape, Peel The Hands And Cut Away (Get Out) When Doing A Standup Escape From Bottom For Beginners. This Instructional Goes Over The Keys To The Move And Is A Step By Step Breakdown. Subscribe for more wrestling technique videos, many more coming soon!
This video is for folkstyle wrestling, more specifically referee’s position after you have done your stand up. Many people get to there feet, and work really hard to get there, only to get returned to the mat. Learn how to break the grip when you are in a mat return position with a few basic fundamentals.
One very common mistakes are peoples level or how high or low they are standing. Many people have their hips out too far, or have their weight going forward too much. You want to bend your knees, and almost be in your wrestling stance. This way, he can’t take you forward, but he also can’t take you backwards either.
Second mistake people make is they try to fight the grip in the middle. When fighting the grip, move it to one of your hips, this will give you the correct pressure to break his grip. Also, fight the grip with two hands on one. Don’t fight both of his hands. You are looking to get that 2 on 1 (your 2 hands on 1 of his) so you can clear out and cut away.
This video is good for people who are new to wrestling and looking for instruction, for people just beginning or learning wrestling, or for anyone who wants to improve their wrestling basics or fundamentals.

Wrestling is a physically demanding sport that requires a combination of strength, skill, and technique. One of the most important aspects of wrestling is mastering the art of tie-ups, which is the process of gaining control of your opponent's body while standing or on the mat. In this article, we will explore the key elements of wrestling tie-ups, including wrestling stance, wrestling moves from the bottom, wrestling positions, wrestling moves tilts, and the best wrestling finishers.
What this article covers:
Wrestling Stance
The wrestling stance is the foundation of all wrestling techniques. A good wrestling stance allows the wrestler to maintain balance and mobility while also being ready to attack or defend at a moment's notice. The basic wrestling stance involves standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, your knees slightly bent, and your weight evenly distributed on both feet. Your head should be up and your back straight, with your arms bent at the elbows and held out in front of you.

Wrestling Moves from the Bottom
When a wrestler finds themselves in the bottom position, it can be difficult to escape and regain control of the match. However, there are a variety of wrestling moves from the bottom that can help a wrestler get back on top. These include the stand-up, the sit-out, the switch, and the granby roll. Each of these moves requires quickness, agility, and proper technique to execute successfully.
Wrestling Positions
There are three main wrestling positions: neutral, top, and bottom. In the neutral position, both wrestlers are standing and facing each other, with neither wrestler having control over the other. In the top position, one wrestler is on top of the other, with the top wrestler having control and the ability to score points. In the bottom position, one wrestler is on the bottom and trying to escape or reverse the position to gain control.
Wrestling Moves Tilts
Tilting is a technique used in wrestling to gain control of your opponent while they are on their back. Tilts involve using leverage and pressure to force your opponent's shoulders down to the mat, scoring points for near-falls or pins. Some common tilting moves include the half-nelson, the cradle, and the crossface.
Best Wrestling Finishers
The best wrestling finishers are those that are effective, efficient, and executed with precision. Some of the most popular wrestling finishers include the double-leg takedown, the single-leg takedown, the high crotch, the fireman's carry, and the ankle pick. Each of these moves requires a combination of strength, speed, and technique to execute successfully.In conclusion, mastering the art of wrestling tie-ups is crucial for any wrestler who wants to excel in the sport. Whether you are just starting out or you are an experienced wrestler, focusing on your wrestling stance, learning effective moves from the bottom, understanding wrestling positions, mastering tilting techniques, and perfecting your finishers can help you gain an advantage over your opponents and achieve success on the mat.

Presenting...
Skill Development & Drills Pack
The Skill Development & Drills Pack features over 30 drills that can be used to develop technical skills to be effective in live matches.  This is a 3 DVD set.  The first DVD is all about the basics.  Use these drills to learn how to drill.  Most youth and high school wrestlers don’t understand the finer points to becoming a great driller.  The reps you gain during your drilling session are programming you for live competition.  If you are drilling with bad habits then you will wrestle with bad habits.
The second DVD is loaded with skill development drills.  These drills focus on specific positions that are often problem areas for youth and high school wrestlers.  The drills are designed to develop a flow between common skill sets that are need to win at all levels.  You will also have access to downloadable practice templates.  These routines are the exact skill sets that Coach Weber uses and have been developed over many years in the trenches.  Use the exact skill sets or modify with some the skills your wrestlers or team use.
The third DVD contains high intensity practice drills.  These drills will take your level of technical mastery to another level.  The practice drills will develop superb conditioning and develop the feel it takes to chain wrestle and score on the best competition.
What is all in this Skill Development & Drills Pack?
Skill Development Drills
5 Points Top Drill – Use this drill to develop a killer instinct on top.  Smothering the bottom wrestler by getting pinning combinations and flowing from one to the next will result in getting more pins and winning more close matches.
Angle & Down Blocking Drill – Develop the instincts and skills needed to find angles offensively and defensively.  This drill series will develop the positioning and motion needed to score points and defend against the best wrestlers.
Bottom Base Drills – This should be a daily drill.  Understanding what is important to maintaining a solid base and building a base is something that should be automatic.  Use this drill regularly and find your wrestlers not getting turned as much and getting out from the bottom much more effectively.
Bottom Chain Wrestling Drills – This is a great drill to use for conditioning as well as a feel for constant motion on the bottom.  It is common knowledge that when you stop moving on the bottom you are going to get in trouble.  Use this drill to teach wrestlers how to string multiple moves together until they get out.
Bottom Master Skill Set – Trying to master a million moves never works out.  Use this coaching method to make sure your team or wrestlers master what wins the big matches.  You can also use this tactic to prepare for a specific team or opponent.
Bull Dog Drill – Maybe the most important neutral drill we use.  Your wrestlers will know how to score and keep themselves out of trouble if they don’t finish their Single Legs right away.  They will finish more shots and take more shots because they will be confident in their ability to score when they get in on the leg.
Hand Fighting Drill – This drill is designed to develop the mentality that your wrestlers want to control the ties all the time, but if they don’t they will know how to clear their opponents tie and flow directly into their own offense.
Mid-Level Hi-C & Double Finishing Drill – Hips in and head up will become natural after executing this drill routinely.  If you are sick of watching your wrestlers get the corner cut on them or squashed every time they take a head to the outside shot then you need this drill.
Hi-Level Hi-C & Single Finishing Drill – Don’t get caught standing around when in on a good shot.  Use this drill to get your wrestlers moving their opponents and finishing their shots when they get to their feet.  Nothing is more frustrating than watching your wrestler get to the leg, they are on their feet but still don’t finish.  Nail this drill and that won’t happen any more.
Programming & Chain Wrestling Drills – A good wrestler is tricky on their feet.  When they start stringing techniques together and setting up their shots, then they will get the takedowns in the big matches.  This is a great drill to develop these skills.
Push – Hang – Circle – Pass Drill – Use this drill to teach your wrestlers to get physical and take their opponent out of position.  They will learn to use their feet and hands as well as how to effectively work the head with this drill.
Shot Defense Drill – This is one of the prettiest drills out there when done correctly, to me at least.  If you understand that solid shot defense is crucial to winning the big matches then you will love this drill.  This drill will give your wrestlers the proper instincts if an opponent does get past their head and hands and gets to their legs.
Stalking Drill – Learn to put the pressure on your opponent and work your scoring holds.  If they beat you to the punch and try to score first, you will have the natural reactions to beat them and score off their shot attempts at ease.  Get this drill down if you want to learn to break opponents.
Tie-up/Set-up Drill – Develop multiple ways to get to your favorite shots using this drill.  Put together skills sets that work for your team or wrestler and run them through this high paced drill.  You will see even your most one dimensional wrestlers start to open up more opponents.
Intense Practice Drills “Unleashed”
The BAD Drill – High paced practice drill focused around dominating from neutral.
The Demon Drill – Hands down, best drill to teach wrestlers how to attack. (Great for all sizes)
The Fury BAD Drill – Squash the “Scramblers” on every takedown by using this killer drill.
Down Block Drill – Smother opponents and build the “He shoots… I score” mentality
Re-shot & Quick Score Drills – Relentlessly pick your opponent apart and break their will with this drill.
Over Under Around Drill – This drill does a better job developing a wrestler into a chain wrestling machine than any other drill I have seen.
Sparring - Learn the tactic the Russians use to develop their wrestlers. Sparring is the closest thing to live you’ll get and it will probably get you more tired. Watch your wrestlers bring everything together and look better than ever before after utilizing this training tactic for just a short while.
Attack Style Drill Basics
How to Drill – A breakdown of how to drill properly.  How your drill partner should be reacting.  How to properly work into a drill.  Some golden rules of drilling that you must follow in order to for it to count.
Stance and Motion Drill – This is a great series to work regularly into warm ups and conditioning.  Program your wrestlers to stay low, penetrate properly, move their feet and hands along with other important skills in your stance.
Pressure Drill - This is the drill I use to teach wrestlers, of all skill levels, how to get ahold of their opponent and put serious pressure on them.  Stalking and smothering opponents will become natural for your team after using this drill regular.
Get on the Head –  Getting an entire team to start working the head will make them more physical and will instantly increase their ability to get more takedowns.  Use this drill to break it down for your team and start getting more Front Headlocks, Leg Attacks, Go Behinds and much more…
Hand Fighting 101 - Youth and high school wrestlers will understand what it means to Hand Fight after using this drill.  Watch your wrestlers start dominating the tie ups, developing better defense and scoring more points.
Working From the Open - Every team will always have some quick wrestlers that like to sting from the outside.  The best outside wrestlers know how to move in and out and still stay physical.  This drill will have even your finesse wrestlers banging on their opponents, keeping them off balance and getting to the legs that much easier.
Finding Angles Okay, now we are cooking! When your wrestlers start to  recognize the openings most people miss from angles, getting take downs will be like taking candy from a baby.
Score From Opponents Action - I Shoot… I Score, You Shoot… I Score… Do you know who coined this? If not, you might want to start doing your homework. Getting easy takedowns off your opponents shots is what we call FUN!
Chain Wrestling - When every team figures out how to do this, wrestling is the most popular sport on the planet! Master this drill/mentality and watch the jaws drop in the stands when your team wrestles.
Score From Opponents Ties - This is what the Big Timers do. Get takedowns when your opponent feels in control. When you start doing this you can feel their will leave the mat.
Top Drills - Learn to smell blood. Right after a takedown is the best time to start working for the pin. Develop a relentless style from the top & take your game where most people never go.
Bottom Drills - You ever break someone from the bottom? I have and I have seen other do it. That’s when you really know you own your opponent.

So guys, today we are going to do a little bit of investigating in one of the most basic, and utilized ties in all of grappling, the collar tie.  Whether you love it, hate it, or could care less about it, it is very prevalent, and you will have to learn how to address it. Hopefully after reading this piece, and watching some of the attached videos from some very talented individuals, you’ll have a better sense of what to do when it is being used against you, or maybe even develop your own schemes.
The Collar Tie Basics
Usually, a collar tie is led with one hand, and the initiating wrestler’s free hand can look to attack at his or her discretion.  The free hand can be used to attack the other wrestler’s hands, arms, upper torso/belly, or the legs in almost any style or variation.
The collar tie is one of the most diverse ties in wrestling, and used correctly, can be one of the most dangerous and extremely hard to cope with.  Looking back through the hard-nosed years of USA Wrestling in the 80’s and 90’s you will see the collar tie used quite often, however the sport has evolved to take newer approaches to controlling a standing opponent.  I personally believe that used correctly, the collar tie can still be just as useful today as it ever has been, but I do not coach it hardly ever, and I’ll tell you why.
Most wrestlers get in on a collar tie and it seems like they lose sight of their overall goal.  They get lazy, they just hang there and expect a move to jump out at them, when in all reality, all that you’re going to do is give your opponent a tremendous opportunity to pass your tie up and score.  The second big problem that you see is that it is still done incorrectly; I’ve seen it even at the collegiate level done wrong. Athletes tie up on the back of the neck, which offers no posture or head control what so ever and then they wonder why they’re getting ducked so easy.  Disclaimer, there are effective ways to tie up around the back of your opponents neck and open them up to score, but usually these attacks are more dynamic in movement, sequences like slide-bys, duck-unders and the like all come off that kind of tie. Usually, you’ll see said list of attacks utilized much more effectively off of an over tie as opposed to a collar tie.
Too many wrestlers have developed a collar tie strictly for the sake of stalling an opponent out, which is a great waste of potential.  Some wrestlers use a double collar tie, similar to what may resemble a Thai clinch, minus the locking of their hands, and drop their elbows into their opponent’s chest.  This is a great way to stop your opponent from penetrating your stance, and great offensively to misdirect your opponent to set up your own scoring sequence. However, much like the way of the regular collar tie, the double-handed tie has been utilized more-so to stall and keep an opponent from being active than it has for the initiating wrestler’s offense.  To go back to where I mentioned about the decades of more hard-nosed wrestling, here is an awesome clip of one of the best guys to do it, Cary Kolat. Coach Kolat is the head coach at Campbell University where he has led many successful men and women’s teams, and mentored many more.
Here, Coach Kolat shows us the importance of establishing your own collar tie.  There are also tidbits on how to clear your opponent’s collar tie, as well as some basic offensive setups to pull it all together.  The emphasis coach Kolat puts here is more on the effort spent in your stance, always circling to your opponent, and constantly looking to clear opposing ties.  Notice the way he pummels his opponents arm to the outside, gains control over the top of the head, then begins to circle in his stance making his opponent top heavy, and unstable.  These are the things you look for in an effective collar tie series.

Now, the next video below focuses solely on your counter to your opponent’s tie up.  We’ve seen one of the best to ever do the collar tie, now demonstrating how to counter it will be one of the best wrestlers in the world today, J’Den Cox, with our own Bernardo Faria.  J’den is a three time NCAA Champ, World Champ, and 2016 Olympic Silver Medalist, and is one of the best pummeling guys around.
J’den’s elbow and arm compression counter is very tight, very uncomfortable, and very effective.  Attacks from there can be catered to fit your style; however he does go into some pretty slick stuff toward the end, along with more basic stuff in the beginning.
The intention of this article was not to get you to love or hate the collar tie, but simply to get familiar with it, learn to counter it, and if it suits your game, be offensive from it.  Hopefully you found this piece informative, and it helped shed some light on some potential issues any of you readers may have.

Defend the Front Headlock Standing Position,Defensive strategies and techniques for countering a front headlock while standing.,How to defend against a front headlock in a standing position in wrestling?,,,,,Dominate Your Opponent With Front Headlocks - Fanatic Wrestling,https://fanaticwrestling.com/blogs/news/dominate-your-opponent-with-front-headlocks,"Watch on. With this front headlock, instead of closing it up by grabbing your hand, watch how Ruth shoots the arm really deep under the chin and arm then locks on to his own elbow. The other hand should go across your opponent's back. Be sure to keep a lot of pressure on the head and neck of your opponent.","Dominate Your Opponent With Front Headlocks
Developing a good offense is vital if you want to succeed in wrestling. Some of the first takedowns a wrestler usually learns are different types of shots like a single leg or a double leg and these are great options to get takedowns. Another great way to score takedowns is with front headlocks.
Front headlocks have some advantages over shots when it comes to scoring points. First of all, it is easier to stay out of messy scramble situations when you get a front headlock locked up when compared to shooting a shot. Also, there are many different options from a front headlock position to put your opponent right to their back. Lastly, when you have a guy in a front headlock, it really wears them out because the have to carry your weight on their arms.
Let’s look at some great finishes from a front headlock.
Throw By
The first finish is a simple throw by. and comes from blocking a shot. This finish can be hit from an open or closed front headlock.
When you hit a throw by, you need to keep a lot of pressure on your opponent’s head and neck. In addition to pressure, you need to keep your opponent moving. If you stop moving, it will allow them time to defend the front headlock. You will chase the far leg, which should be the only leg you can see and your opponent’s natural response will be to keep circling to try to face you. If they happen to not try to face you, then you will be able to just spin behind for the easy take down.
Once you get your opponent circling, throw the head and arm by hard, almost like you are trying to stir a big pot; then attacks the hips and earn your two points. This move is all about circling and snaps, the more you focus on those two things, the easier the throw by will be. Check out this video of Bekzod Abdurakhminov hitting his variation of it.

Head In The Hole
Another great option from a front headlock is to put your head in the hole which means to bury your head in their side and chase the far leg. To do this correctly, you are going to stay tight on the chin and bring your elbow to your side which bends your opponents neck laterally. Then drive your head deep into their rib cage (the hole) and attack either the leg at the knee or you can even reach up and grab their opposite hip.
If you attack the knee, you can even turn it into a near side cradle by driving into them until you can lock your hands together. If you want to get real fancy with a cradle from the head in the hole position, check out this roll through cradle by Hudson Taylor. If you are having trouble locking up a basic near side cradle, this is a great option to get the pin.
Cow Catcher
One move you can hit from an open front headlock is a cow catcher, sometimes also called a bulldog or a cement mixer. Now sometimes this move get criticized at a move that will not work against high level competition, but Iowa wrestlers hit this all the time in big matches.
It starts with an open front headlock. The arm that is on the elbow slides under the arm, like an underhook, and you sink it in deep. At the same time, you step up with the leg on that same side and with the other arm, clamp down on your opponent’s head. From here, drive into them, stay heavy on their head and put them to their back. You should end up with a really tight half which makes for an easy pin.
Head and Arm Roll
If you are looking for another finish from the front headlock position that puts your opponent straight to their back, check out this head and arm roll by Ed Ruth.
With this front headlock, instead of closing it up by grabbing your hand, watch how Ruth shoots the arm really deep under the chin and arm then locks on to his own elbow. The other hand should go across your opponent’s back. Be sure to keep a lot of pressure on the head and neck of your opponent. Ruth refers to this as sinking in to it. Then just run your feet to the outside to increase pressure and tuck you head under and roll. Then, step over and secure the pin.
If you want to really step up your offensive game, you need to start working front headlocks into your arsenal. There have been many high level wrestlers that have scored a lot of points from front headlocks.

The Front Headlock is a very dangerous position for the defensive guy, and an extremely controlling position for the guy on offense. Whenever your opponent is hanging his head down a little you can snap his head down. You can also get this if your opponent takes a bad shot and you sprawl good enough that he's not on your legs or barely has them. It's very easy to control your opponent with a Front Headlock and if used correctly you should be able to get a takedown.
You will pull his head underneath your chest. Grab the chin with your right hand while keeping your elbow high so it's harder for him to grab it. Your arm should be fairly shallow. You can even grip the neck, making your elbow even harder to reach. Your right shoulder should be digging into his trap muscle on the left side of his neck. With your left hand, you'll grab the opposite arm and lift it up. Keeping one of his arms elevated makes it so he can only use one to either support himself or defend his position. If you stuff his arm above his head it will warm his upper-body and make him especially uncomfortable. You can be over the arm or underneath it, but we recommend being over unless you're trying to get a Cement Job and other related moves.
Ideally, you'll want to snap him down to the mat and finish from there. You have more control on the mat than on your feet.
Front Headlock On Feet
You'll have the Front Headlock, but both you and your opponent will be standing on your feet. So this is before you snap him down to the mat. Usually you'll get here while hand-fighting or if he takes a bad shot but doesn't fully commit and you snap the head under your chest. You can control this by lifting the arm up with your arm on the outside, or by having your arm under his arm (Under-Hook, Cement Job). I recommend you try to keep your hand on the outside to lower the chances of him grabbing both elbows and forcing a stalemate.
Front Headlock Defense On Feet
Your head is stuck under his chest so he has a Front Headlock. The goal is to get out of this position as soon as possible before it gets any worse. You can shoot out of most tie-ups, but for this one I want you to get out of it first before you attack. These moves have that goal in mind. If you try to shoot under a Front Headlock there's a very good chance that an experienced wrestler will feel this start to happen and he'll sprawl on you, making the situation worse for yourself. Do not dig yourself a bigger hole. Do not get into a false sense of security thinking that moves that work against bad wrestlers will work against good wrestlers. Remember: your style should not change depending on who you're wrestling. You need to have consistent and good technique if you want to win consistently. Don't use bad technique just because you can. Develop good habits that you'll need to use against good wrestlers.
Front Headlock On The Mat
This would be when you have the Front Headlock but down on the mat. Your opponent will be on his hands and knees, you should be off of your knees to improve your mobility and to put more pressure or weight on your opponent. You can snap his head down repeatedly (bounce the head) to break him down and keep his weight on his hands, but don't do it too often or too aggressively or you'll end up giving up Unnecessary Roughness call.
Front Headlock Defense On The
When you're on the mat and stuck in a Front Headlock, you should probably grab an elbow and pull it down as soon as you can. This will secure your position a little bit and give you time to improve your situation. It'll also limit the amount of attacks the top wrestler can use and it will keep him in front of you. You can grab the chin hand with two hands and post it down, but it's a little bit more dangerous because the top guy has a lot more mobility in this situation compared to when you're on your feet. He can start to spin around you and with his weight on you it's harder to match his rotation. Grabbing the elbow solves this a little better.
Front Headlock Short Offense
To me this means you'll be keeping your arms short, hands over top of the head and/or shoulders. This way your opponent cannot grab your elbows and slow you down in this position. You'll have a lot more mobility, but you will have less control of your opponent. Make sure you keep your hips low, knees off the mat, feet wide and back. You don't want to run into a random shot, and you don't want to lose him completely.",0.90567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ben Askren, renowned for his exceptional wrestling skills, showcased not only an offensive arsenal but also a formidable defense that became a hallmark of his illustrious career. Among the many defensive maneuvers in his repertoire, Askren's proficiency in countering the single leg takedown stood out as a testament to his technical prowess and strategic acumen.
Sprawling with Precision
Askren's defensive strategy against the single leg often began with a lightning-fast sprawl. The moment an opponent initiated the single leg attempt, Askren seamlessly executed a sprawl—shooting his hips back and down while sprawling his legs backward. This rapid and precise movement widened his base, making it incredibly challenging for opponents to secure the takedown.
Utilizing the Whizzer
The Whizzer, a key component of Askren's defensive toolkit, involved overhooking the arm on the side the opponent was attacking. Applying downward pressure on the opponent's shoulder, Askren effectively thwarted their efforts to lift his leg and disrupt his balance. The Whizzer became a go-to move for Askren, turning what seemed like an imminent takedown into an opportunity for a counterattack.
Down Blocks with Finesse
Another facet of Askren's defensive brilliance was the down block. When opponents aimed to penetrate and secure the single leg, Askren responded with a well-timed down block. By using his lead hand to push down on the opponent's head while simultaneously stepping back with the lead leg, Askren disrupted their setup and denied them the position needed for a successful takedown.
Churella
Creating Scrambles
Askren's defensive approach extended beyond static techniques. He excelled in creating scrambles, turning the chaos of a single leg attempt into an advantageous position for himself. As opponents committed to the takedown, Askren's ability to fluidly transition and capitalize on openings showcased his wrestling IQ and adaptability.
Maintaining Impeccable Stance
Fundamental to Askren's defense was his commitment to maintaining a solid wrestling stance. By staying low and balanced, with weight evenly distributed on both legs, Askren made it challenging for opponents to initiate successful single leg attacks. His disciplined stance served as the foundation for his defensive wizardry.
Background Of Ben Askren

Mastering the Single Leg Takedown in Freestyle Wrestling
Are you looking to enhance your skills in freestyle wrestling and dominate your opponents with ease? Look no further! In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the art of mastering the single leg takedown. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your technique, this article will provide you with valuable insights, tips, and step-by-step instructions to help you excel in this essential move. Get ready to take your freestyle wrestling prowess to new heights and leave your competitors in awe.
The Basics of the Single Leg Takedown
The single leg takedown is a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling that can provide a significant advantage over your opponent. It involves taking control of one of your opponent’s legs and bringing them down to the ground while maintaining control. Mastering this technique requires a combination of proper footwork, positioning, gripping techniques, and a well-executed level change and penetration step.
Footwork and Positioning
Having correct footwork and positioning is crucial for a successful single leg takedown. To begin, establish a solid wrestling stance with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. This stance allows for better balance and agility, enabling you to react quickly to your opponent’s movements.
When going for a single leg takedown, step forward with your lead leg towards your opponent’s lead leg. Your lead leg should be outside of your opponent’s lead leg, creating an angle that provides a better opportunity to attack. Maintain a low center of gravity, keeping your head up and eyes focused on your opponent’s upper body.
Gripping Techniques
Proper gripping techniques are essential for gaining control of your opponent’s leg during a single leg takedown. There are various gripping options, but two common techniques are the high crotch grip and the ankle pick grip.
The high crotch grip involves reaching your same-side arm across your opponent’s body and securing a hold on their upper thigh, just below their hip. This grip allows for better control and leverage when executing the takedown.
The ankle pick grip, on the other hand, involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle with your same-side hand. This grip is effective when your opponent’s leg is extended or when they resist the high crotch grip.
Experiment with different gripping techniques and find the one that works best for you based on your opponent’s positioning and reactions.
Level Change and Penetration Step
Executing a proper level change and penetration step is the key to successfully completing a single leg takedown. A level change involves dropping your level by bending your knees and lowering your hips closer to the ground. This motion helps you avoid your opponent’s attacks and allows for a smoother transition into the takedown.
After the level change, perform a penetration step by driving your lead leg forward and shooting it towards your opponent’s leg. Simultaneously, reach for your desired grip on their leg, either high crotch or ankle pick. The penetration step should be explosive and quick, catching your opponent off guard and making it harder for them to defend.
Remember to maintain a strong grip, keep your head up, and drive through your opponent’s leg as you finish the takedown. Proper execution of the level change and penetration step, combined with precise footwork and effective gripping techniques, will greatly increase your chances of mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Common Variations of the Single Leg Takedown
High Crotch
The high crotch is a powerful and effective variation of the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg with your head positioned on the outside of their body. By grabbing their leg with both hands, you can drive forward and lift their leg off the ground, taking them down to the mat. The high crotch is known for its versatility, as it can be executed from various positions and angles. It requires good timing, speed, and technique to successfully execute the high crotch and secure the takedown.
Ankle Pick
Another common variation of the single leg takedown is the ankle pick. As the name suggests, this technique involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle and pulling it towards you, destabilizing their balance and setting up the takedown. The ankle pick is often executed when your opponent is in a defensive stance or when they are attempting to sprawl to defend against a regular single leg takedown. By quickly snatching their ankle and driving forward, you can bring them down to the mat and gain control.
Knee Tap
The knee tap is a variation of the single leg takedown that focuses on targeting your opponent’s knee for a swift takedown. This technique involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg, much like a regular single leg takedown, but instead of grabbing their leg, you aim to tap or push their knee with your hand. By applying pressure on their knee and redirecting their momentum, you can force them off balance and bring them down to the mat. The knee tap is particularly effective against opponents who have a strong base and are difficult to lift off the ground.
These variations of the single leg takedown provide wrestlers with a range of options to take down their opponents in freestyle wrestling. Each technique has its own advantages and requires practice to master. By incorporating these variations into your arsenal, you can become a more well-rounded wrestler with multiple takedown options at your disposal.
Defending Against the Single Leg Takedown
Sprawling
Sprawling is a crucial defensive technique when countering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves using your hips and legs to create distance and prevent your opponent from getting a hold of your leg. To perform a sprawl effectively, follow these steps:
Remember, practicing sprawls regularly is essential to develop the speed, timing, and technique required to defend against the single leg takedown effectively.
Whizzer and Overhook
Another effective method to defend against the single leg takedown is by utilizing the whizzer and overhook techniques. These techniques are especially useful when your opponent manages to secure a grip on your leg. Here’s how to execute the whizzer and overhook:
By mastering the whizzer and overhook techniques, you can effectively neutralize your opponent’s single leg takedown attempts and gain an advantage in the match.
Front Headlock
The front headlock is another valuable defensive technique that can be utilized to counter the single leg takedown. This technique involves controlling your opponent’s head and arm to prevent them from successfully executing the takedown. Here’s how to perform a front headlock:
Practicing the front headlock technique will not only enhance your defense against the single leg takedown but also open up various offensive possibilities.
Remember, mastering these defensive techniques takes time, practice, and repetition. By focusing on your sprawl, whizzer and overhook, and front headlock skills, you will significantly improve your ability to defend against the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Drills to Improve Single Leg Takedown
Shadow Drilling
Shadow drilling is a fundamental training technique that helps wrestlers perfect their single leg takedown. By visualizing an opponent and performing the movements without actual resistance, wrestlers can focus on their form and technique. Here are some key drills to incorporate into your shadow drilling routine:
Stance and Motion: Start by assuming the proper wrestling stance, with your lead leg forward and your weight distributed evenly. Practice moving in and out of your stance, circling, and level changing. This drill helps develop agility and quick footwork, which are crucial for executing a successful single leg takedown.
Penetration Step: The penetration step is the initial move in a single leg takedown. Practice driving off your back leg, stepping forward with your lead leg, and shooting your arm deep between your opponent’s legs. Focus on explosive power and maintaining a low center of gravity throughout the movement.
Finish Position: Once you have secured your opponent’s leg, it’s important to practice the proper finish position. Work on driving through your opponent, lifting their leg, and keeping your head up. Pay attention to your hand placement and grip, as they significantly impact your control over your opponent.
Partner Drills
Partner drills provide a dynamic training experience that simulates real-life wrestling scenarios. These drills help develop timing, coordination, and the ability to react to an opponent’s movements. Incorporate the following partner drills into your training regimen to enhance your single leg takedown skills:
Leg Defense Drill: Have your partner stand in a defensive position while you attempt single leg takedowns. Your partner’s goal is to sprawl and defend against your takedown attempts. Focus on properly executing your takedown technique while your partner tries to counter and defend. This drill improves your ability to read and react to your opponent’s movements.
Resistance Drill: Start in a neutral position with your partner. Initiate a single leg takedown while your partner provides resistance, forcing you to exert more effort to complete the takedown. This drill helps build strength and endurance while maintaining proper technique under pressure.
Counter Drill: In this drill, your partner attempts a single leg takedown while you work on countering their move. Practice sprawling, sprawling and turning, or executing a defensive technique like a whizzer. This drill improves your defensive skills and teaches you how to disrupt your opponent’s takedown attempts.
Live Situational Sparring
Live situational sparring involves engaging in controlled wrestling scenarios with a partner. It allows wrestlers to apply their single leg takedown skills in a realistic, dynamic setting. Here are some situational sparring scenarios to incorporate into your training:
Starting from Neutral: Begin the sparring session from a neutral position, with both you and your partner on your feet. Focus on initiating single leg takedown attempts while your partner defends and counters. This scenario simulates the unpredictability of a real wrestling match and helps sharpen your takedown skills under live conditions.
Starting from a Specific Position: Start the sparring session from various positions, such as starting with one wrestler already in on a single leg. This situation allows you to practice defending against an opponent in a dominant position and finding opportunities to counter and execute your own takedown.
Live Wrestling with Specific Objectives: Set specific objectives for the sparring session, such as scoring points with a single leg takedown or successfully defending against your partner’s takedown attempts. This type of situational sparring helps wrestlers focus on particular aspects of their single leg takedown game and improve their overall strategy.
By incorporating these drills and sparring scenarios into your training routine, you can enhance your single leg takedown skills and become a more formidable wrestler in freestyle wrestling. Practice diligently, stay focused, and never stop refining your technique.
In conclusion, mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling is a crucial skill that can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. By understanding the proper technique, positioning, and timing, wrestlers can effectively take down their opponents and gain an advantage in matches. The single leg takedown offers a versatile and reliable option for both offensive and defensive strategies, making it a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling. With consistent practice and dedication, wrestlers can develop their skills and become proficient in executing this technique. So, whether you are a beginner or an experienced wrestler, mastering the single leg takedown is an essential step towards achieving success in freestyle wrestling.

History of Freestyle Wrestling
Origins of Freestyle Wrestling
Freestyle wrestling has a rich history that dates back centuries. It is believed to have originated in ancient Greece and was an integral part of the Olympic Games. In fact, wrestling was one of the original Olympic sports when the Games were first held in Olympia in 776 BC.
The Greeks considered wrestling to be a prestigious sport and an important part of their culture. It was not only a physical competition but also a way to display strength, skill, and honor. Wrestling matches were highly regarded and attracted large crowds.
Development of Freestyle Wrestling Rules
Over time, the rules and techniques of freestyle wrestling evolved. The sport gained popularity in various parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, and the Americas. As it spread, different regions developed their own styles and variations of the sport.
In the late 19th century, the international governing body for wrestling, known as the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA), was established. FILA played a crucial role in standardizing the rules and promoting the sport worldwide.
The development of freestyle wrestling rules was a gradual process. Initially, matches were contested on mats with no time limits. However, as the sport became more structured, rules were introduced to ensure fair and competitive matches.
Today, freestyle wrestling is governed by specific rules and regulations set by FILA, which is now known as United World Wrestling (UWW). These rules dictate how matches are scored, the duration of matches, weight classes, and various techniques that can be used.
In conclusion, the history of freestyle wrestling is rooted in ancient Greece and has evolved over time to become a widely recognized sport worldwide. Its origins and the development of rules have shaped the sport into the dynamic and competitive discipline that it is today.
Basic Techniques in Freestyle Wrestling
Stance and Footwork
In freestyle wrestling, having a proper stance and footwork is essential to maintain balance and react quickly to your opponent’s moves. The stance involves positioning your feet shoulder-width apart, with one foot slightly in front of the other. This allows for better stability and mobility during the match.
Your weight should be evenly distributed between both legs, and your knees should be slightly bent to provide a solid base. Keep your back straight and maintain good posture throughout the match. This stance will enable you to move swiftly and maintain control of the match.
Takedowns and Throws
Takedowns and throws are the primary techniques used to score points in freestyle wrestling. These techniques involve using leverage, speed, and technique to take down your opponent to the mat. Here are some common takedowns and throws used in freestyle wrestling:
Single Leg Takedown: This technique involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs and driving forward to bring them down to the mat while maintaining control.
Double Leg Takedown: Similar to the single leg takedown, but instead, you grab both of your opponent’s legs and drive forward to take them down.
Fireman’s Carry: This throw involves lifting your opponent onto your shoulders and then rotating them over your back to bring them down to the mat.
Suplex: A high-amplitude throw where you lift your opponent off the ground, arching your back, and slamming them onto their back.
These techniques require practice and precision to execute effectively. Proper timing, positioning, and control are crucial to successfully execute takedowns and throws in freestyle wrestling.
Ground Techniques
Once you have taken your opponent down to the mat, it’s essential to have effective ground techniques to maintain control and score points. Here are some ground techniques commonly used in freestyle wrestling:
Gut Wrench: This technique involves grabbing your opponent’s waist from behind and rotating them over your body to expose their back to the mat, earning you points.
Leg Lace: This move involves entangling your opponent’s leg with your own and applying pressure to force them onto their back, scoring points.
Pinning Combinations: Various pinning combinations are used to secure your opponent in a position where both of their shoulders touch the mat simultaneously, resulting in a pin and a win.
Escapes and Reversals: These techniques are used to break free from your opponent’s control and gain the upper hand. They involve quick movements and skillful maneuvering on the ground.
Mastering ground techniques is crucial for scoring points and winning matches in freestyle wrestling. It requires a combination of strength, technique, and strategy to outmaneuver your opponent and gain control.
By understanding and practicing these basic techniques in freestyle wrestling, you will be well-prepared to excel in this dynamic and exciting sport. Remember to focus on proper stance and footwork, master takedowns and throws, and develop effective ground techniques to become a formidable freestyle wrestler.
Weight Classes and Competitions
Weight Classes in Freestyle Wrestling
In freestyle wrestling, competitors are divided into different weight classes to ensure fair and balanced competition. Each weight class has a specified range of weights that athletes must meet to be eligible to compete in that category. This categorization allows wrestlers to compete against opponents of similar size and strength, promoting a level playing field.
The International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) has established a standard set of weight classes for freestyle wrestling. These weight classes may vary slightly depending on the governing body or competition. Common weight classes in freestyle wrestling include:
Each weight class has its own unique challenges, strategies, and techniques. Wrestlers must carefully manage their weight to ensure they are within the specified range for their chosen weight class. In some cases, wrestlers may need to gain or lose weight in order to compete in a particular category.
Types of Competitions
Freestyle wrestling offers a variety of competitions for athletes to showcase their skills and abilities. Some common types of freestyle wrestling competitions include:
Individual Tournaments: Individual tournaments are the most common form of competition in freestyle wrestling. Wrestlers compete against others in their weight class in a bracket-style format. The goal is to advance through each round and ultimately win the tournament by defeating all opponents in their weight class.
Team Dual Meets: In team dual meets, two teams compete against each other in a series of matches. Each weight class is represented by a wrestler from each team, and they compete head-to-head. The team with the most wins at the end of the meet is declared the winner.
National Championships: National championships bring together the best wrestlers from a specific country to compete for the title of national champion. These championships are highly prestigious and often serve as a selection process for international competitions.
International Tournaments: International tournaments feature wrestlers from different countries competing against each other. Examples include the Olympic Games, World Championships, and Continental Championships. These tournaments showcase the highest level of freestyle wrestling and attract top athletes from around the world.
Scoring System in Freestyle Wrestling
Freestyle wrestling employs a unique scoring system to determine the winner of a match. Wrestlers can accumulate points through various techniques and maneuvers. The scoring system in freestyle wrestling includes:
Takedown: When a wrestler successfully takes their opponent down to the mat and establishes control, they are awarded two points.
Exposure: If a wrestler exposes their opponent’s back or shoulders to the mat while maintaining control, they earn two or four points, depending on the duration of exposure.
Reversal: If a wrestler reverses the position from being underneath to being on top of their opponent, they are awarded one point.
Escape: When a wrestler escapes from their opponent’s hold and moves to a neutral position, they earn one point.
Penalty: Wrestlers can also receive penalties for various infractions, such as passivity or illegal moves. Penalties result in points being awarded to the opponent.
The wrestler with the highest total points at the end of the match is declared the winner. If there is a tie, the wrestler who scored the last point is declared the winner. Understanding the scoring system is crucial for wrestlers to strategize and execute their moves effectively during a match.
Training and Conditioning for Freestyle Wrestling
Strength and Endurance Training
To excel in freestyle wrestling, athletes need to have a combination of strength and endurance. Building strength is crucial for executing powerful moves and maintaining control over opponents. Endurance, on the other hand, ensures that wrestlers can maintain their performance throughout the duration of a match. Here are some essential strength and endurance training exercises for freestyle wrestling:
Flexibility and Mobility Exercises
Flexibility and mobility play a crucial role in freestyle wrestling as they allow athletes to execute various techniques effectively and prevent injuries. Here are some flexibility and mobility exercises that every freestyle wrestler should incorporate into their training routine:
Mental Preparation for Wrestling
Freestyle wrestling requires not only physical strength but also mental fortitude. Wrestlers must be mentally prepared to face challenges, make split-second decisions, and persevere through grueling matches. Here are some strategies for mental preparation in freestyle wrestling:
By incorporating strength and endurance training, flexibility and mobility exercises, as well as mental preparation techniques into your training routine, you can enhance your performance in freestyle wrestling and take your skills to the next level. Remember to consult with a professional coach or trainer to customize your training program and ensure proper technique and safety.
Pre-Match Preparation and Strategy
Weight Cutting and Nutrition
Weight cutting is a crucial aspect of freestyle wrestling, as it allows athletes to compete in lower weight classes. However, it should be done safely and under proper guidance to avoid any negative impact on performance and health. Here are some important points to consider:
Warm-up and Stretching
Before stepping onto the mat, it is crucial to properly warm up your body to prevent injuries and enhance performance. Here are some warm-up and stretching techniques to consider:
Developing a Game Plan
Having a well-thought-out game plan can make a significant difference in the outcome of a freestyle wrestling match. Here are some steps to develop an effective game plan:
Remember, pre-match preparation and strategy are essential components of a successful freestyle wrestling performance. By following proper weight cutting techniques, warming up effectively, and developing a well-thought-out game plan, you can maximize your chances of victory on the mat.
Common Fouls and Penalties in Freestyle Wrestling
Illegal Holds and Maneuvers
In the intense sport of freestyle wrestling, there are certain holds and maneuvers that are considered illegal. These moves can result in penalties and even disqualification for the offending wrestler. It’s important for athletes to be aware of these illegal holds to avoid any unnecessary fouls.
Some common illegal holds and maneuvers in freestyle wrestling include:
Full Nelson: The full nelson is a dangerous move where a wrestler locks their hands behind their opponent’s neck and applies pressure. This hold can cause serious injury to the neck and spine and is strictly prohibited.
Suplex: A suplex involves lifting an opponent off the ground and slamming them forcefully onto their back. This move is considered dangerous and can lead to serious injury, so it is not allowed in freestyle wrestling.
Eye Gouging: Any deliberate attempt to poke or strike an opponent’s eyes is strictly forbidden. Eye gouging can cause severe harm and is considered unsportsmanlike conduct.
Unsportsmanlike Conduct
In the world of freestyle wrestling, sportsmanship and fair play are highly valued. Any behavior that goes against these principles is considered unsportsmanlike conduct and can lead to penalties. Wrestlers are expected to compete with integrity and respect for their opponents.
Examples of unsportsmanlike conduct in freestyle wrestling include:
Taunting: Mocking or provoking an opponent through words or gestures is considered disrespectful and unsportsmanlike. Taunting can create a hostile environment and is strictly prohibited.
Biting: Any intentional biting of an opponent is not only a violation of the rules but also a major breach of sportsmanship. Biting can cause injury and is completely unacceptable in freestyle wrestling.
Refusing to Engage: Freestyle wrestling requires active participation from both wrestlers. Refusing to engage in the match, stalling, or continuously avoiding contact is considered unsportsmanlike conduct and can result in penalties.
Penalty System in Wrestling
Freestyle wrestling has a well-defined penalty system to ensure fair play and maintain a level playing field. Penalties are imposed for various infractions, ranging from minor fouls to major offenses. It is crucial for wrestlers to understand the penalty system to avoid unnecessary point deductions or disqualification.
The penalty system in freestyle wrestling typically involves the following:
Verbal Warning: For minor infractions, such as stepping out of bounds or minor rule violations, a verbal warning is usually given by the referee. This serves as a reminder to the wrestler to correct their behavior.
Caution: If a wrestler commits a more serious foul, such as an illegal hold or unsportsmanlike conduct, a caution may be issued. This results in the opposing wrestler being awarded one point.
Penalty Points: In case of repeated fouls or more severe offenses, penalty points may be awarded to the opposing wrestler. Penalty points can range from one to four, depending on the severity of the infraction.
Disqualification: In extreme cases of unsportsmanlike conduct or repeated major fouls, a wrestler may be disqualified from the match. Disqualification results in an automatic loss for the offending wrestler.
Understanding the penalty system is crucial for wrestlers to compete effectively while adhering to the rules and maintaining fair play. It is important to note that intentional or repeated fouls can have serious consequences and tarnish the reputation of the sport.

Tips for Beginners and Novice Wrestlers
Mastering the Basics
Mastering the basics is crucial for beginners and novice wrestlers. Here are some tips to help you get started:
Learn the stances: Familiarize yourself with the neutral, top, and bottom stances. Practice maintaining a low center of gravity and having a strong base.
Focus on footwork: Footwork is essential in wrestling. Practice moving quickly and efficiently, both forwards and backwards. Work on your agility and balance to improve your overall performance.
Perfect your takedowns: Takedowns are fundamental in freestyle wrestling. Practice different takedown techniques such as single-leg, double-leg, and high crotch. Pay attention to your timing and positioning to execute takedowns effectively.
Master escapes and reversals: Being able to escape from the bottom position or reverse your opponent can give you a significant advantage. Practice techniques like stand-ups, switches, and granby rolls to improve your ability to escape and reverse your opponent.
Building Strength and Conditioning
To excel in freestyle wrestling, you need to develop your strength and conditioning. Consider the following tips:
Incorporate weight training: Focus on compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and rows to build overall strength. Include exercises that target the muscles used in wrestling, such as shoulders, legs, core, and grip.
Develop endurance: Wrestling requires both strength and endurance. Incorporate cardio exercises like running, swimming, or cycling into your training routine to improve your stamina and cardiovascular health.
Plyometric exercises: Plyometric exercises, such as box jumps, medicine ball throws, and explosive push-ups, can help develop explosive power and quickness. Incorporate these exercises into your training program to enhance your performance on the mat.
Flexibility and mobility: Maintain flexibility by incorporating stretching exercises into your routine. This will help improve your range of motion and reduce the risk of injuries. Additionally, focus on mobility exercises to enhance your agility and fluidity in movements.
Finding a Good Coach and Training Group
Having a knowledgeable coach and a supportive training group is essential for your growth as a wrestler. Consider the following tips:
Research local wrestling clubs or teams: Look for local wrestling clubs or teams in your area. Research their reputation and coaching staff to find a group that aligns with your goals and values.
Attend wrestling camps and clinics: Participating in wrestling camps and clinics can provide excellent opportunities to learn from experienced coaches and connect with other wrestlers. Look for reputable camps or clinics that focus on freestyle wrestling.
Seek recommendations: Reach out to experienced wrestlers or coaches within your network and ask for recommendations. They can provide valuable insights and suggest reputable coaches or training groups.
Evaluate coaching style and philosophy: When considering a coach or training group, evaluate their coaching style and philosophy. Look for someone who emphasizes technique, strategy, and physical development. A coach who prioritizes individual attention and creates a positive and supportive training environment can greatly enhance your progress.
Remember, success in freestyle wrestling takes time, dedication, and consistent practice. Focus on mastering the basics, building strength and conditioning, and finding the right coach and training group to optimize your development as a wrestler.
Equipment and Gear for Freestyle Wrestling
Wrestling Singlet and Shoes
One of the most essential pieces of equipment in freestyle wrestling is the wrestling singlet. A wrestling singlet is a one-piece outfit that is tight-fitting and designed to provide ease of movement during matches. It is typically made of stretchable fabric that allows wrestlers to move freely without restrictions. The singlet is designed to cover the entire torso and legs, ensuring that there are no loose or hanging materials that can be grabbed by opponents.
When it comes to shoes, wrestlers need to invest in specific wrestling shoes. These shoes are designed to provide traction on the mat while also offering support and comfort. Wrestling shoes have a high-top design that provides ankle support and helps prevent injuries. They are lightweight and have a thin sole to allow wrestlers to feel the mat and maintain balance during matches.
Protective Gear and Accessories
To ensure the safety of wrestlers, certain protective gear and accessories are necessary. One of the most important pieces of protective gear is a mouthguard. A mouthguard helps protect the teeth and jaw from impact and can help prevent injuries during intense matches. It is recommended to choose a mouthguard that is comfortable and specifically designed for sports like wrestling.
Additionally, headgear is commonly used in freestyle wrestling to protect the ears from injuries. The ears are susceptible to damage due to repeated friction and impact during matches. Headgear provides cushioning and support to the ears, reducing the risk of cauliflower ear and other ear-related injuries.
Other accessories that wrestlers may use include knee pads and elbow pads. These pads provide extra protection to the knees and elbows, which are often subjected to intense pressure and impact during wrestling moves and takedowns.
Mat Care and Maintenance
Proper mat care and maintenance are crucial for a safe and clean wrestling environment. Wrestling mats should be regularly cleaned and disinfected to prevent the spread of bacteria and skin infections. It is recommended to use a mild detergent and warm water to clean the mats, ensuring that all visible dirt and sweat are removed. After cleaning, the mats should be thoroughly dried to prevent the growth of mold and mildew.
Regular inspection of the mats is also important to identify any tears, rips, or damage that may pose a risk to wrestlers. Any damaged areas should be repaired promptly to maintain a safe wrestling surface. Additionally, it is essential to establish rules regarding footwear on the mats to prevent damage and maintain cleanliness.
By investing in the right equipment, gear, and accessories, and maintaining proper mat care, wrestlers can ensure a safe and enjoyable freestyle wrestling experience.

In the video below, 2008 Dave Schultz Memorial freestyle winner Angel Cejudo demonstrates how to defend the single leg takedown against larger opponents with the same techniques his brother, UFC champion Henry Cejudo, uses in the Octagon.","How to Defend the Single Leg Against a Bigger Opponent by Angel Cejudo
In an ideal match, you would be paired with somebody who relatively matches your size and weight. Obviously weight classes were established to safely pair up competitors on a level playing field, but you’re not always going to face someone who mirrors your body type. Whether you’re working with heavier opponents in the mat room or you’ve decided to bump up weight classes, you need to know how to work against this physical disadvantage.
With extra size comes another layer of stress when facing the takedown. In the video below, 2008 Dave Schultz Memorial freestyle winner Angel Cejudo demonstrates how to defend the single leg takedown against larger opponents with the same techniques his brother, UFC champion Henry Cejudo, uses in the Octagon.
Have a Back-Up Plan
One of the main premises that Angel discusses in the video with Bernardo Faria is always having a back-up plan. If your opponent is shooting on your leg, one of your first instincts should be to move your leg back. However, Faria has already gotten proper penetration on Angel and is now in position for the finish. Since Angel can’t move his leg back, his next response is to push Faria’s head down. Head positioning is a substantial part of finishing the single leg as it can be used as a directional indicator, so moving the head down to the mat prevents him from driving any further.

Spin and Grab the Waist
From here, Angel has Faria in a poor position, but his leg is still captured. Rather than looking to pull the leg out and create distance, Angel does the opposite: he looks to make a connection. He puts pressure on Faria’s head and shoulder, uses his free leg to push into him, and spins his free arm around to cover the waist.This gives Angle a chance to slip his leg out and cover the hips, securing his two takedown points. It may seem risky at first since you’re turning your back to your opponent while you spin, but you should have enough time to get to their waist quickly due to head pressure.
Additional Details
There are a few other salient points that need to be discussed regarding Angel and Faria’s positions throughout the exchange. When Angel is pressuring the head after the shot, he is also bringing his trapped leg down to the knee and keeping it bent. Staying on the knee gives him a pivot point to make the spin much easier to accomplish than merely having it extended. Faria’s hips are also higher than his head, so his drive is shut down. His insight as the offensive player at the end of the video is also important: as the larger opponent, he would be better off with Angel looking to sprawl rather than pressure the head. According to Faria, he would still be able to pull the leg in and drive through Angle based on his larger frame. By contrast, pressuring the head brings him down to Angel’s proverbial level.
Larger opponents come with their own unique set of hurdles, especially if they are on the offensive. By pressuring the head and coming up with back-up plans in case your first line of defense fails, you can work to defend the single leg against larger opponents like Angel Cejudo.

As you can see from the high crotch defense demonstration, sometimes you have to deal with an opponent who will get in on a good shot. While we ideally want to be on offense constantly, eventually you are going to need to unfold a strong defensive strategy.
Vic deals with his partner’s position by beginning to address the strong head position of his partner. This will serve as an adequate starting point to defend the high crotch. Now with his partner’s head going towards the mat, Vic begins to sprawl away from the high crotch.
However, Victor’s sprawl isn’t your average everyday sprawl. Avery’s sprawl involves some rotation with his upperbody as he reaches for the belly-whizzer. This helps him circle his body away from his partner’s shot. Here is where the belly-whizzer comes in handy because the leverage it generates on your partner, combined with the direction you are circling will cause them to flatten out if they maintain their grip on your leg.
Part of Victor Avery’s strategy is paying close attention to game-changing details. How he explains the leg curl concept and how it applies to his defensive strategy is a gem of a detail you could implement TODAY. Shutdown Defense is crammed with details just like this that can give you a technical edge over your opponent.
Understanding your opponent’s intentions can make a huge difference in your overall game. If you know how to execute a strong takedown there is a good chance you understand how to defend it. Vic demonstrates this throughout the high crotch defense demo.

This is a very effective way to take away your opponent’s ability to transition a high crotch to a single or a double leg. It brings the wrestling down to the mat where you have the advantage.
In this video, two time NCAA champion and Olympian Ben Askren shows how to sit the corner and four ways to finish from the position.
First, when someone shoots in on a high crotch, you have to get their shoulder to outside of your hips. Watch how Askren pushes on his partner’s lat and does a circular sit down to the mat. Also notice the position of his free leg, it is bent not straight. Once down on the mat, you can lock your hands in the crotch, lock around the body, or you can pull the torso and leg into you without locking your hands. The important thing is you keep everything tight together.

The first and easiest finish from this position is to hook the ankle with your free leg and post on the mat with your hand so you can rotate your hips and end up with a leg ride and a takedown.
A second finish you can do from this position is to roll them over if they are driving into you. If you feel them really pressuring into you, post your free foot on the mat in between your legs and roll them over their top shoulder. After the roll, you should end up on top and they will most likely be holding onto the leg. You can do a couple things from this position. One thing Askren shows in the video is to lock up a near side cradle. If it is available, this is a great way to earn a pin. If the cradle is not available, slide your hips back and circle towards your opponent’s feet and cross face them to get the takedown.
A third way to finish in this position comes when they try to turn back into you once you have the leg hooked. Since the leg is hooked, they can’t get their foot back, so when they try to turn into you, it brings their head and knee close together and anytime the head and knee are close, it is cradle time.
There is another cradle you can hit from the sit the corner position. To set it up, you are going to lock your hands low on the leg and high on the body then drive him onto his shoulder. The hand that is on the body comes out and you slide it around the head to lock up the cradle. Once it is locked up, take him over to his back for the pin.
In this video, Askren shows this series when someone hits a high crotch, but this also works when someone shoots a single leg on you. You just have to push their head to the outside position first, then you can sit the corner.
As you can see, there are a lot of options from sitting the corner. Just remember to stay tight so they can’t run you over with their hips.

Mastering the Single Leg Takedown in Freestyle Wrestling
Are you looking to enhance your skills in freestyle wrestling and dominate your opponents with ease? Look no further! In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the art of mastering the single leg takedown. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your technique, this article will provide you with valuable insights, tips, and step-by-step instructions to help you excel in this essential move. Get ready to take your freestyle wrestling prowess to new heights and leave your competitors in awe.
The Basics of the Single Leg Takedown
The single leg takedown is a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling that can provide a significant advantage over your opponent. It involves taking control of one of your opponent’s legs and bringing them down to the ground while maintaining control. Mastering this technique requires a combination of proper footwork, positioning, gripping techniques, and a well-executed level change and penetration step.
Footwork and Positioning
Having correct footwork and positioning is crucial for a successful single leg takedown. To begin, establish a solid wrestling stance with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. This stance allows for better balance and agility, enabling you to react quickly to your opponent’s movements.
When going for a single leg takedown, step forward with your lead leg towards your opponent’s lead leg. Your lead leg should be outside of your opponent’s lead leg, creating an angle that provides a better opportunity to attack. Maintain a low center of gravity, keeping your head up and eyes focused on your opponent’s upper body.
Gripping Techniques
Proper gripping techniques are essential for gaining control of your opponent’s leg during a single leg takedown. There are various gripping options, but two common techniques are the high crotch grip and the ankle pick grip.
The high crotch grip involves reaching your same-side arm across your opponent’s body and securing a hold on their upper thigh, just below their hip. This grip allows for better control and leverage when executing the takedown.
The ankle pick grip, on the other hand, involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle with your same-side hand. This grip is effective when your opponent’s leg is extended or when they resist the high crotch grip.
Experiment with different gripping techniques and find the one that works best for you based on your opponent’s positioning and reactions.
Level Change and Penetration Step
Executing a proper level change and penetration step is the key to successfully completing a single leg takedown. A level change involves dropping your level by bending your knees and lowering your hips closer to the ground. This motion helps you avoid your opponent’s attacks and allows for a smoother transition into the takedown.
After the level change, perform a penetration step by driving your lead leg forward and shooting it towards your opponent’s leg. Simultaneously, reach for your desired grip on their leg, either high crotch or ankle pick. The penetration step should be explosive and quick, catching your opponent off guard and making it harder for them to defend.
Remember to maintain a strong grip, keep your head up, and drive through your opponent’s leg as you finish the takedown. Proper execution of the level change and penetration step, combined with precise footwork and effective gripping techniques, will greatly increase your chances of mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Common Variations of the Single Leg Takedown
High Crotch
The high crotch is a powerful and effective variation of the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg with your head positioned on the outside of their body. By grabbing their leg with both hands, you can drive forward and lift their leg off the ground, taking them down to the mat. The high crotch is known for its versatility, as it can be executed from various positions and angles. It requires good timing, speed, and technique to successfully execute the high crotch and secure the takedown.
Ankle Pick
Another common variation of the single leg takedown is the ankle pick. As the name suggests, this technique involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle and pulling it towards you, destabilizing their balance and setting up the takedown. The ankle pick is often executed when your opponent is in a defensive stance or when they are attempting to sprawl to defend against a regular single leg takedown. By quickly snatching their ankle and driving forward, you can bring them down to the mat and gain control.
Knee Tap
The knee tap is a variation of the single leg takedown that focuses on targeting your opponent’s knee for a swift takedown. This technique involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg, much like a regular single leg takedown, but instead of grabbing their leg, you aim to tap or push their knee with your hand. By applying pressure on their knee and redirecting their momentum, you can force them off balance and bring them down to the mat. The knee tap is particularly effective against opponents who have a strong base and are difficult to lift off the ground.
These variations of the single leg takedown provide wrestlers with a range of options to take down their opponents in freestyle wrestling. Each technique has its own advantages and requires practice to master. By incorporating these variations into your arsenal, you can become a more well-rounded wrestler with multiple takedown options at your disposal.
Defending Against the Single Leg Takedown
Sprawling
Sprawling is a crucial defensive technique when countering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves using your hips and legs to create distance and prevent your opponent from getting a hold of your leg. To perform a sprawl effectively, follow these steps:
Remember, practicing sprawls regularly is essential to develop the speed, timing, and technique required to defend against the single leg takedown effectively.
Whizzer and Overhook
Another effective method to defend against the single leg takedown is by utilizing the whizzer and overhook techniques. These techniques are especially useful when your opponent manages to secure a grip on your leg. Here’s how to execute the whizzer and overhook:
By mastering the whizzer and overhook techniques, you can effectively neutralize your opponent’s single leg takedown attempts and gain an advantage in the match.
Front Headlock
The front headlock is another valuable defensive technique that can be utilized to counter the single leg takedown. This technique involves controlling your opponent’s head and arm to prevent them from successfully executing the takedown. Here’s how to perform a front headlock:
Practicing the front headlock technique will not only enhance your defense against the single leg takedown but also open up various offensive possibilities.
Remember, mastering these defensive techniques takes time, practice, and repetition. By focusing on your sprawl, whizzer and overhook, and front headlock skills, you will significantly improve your ability to defend against the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Drills to Improve Single Leg Takedown
Shadow Drilling
Shadow drilling is a fundamental training technique that helps wrestlers perfect their single leg takedown. By visualizing an opponent and performing the movements without actual resistance, wrestlers can focus on their form and technique. Here are some key drills to incorporate into your shadow drilling routine:
Stance and Motion: Start by assuming the proper wrestling stance, with your lead leg forward and your weight distributed evenly. Practice moving in and out of your stance, circling, and level changing. This drill helps develop agility and quick footwork, which are crucial for executing a successful single leg takedown.
Penetration Step: The penetration step is the initial move in a single leg takedown. Practice driving off your back leg, stepping forward with your lead leg, and shooting your arm deep between your opponent’s legs. Focus on explosive power and maintaining a low center of gravity throughout the movement.
Finish Position: Once you have secured your opponent’s leg, it’s important to practice the proper finish position. Work on driving through your opponent, lifting their leg, and keeping your head up. Pay attention to your hand placement and grip, as they significantly impact your control over your opponent.
Partner Drills
Partner drills provide a dynamic training experience that simulates real-life wrestling scenarios. These drills help develop timing, coordination, and the ability to react to an opponent’s movements. Incorporate the following partner drills into your training regimen to enhance your single leg takedown skills:
Leg Defense Drill: Have your partner stand in a defensive position while you attempt single leg takedowns. Your partner’s goal is to sprawl and defend against your takedown attempts. Focus on properly executing your takedown technique while your partner tries to counter and defend. This drill improves your ability to read and react to your opponent’s movements.
Resistance Drill: Start in a neutral position with your partner. Initiate a single leg takedown while your partner provides resistance, forcing you to exert more effort to complete the takedown. This drill helps build strength and endurance while maintaining proper technique under pressure.
Counter Drill: In this drill, your partner attempts a single leg takedown while you work on countering their move. Practice sprawling, sprawling and turning, or executing a defensive technique like a whizzer. This drill improves your defensive skills and teaches you how to disrupt your opponent’s takedown attempts.
Live Situational Sparring
Live situational sparring involves engaging in controlled wrestling scenarios with a partner. It allows wrestlers to apply their single leg takedown skills in a realistic, dynamic setting. Here are some situational sparring scenarios to incorporate into your training:
Starting from Neutral: Begin the sparring session from a neutral position, with both you and your partner on your feet. Focus on initiating single leg takedown attempts while your partner defends and counters. This scenario simulates the unpredictability of a real wrestling match and helps sharpen your takedown skills under live conditions.
Starting from a Specific Position: Start the sparring session from various positions, such as starting with one wrestler already in on a single leg. This situation allows you to practice defending against an opponent in a dominant position and finding opportunities to counter and execute your own takedown.
Live Wrestling with Specific Objectives: Set specific objectives for the sparring session, such as scoring points with a single leg takedown or successfully defending against your partner’s takedown attempts. This type of situational sparring helps wrestlers focus on particular aspects of their single leg takedown game and improve their overall strategy.
By incorporating these drills and sparring scenarios into your training routine, you can enhance your single leg takedown skills and become a more formidable wrestler in freestyle wrestling. Practice diligently, stay focused, and never stop refining your technique.
In conclusion, mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling is a crucial skill that can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. By understanding the proper technique, positioning, and timing, wrestlers can effectively take down their opponents and gain an advantage in matches. The single leg takedown offers a versatile and reliable option for both offensive and defensive strategies, making it a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling. With consistent practice and dedication, wrestlers can develop their skills and become proficient in executing this technique. So, whether you are a beginner or an experienced wrestler, mastering the single leg takedown is an essential step towards achieving success in freestyle wrestling.

High Crotch.","Step Up Your Shot Defense With These Techniques
Just like most other sports, defense is a very important part of wrestling. How your react when someone shoots in on you can determine if you get taken down or if you end up with two points after it is all said and done. There are three main types of shots in wrestling: single leg, double leg, and a high crotch and each one of these shots is defended differently.
Single Leg
To defend a head inside single leg, the first thing you want to do is get a whizzer, but as you will see in the video, Cejudo does not get the whizzer in deep. Instead, he does what he calls a “raptor whizzer” because he keeps his elbow tight to his side and makes hook with his hand and wrist. With his other hand, he is attacking the far wrist.

Another thing Cejudo does right away is moves his right leg from in between his opponent's leg to the outside so he can use it to pressure into his opponent and block. It is very important to move you leg to the outside to prevent your opponent from elevating the leg and putting you in an even worse position.
Once he has the raptor whizzer and has the leg blocking on the outside of the thigh, Cejudo is using his foot that is planted on the mat to drive into his opponent. It is very difficult to finish a single leg when you are moving backwards. Also, you will notice that Cejudo does not have inside head position, but if you can get your head to the inside, it makes it even more difficult for your opponent to finish the single leg.
Once you have defended the initial part of the single leg, the next thing to do is to get your leg back down to the mat. To do this, the hand that is down on the wrist is going to come under the chin and it will push up on the chin and you will turn and face your opponent.
The last step is to break the leg free. To do this, Cejudo locks over his opponent’s arms with an “S” grip and kicks the leg down to the mat and pulls the arms up.
High Crotch
In this video, two time NCAA champion and Olympian Ben Askren shows how to defend a high crotch by sitting the corner.
Sitting the corner really neutralizes an opponent after they shoot a high crotch in a couple of ways. First, it takes away the option of transitioning to a single leg or a double leg. It also takes takes a way the option for them to drive through you and lastly, it gives you an angle to attack them.
When you sit the corner, be sure to push your opponent to the outside. This takes away their ability to drive through you. Watch now Ben sits to the mat. He doesn’t just drop to his butt; he sits in a circular motion. Once you are down on the mat, you can lock in the crotch, around the waist, or pull them in tight to you. The big thing is to not give them space.
From here, Askren shows a couple different options. The easiest is to post up and get your hips on top so you end up on top in a leg ride position or you can roll them and end up on top and hit a near side cradle. He also shows two great cradle options from the sit the corner position.
Double Leg
In this last video, four time NCAA champion and world champion goes in depth how to defend a double leg.
Let’s break this video down a bit. First, whenever someone shoots a double on you, it is important that you meet them with your hips. Watch how Dake uses his hips to stop the momentum of his partner. This is very important, because if your opponent can blast you backwards with the double then turns the corner and drives across, it is very hard to defend. So you must stop it before it starts.

Another big thing that Dake goes over is moving your opponent’s head. There is a basic rule you can follow when defending shots, not just doubles. Put your opponent's head on the opposite position they want it to be. Basically, if they shoot a head inside single, put their head to the outside and then you sit the corner. If they shoot a double with their head on the outside stuff it to the inside. Where the head goes the hips follow, so if you can put the head in a bad position, the hips usually end up in a bad position.
After he stuffs the head to the inside, then sprawls to put his weight on his opponent. Watch how he circles to collapse his opponent down to take the power out of his opponent’s hips. Towards the end of the video, he even uses it to lock up a cradle.
These are all very effective shot defenses that are used in the highest levels of wrestling. Be sure to drill these defenses and try them when you are wrestling in practice. Really pay attention to the small details in the video because the small details often make a huge difference, especially with higher level competition.

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling. If you are passionate about this dynamic combat sport and want to enhance your skills in taking down opponents, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we will delve into the essential techniques, strategies, and training drills that will empower you to dominate your opponents on the wrestling mat. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your takedown abilities, this guide is designed to provide you with valuable insights and expert advice to take your freestyle wrestling game to the next level.
Understanding the Basics of Takedowns
Takedowns are a fundamental aspect of freestyle wrestling. They involve swiftly and strategically taking down your opponent to gain control or score points. Understanding the basics of takedowns is crucial for any wrestler looking to excel in this dynamic sport.
Different Types of Takedowns
Single Leg Takedown: This is one of the most common takedown techniques used in freestyle wrestling. It involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs and swiftly driving them off balance to bring them down to the mat.
Double Leg Takedown: Similar to the single leg takedown, the double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent’s legs and using your body weight to knock them off balance and bring them down.
High Crotch Takedown: This takedown technique requires you to shoot in towards your opponent’s legs, driving your shoulder into their midsection. From there, you can lift and maneuver them to the ground.
Fireman’s Carry: The fireman’s carry is a more advanced takedown that involves throwing your opponent over your shoulder while maintaining control of their upper body. It requires good timing and technique but can be highly effective when executed correctly.
Strategies for Setting up Takedowns
Establishing Control: Before attempting a takedown, it’s essential to establish control over your opponent. This can be achieved through hand fighting, maintaining good posture, and creating angles to disrupt their balance.
Creating Openings: Look for opportunities to create openings for takedowns by feinting or faking attacks. This can force your opponent to react, opening up opportunities for you to execute a takedown.
Using Combinations: Utilize combinations of attacks to keep your opponent guessing and off balance. By chaining together different takedown attempts, you can increase your chances of successfully executing a takedown.
Key Techniques for Executing Takedowns
Level Change: A crucial aspect of executing a successful takedown is the ability to change levels. This involves lowering your body position while maintaining good posture, making it harder for your opponent to defend against your takedown attempts.
Explosiveness and Speed: Takedowns require explosive and quick movements. By training your explosiveness and speed through drills and exercises, you can enhance your ability to execute takedowns effectively.
Maintaining Balance: It’s important to maintain your own balance throughout the takedown process. This allows you to stay in control and quickly transition to other techniques if necessary.
Finishing the Takedown: Once you have initiated a takedown, focus on finishing it strong. This involves driving through your opponent, using your entire body to maintain control, and securing a dominant position on the mat.
Mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling takes time, practice, and a deep understanding of the basics. By familiarizing yourself with different types of takedowns, employing effective strategies, and honing key techniques, you can elevate your takedown game and become a formidable force on the wrestling mat.
Developing Strength and Conditioning
In order to excel in freestyle wrestling and master the art of takedowns, it is crucial to focus on developing strength and conditioning. This aspect of training plays a vital role in enhancing performance on the mat. By incorporating specific exercises for building core strength, cardiovascular training for endurance, and emphasizing the importance of flexibility and agility, wrestlers can greatly improve their overall abilities.
Specific Exercises for Building Core Strength
Core strength is fundamental in freestyle wrestling as it provides stability and power for executing takedowns effectively. Incorporating specific exercises targeting the core muscles can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. Some effective exercises for building core strength include:
Plank: The plank is a simple yet highly effective exercise for strengthening the core. Start by assuming a push-up position and then lower your forearms to the ground. Hold this position while maintaining a straight line from your head to your feet. Aim to gradually increase the duration of the hold as your core strength improves.
Russian Twists: This exercise targets the oblique muscles, which are crucial for generating rotational power during takedowns. Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly, keeping your back straight. Hold a weight or medicine ball in front of your chest and twist your torso from side to side, touching the weight or ball to the ground on each side.
Leg Raises: Leg raises help strengthen the lower abdominal muscles, which are essential for explosive movements in wrestling. Lie on your back with your legs straight and your hands by your sides. Lift your legs off the ground while keeping them straight, and then slowly lower them back down without touching the ground. Repeat for multiple sets.
Cardiovascular Training for Endurance
Endurance is another crucial aspect of freestyle wrestling, as matches can be physically demanding and often require sustained effort. Incorporating cardiovascular training into your routine can greatly improve your endurance levels. Here are some effective cardiovascular exercises for wrestlers:
Running: Running is a great cardiovascular exercise that helps build endurance and stamina. Incorporate both steady-state running for longer durations and interval training to simulate the intensity of wrestling matches. Interval training involves alternating between high-intensity sprints and recovery periods.
Cycling: Cycling is a low-impact cardiovascular exercise that can be beneficial for wrestlers. Whether you prefer indoor cycling or hitting the roads, it provides an excellent way to improve your endurance. Vary the intensity of your rides by incorporating intervals or incorporating hill climbs to simulate the demands of wrestling.
Jumping Rope: Jumping rope is not only a great warm-up exercise but also an effective way to improve cardiovascular fitness. It is a high-intensity exercise that engages multiple muscle groups and helps improve coordination and footwork.
Importance of Flexibility and Agility
Flexibility and agility are key components of successful takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Being able to move swiftly and fluidly while maintaining balance is crucial for executing techniques effectively. Here are some important aspects to consider:
Dynamic Stretching: Incorporate dynamic stretching exercises into your warm-up routine before training or competing. Dynamic stretching involves continuous movement through a full range of motion and helps improve flexibility and joint mobility. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, and torso twists.
Plyometric Exercises: Plyometric exercises, such as box jumps or lateral bounds, help improve agility and explosive power. These exercises involve quick and powerful movements that enhance muscle elasticity and coordination.
Yoga or Pilates: Engaging in regular yoga or Pilates sessions can greatly improve flexibility, balance, and body control. These practices also promote core strength and stability, which are essential for executing takedowns with precision.
By incorporating these exercises and emphasizing the importance of strength and conditioning, core strength, cardiovascular training, flexibility, and agility, wrestlers can enhance their performance in freestyle wrestling and ultimately master the art of takedowns. Remember, consistent practice and dedication are key to achieving success in any sport.
Mastering the Mechanics of Takedowns
Proper Stance and Balance
In the world of freestyle wrestling, having a proper stance and balance is crucial to mastering the art of takedowns. Your stance determines your readiness and stability while engaging with your opponent. Here are some key points to remember:
Gripping and Controlling Techniques
Once you have established a solid stance, the gripping and controlling techniques play a vital role in executing successful takedowns. Here’s what you need to know:
Footwork and Timing
Apart from having a strong stance and effective gripping techniques, footwork and timing are essential components of mastering takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Consider the following factors:
By understanding and practicing the mechanics of takedowns, focusing on proper stance and balance, gripping and controlling techniques, as well as footwork and timing, you can elevate your freestyle wrestling skills to new heights. Mastering these fundamental aspects will greatly enhance your ability to execute effective takedowns and gain a competitive edge in the sport.
Countering and Defending Against Takedowns
Recognizing and Reacting to Opponent’s Attacks
In freestyle wrestling, the ability to recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks is crucial when countering and defending against takedowns. Being able to anticipate your opponent’s movements and understand their preferred techniques will give you a significant advantage in defending against their attacks.
To effectively recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks, it is essential to develop a keen sense of observation. Pay close attention to their footwork, body positioning, and any subtle cues that may indicate an impending takedown attempt. By studying your opponent’s patterns and tendencies, you can better prepare yourself to counter their attacks.
Quick reflexes and agility are key when reacting to your opponent’s attacks. As soon as you perceive an incoming takedown attempt, you must swiftly adjust your stance and position yourself to neutralize their attack. Maintaining a low center of gravity and keeping your balance will make it harder for your opponent to execute a successful takedown.
Effective Counter Techniques
Having a repertoire of effective counter techniques will greatly enhance your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are a few techniques that can be utilized to counter your opponent’s attacks:
Sprawl: The sprawl technique involves quickly extending your legs backward while dropping your hips to the mat. By doing so, you create a wider base and make it difficult for your opponent to secure a takedown.
Whizzer: The whizzer, also known as an overhook, is a defensive move where you use your arm to control your opponent’s attacking arm. This technique allows you to redirect their momentum and potentially gain an advantageous position.
Front Headlock: When your opponent attempts a takedown, you can react by securing a front headlock. This move involves wrapping your arms around your opponent’s head and controlling their upper body, preventing them from completing the takedown.
Granby Roll: The granby roll is an effective technique to counter a takedown and quickly regain control. It involves rolling away from your opponent’s attack while using your momentum to reverse the situation.
Defensive Strategies and Tactics
In addition to individual counter techniques, implementing defensive strategies and tactics can greatly improve your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are some defensive strategies to consider:
Maintain a Strong Base: By keeping a strong and balanced stance, you make it more challenging for your opponent to take you down. Focus on keeping your feet shoulder-width apart and distributing your weight evenly.
Hand Fighting: Engaging in hand fighting with your opponent can disrupt their attempts to initiate takedowns. By controlling their hands and wrists, you limit their ability to secure a successful takedown.
Circle and Angle: Instead of standing directly in front of your opponent, use circular footwork and angles to make it harder for them to shoot for a takedown. Constantly moving and changing angles forces your opponent to adjust and can create openings for counters.
Utilize Defensive Drills: Incorporate defensive drills into your training routine to improve your reflexes, timing, and defensive instincts. Practice scenarios where your opponent attempts takedowns, and focus on reacting quickly and effectively countering their attacks.
By recognizing and reacting to your opponent’s attacks, utilizing effective counter techniques, and implementing defensive strategies, you will enhance your ability to counter and defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Constant practice and refinement of these skills will lead to mastery and success on the wrestling mat.
Strategies for Competition
Creating an Effective Game Plan
Having a well-defined game plan is crucial in freestyle wrestling competitions. It allows wrestlers to approach matches with a strategic mindset, maximizing their chances of success. Here are some key steps to creating an effective game plan:
Study your opponent: Before the match, research and analyze your opponent’s previous performances. Look for patterns, strengths, and weaknesses that can be exploited during the bout. This information will help you develop a targeted strategy.
Identify your strengths: Assess your own wrestling style and identify your strongest techniques and moves. Build your game plan around these strengths to capitalize on your skills during the match.
Set specific objectives: Determine specific goals and objectives for the match. These could include scoring a certain number of takedowns, avoiding specific moves from your opponent, or dominating a particular position. Having clear objectives will keep you focused and motivated during the competition.
Practice your strategy: Once you have identified your game plan, practice it extensively during training sessions. Work on executing your chosen techniques and movements flawlessly to build muscle memory and confidence.
Analyzing and Exploiting Opponent’s Weaknesses
One of the most effective strategies in freestyle wrestling is identifying and exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses. By studying their previous matches and observing their style, you can develop a game plan that targets their vulnerabilities. Here’s how to go about it:
Watch their matches: Analyze your opponent’s previous matches to identify any recurring weaknesses or areas where they struggle. Pay attention to their reactions in different situations and take note of any recurring mistakes they make.
Identify common weaknesses: Once you have observed your opponent’s matches, look for common weaknesses that can be exploited. These could be technical flaws, predictable reactions, or vulnerabilities in certain positions. Understanding these weaknesses will help you plan your attacks accordingly.
Develop counter strategies: Based on the weaknesses you have identified, develop specific counter strategies. Practice techniques and moves that directly exploit your opponent’s vulnerabilities, allowing you to gain an advantage during the match.
Stay adaptable: While it is important to exploit your opponent’s weaknesses, it is equally crucial to adapt your strategy during the match. If your initial plan doesn’t yield the desired results, be prepared to make quick adjustments and capitalize on any new openings that arise.
Mental Preparation for Matches
Mental preparation plays a vital role in freestyle wrestling competitions. It helps wrestlers stay focused, confident, and resilient throughout the match. Here are some key aspects of mental preparation that can enhance your performance:
Visualization techniques: Before the match, spend time visualizing yourself executing your game plan flawlessly. Imagine each move, takedown, and counter in vivid detail. This mental rehearsal helps build confidence and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenges.
Positive self-talk: Replace negative thoughts and self-doubt with positive affirmations. Remind yourself of your strengths, skills, and previous successes. Repeat empowering phrases to boost your confidence and maintain a positive mindset.
Controlled breathing: Deep, controlled breathing techniques can help calm your nerves and reduce anxiety before and during the match. Practice rhythmic breathing exercises to center yourself and stay focused on the present moment.
Develop a pre-match routine: Establish a consistent pre-match routine that helps you get in the right mindset. This routine could include warm-up exercises, visualization sessions, or listening to motivational music. Having a routine creates a sense of familiarity and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenge.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of physical prowess and mental acuity. By strategizing effectively, exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses, and mentally preparing for matches, you can significantly enhance your performance on the mat.
Drills and Training Exercises
Partner Drills for Takedown Practice
One of the most effective ways to improve your takedown skills in freestyle wrestling is through partner drills. These drills allow you to practice your techniques in a controlled setting with a training partner. Here are some partner drills that can help you master the art of takedowns:
Double Leg Takedown Drill: Start by facing your partner in a wrestling stance. Initiate the drill by shooting in for a double leg takedown. Your partner should sprawl and defend while you focus on driving through and completing the takedown. Repeat this drill multiple times, alternating roles with your partner.
Single Leg Takedown Drill: Similar to the double leg takedown drill, this drill focuses on executing a single leg takedown. Begin by gripping your partner’s collar tie or wrist control, then quickly transition to a single leg attack. Your partner should defend by sprawling and countering. Practice this drill with both partners taking turns as the attacker and defender.
Hand Fighting Drill: Hand fighting is crucial for setting up takedowns and gaining control over your opponent. In this drill, focus on developing your hand fighting skills by engaging in controlled sparring with your partner. Work on establishing dominant grips, clearing ties, and creating openings for takedowns. Remember to maintain proper technique and intensity throughout the drill.
Solo Drills for Technique Refinement
In addition to partner drills, solo drills are essential for refining your takedown techniques and improving your overall performance in freestyle wrestling. These drills allow you to focus on specific movements and body mechanics without the need for a training partner. Here are some solo drills that can help you enhance your takedown skills:
Shadow Wrestling: Shadow wrestling involves simulating takedowns and defensive movements without a partner. Stand in front of a mirror or an imaginary opponent and practice your takedown techniques. Focus on proper footwork, hip movement, and penetration steps. Visualize your opponent’s reactions and work on your timing and precision.
Shot Drills: Shot drills are designed to improve your speed, explosiveness, and precision when shooting for takedowns. Set up a series of cones or markers on the ground, and practice shooting from various distances. Start slowly, focusing on proper form, and gradually increase your speed and intensity. Challenge yourself by incorporating level changes and fakes into your shots.
Resistance Band Drills: Resistance bands can be a valuable tool for developing strength and power in your takedown movements. Attach a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point and work on your takedown motions against the resistance. This will help you build explosive power and improve your ability to finish takedowns against tough opponents.
Live Wrestling and Scrimmage Sessions
While drills and solo exercises are essential for skill development, nothing can replicate the intensity and unpredictability of live wrestling. Engaging in live wrestling sessions and scrimmages is crucial for applying your techniques in real-time situations. Here are some tips for making the most of live wrestling sessions:
Focus on Applying Techniques: Use live wrestling sessions as an opportunity to practice the takedowns you’ve been drilling. Focus on executing your techniques against resisting opponents and adapting to their reactions. Pay attention to your positioning, timing, and setups during live situations.
Experiment and Learn: Live wrestling sessions provide a platform for experimentation and learning. Don’t be afraid to try new techniques or variations of existing ones. Take risks, analyze the outcomes, and learn from both successful and unsuccessful attempts. This will help you expand your arsenal of takedowns and develop a well-rounded skillset.
Seek Feedback and Spar with Different Partners: During live wrestling sessions, actively seek feedback from coaches, teammates, or more experienced wrestlers. They can provide valuable insights into your takedown techniques, positioning, and overall performance. Additionally, try to wrestle with a variety of partners to expose yourself to different styles and challenges.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires consistent practice, dedication, and a willingness to learn from both successes and failures. By incorporating partner drills, solo exercises, and live wrestling sessions into your training routine, you can significantly improve your takedown skills and become a formidable competitor in the sport.
In conclusion, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of technique, strength, and strategy. It is essential to understand the fundamentals of positioning, footwork, and timing to successfully execute takedowns. Additionally, building strength and endurance through regular training and conditioning is crucial for maintaining control and overpowering opponents. Moreover, having a strategic approach, such as setting up takedowns with feints or capitalizing on an opponent’s weaknesses, can greatly increase the chances of success. By continuously honing these skills and incorporating them into one’s training regimen, wrestlers can elevate their performance and become formidable competitors in the sport of freestyle wrestling.

Presenting...
Skill Development & Drills Pack
The Skill Development & Drills Pack features over 30 drills that can be used to develop technical skills to be effective in live matches.  This is a 3 DVD set.  The first DVD is all about the basics.  Use these drills to learn how to drill.  Most youth and high school wrestlers don’t understand the finer points to becoming a great driller.  The reps you gain during your drilling session are programming you for live competition.  If you are drilling with bad habits then you will wrestle with bad habits.
The second DVD is loaded with skill development drills.  These drills focus on specific positions that are often problem areas for youth and high school wrestlers.  The drills are designed to develop a flow between common skill sets that are need to win at all levels.  You will also have access to downloadable practice templates.  These routines are the exact skill sets that Coach Weber uses and have been developed over many years in the trenches.  Use the exact skill sets or modify with some the skills your wrestlers or team use.
The third DVD contains high intensity practice drills.  These drills will take your level of technical mastery to another level.  The practice drills will develop superb conditioning and develop the feel it takes to chain wrestle and score on the best competition.
What is all in this Skill Development & Drills Pack?
Skill Development Drills
5 Points Top Drill – Use this drill to develop a killer instinct on top.  Smothering the bottom wrestler by getting pinning combinations and flowing from one to the next will result in getting more pins and winning more close matches.
Angle & Down Blocking Drill – Develop the instincts and skills needed to find angles offensively and defensively.  This drill series will develop the positioning and motion needed to score points and defend against the best wrestlers.
Bottom Base Drills – This should be a daily drill.  Understanding what is important to maintaining a solid base and building a base is something that should be automatic.  Use this drill regularly and find your wrestlers not getting turned as much and getting out from the bottom much more effectively.
Bottom Chain Wrestling Drills – This is a great drill to use for conditioning as well as a feel for constant motion on the bottom.  It is common knowledge that when you stop moving on the bottom you are going to get in trouble.  Use this drill to teach wrestlers how to string multiple moves together until they get out.
Bottom Master Skill Set – Trying to master a million moves never works out.  Use this coaching method to make sure your team or wrestlers master what wins the big matches.  You can also use this tactic to prepare for a specific team or opponent.
Bull Dog Drill – Maybe the most important neutral drill we use.  Your wrestlers will know how to score and keep themselves out of trouble if they don’t finish their Single Legs right away.  They will finish more shots and take more shots because they will be confident in their ability to score when they get in on the leg.
Hand Fighting Drill – This drill is designed to develop the mentality that your wrestlers want to control the ties all the time, but if they don’t they will know how to clear their opponents tie and flow directly into their own offense.
Mid-Level Hi-C & Double Finishing Drill – Hips in and head up will become natural after executing this drill routinely.  If you are sick of watching your wrestlers get the corner cut on them or squashed every time they take a head to the outside shot then you need this drill.
Hi-Level Hi-C & Single Finishing Drill – Don’t get caught standing around when in on a good shot.  Use this drill to get your wrestlers moving their opponents and finishing their shots when they get to their feet.  Nothing is more frustrating than watching your wrestler get to the leg, they are on their feet but still don’t finish.  Nail this drill and that won’t happen any more.
Programming & Chain Wrestling Drills – A good wrestler is tricky on their feet.  When they start stringing techniques together and setting up their shots, then they will get the takedowns in the big matches.  This is a great drill to develop these skills.
Push – Hang – Circle – Pass Drill – Use this drill to teach your wrestlers to get physical and take their opponent out of position.  They will learn to use their feet and hands as well as how to effectively work the head with this drill.
Shot Defense Drill – This is one of the prettiest drills out there when done correctly, to me at least.  If you understand that solid shot defense is crucial to winning the big matches then you will love this drill.  This drill will give your wrestlers the proper instincts if an opponent does get past their head and hands and gets to their legs.
Stalking Drill – Learn to put the pressure on your opponent and work your scoring holds.  If they beat you to the punch and try to score first, you will have the natural reactions to beat them and score off their shot attempts at ease.  Get this drill down if you want to learn to break opponents.
Tie-up/Set-up Drill – Develop multiple ways to get to your favorite shots using this drill.  Put together skills sets that work for your team or wrestler and run them through this high paced drill.  You will see even your most one dimensional wrestlers start to open up more opponents.
Intense Practice Drills “Unleashed”
The BAD Drill – High paced practice drill focused around dominating from neutral.
The Demon Drill – Hands down, best drill to teach wrestlers how to attack. (Great for all sizes)
The Fury BAD Drill – Squash the “Scramblers” on every takedown by using this killer drill.
Down Block Drill – Smother opponents and build the “He shoots… I score” mentality
Re-shot & Quick Score Drills – Relentlessly pick your opponent apart and break their will with this drill.
Over Under Around Drill – This drill does a better job developing a wrestler into a chain wrestling machine than any other drill I have seen.
Sparring - Learn the tactic the Russians use to develop their wrestlers. Sparring is the closest thing to live you’ll get and it will probably get you more tired. Watch your wrestlers bring everything together and look better than ever before after utilizing this training tactic for just a short while.
Attack Style Drill Basics
How to Drill – A breakdown of how to drill properly.  How your drill partner should be reacting.  How to properly work into a drill.  Some golden rules of drilling that you must follow in order to for it to count.
Stance and Motion Drill – This is a great series to work regularly into warm ups and conditioning.  Program your wrestlers to stay low, penetrate properly, move their feet and hands along with other important skills in your stance.
Pressure Drill - This is the drill I use to teach wrestlers, of all skill levels, how to get ahold of their opponent and put serious pressure on them.  Stalking and smothering opponents will become natural for your team after using this drill regular.
Get on the Head –  Getting an entire team to start working the head will make them more physical and will instantly increase their ability to get more takedowns.  Use this drill to break it down for your team and start getting more Front Headlocks, Leg Attacks, Go Behinds and much more…
Hand Fighting 101 - Youth and high school wrestlers will understand what it means to Hand Fight after using this drill.  Watch your wrestlers start dominating the tie ups, developing better defense and scoring more points.
Working From the Open - Every team will always have some quick wrestlers that like to sting from the outside.  The best outside wrestlers know how to move in and out and still stay physical.  This drill will have even your finesse wrestlers banging on their opponents, keeping them off balance and getting to the legs that much easier.
Finding Angles Okay, now we are cooking! When your wrestlers start to  recognize the openings most people miss from angles, getting take downs will be like taking candy from a baby.
Score From Opponents Action - I Shoot… I Score, You Shoot… I Score… Do you know who coined this? If not, you might want to start doing your homework. Getting easy takedowns off your opponents shots is what we call FUN!
Chain Wrestling - When every team figures out how to do this, wrestling is the most popular sport on the planet! Master this drill/mentality and watch the jaws drop in the stands when your team wrestles.
Score From Opponents Ties - This is what the Big Timers do. Get takedowns when your opponent feels in control. When you start doing this you can feel their will leave the mat.
Top Drills - Learn to smell blood. Right after a takedown is the best time to start working for the pin. Develop a relentless style from the top & take your game where most people never go.
Bottom Drills - You ever break someone from the bottom? I have and I have seen other do it. That’s when you really know you own your opponent.

Connecting",0.96682,Front Headlock & Stuck Under Counters | Spark Wrestling,https://www.sparkwrestling.com/lessons/front-headlock-and-stuck-under-counters,"The Front Headlock is a very dangerous position for the defensive guy, and an extremely controlling position for the guy on offense. Whenever your opponent is hanging his head down a little you can snap his head down. You can also get this if your opponent takes a bad shot and you sprawl good enough that he's not on your legs or barely has them.","#8: Front Headlock & Stuck Under Counters
The Front Headlock is a very dangerous position for the defensive guy, and an extremely controlling position for the guy on offense. Whenever your opponent is hanging his head down a little you can snap his head down. You can also get this if your opponent takes a bad shot and you sprawl good enough that he's not on your legs or barely has them. It's very easy to control your opponent with a Front Headlock and if used correctly you should be able to get a takedown.
You will pull his head underneath your chest. Grab the chin with your right hand while keeping your elbow high so it's harder for him to grab it. Your arm should be fairly shallow. You can even grip the neck, making your elbow even harder to reach. Your right shoulder should be digging into his trap muscle on the left side of his neck. With your left hand, you'll grab the opposite arm and lift it up. Keeping one of his arms elevated makes it so he can only use one to either support himself or defend his position. If you stuff his arm above his head it will warm his upper-body and make him especially uncomfortable. You can be over the arm or underneath it, but we recommend being over unless you're trying to get a Cement Job and other related moves.
Ideally, you'll want to snap him down to the mat and finish from there. You have more control on the mat than on your feet.
Front Headlock On Feet
You'll have the Front Headlock, but both you and your opponent will be standing on your feet. So this is before you snap him down to the mat. Usually you'll get here while hand-fighting or if he takes a bad shot but doesn't fully commit and you snap the head under your chest. You can control this by lifting the arm up with your arm on the outside, or by having your arm under his arm (Under-Hook, Cement Job). I recommend you try to keep your hand on the outside to lower the chances of him grabbing both elbows and forcing a stalemate.
Front Headlock Defense On Feet
Your head is stuck under his chest so he has a Front Headlock. The goal is to get out of this position as soon as possible before it gets any worse. You can shoot out of most tie-ups, but for this one I want you to get out of it first before you attack. These moves have that goal in mind. If you try to shoot under a Front Headlock there's a very good chance that an experienced wrestler will feel this start to happen and he'll sprawl on you, making the situation worse for yourself. Do not dig yourself a bigger hole. Do not get into a false sense of security thinking that moves that work against bad wrestlers will work against good wrestlers. Remember: your style should not change depending on who you're wrestling. You need to have consistent and good technique if you want to win consistently. Don't use bad technique just because you can. Develop good habits that you'll need to use against good wrestlers.
Front Headlock On The Mat
This would be when you have the Front Headlock but down on the mat. Your opponent will be on his hands and knees, you should be off of your knees to improve your mobility and to put more pressure or weight on your opponent. You can snap his head down repeatedly (bounce the head) to break him down and keep his weight on his hands, but don't do it too often or too aggressively or you'll end up giving up Unnecessary Roughness call.
Front Headlock Defense On The
When you're on the mat and stuck in a Front Headlock, you should probably grab an elbow and pull it down as soon as you can. This will secure your position a little bit and give you time to improve your situation. It'll also limit the amount of attacks the top wrestler can use and it will keep him in front of you. You can grab the chin hand with two hands and post it down, but it's a little bit more dangerous because the top guy has a lot more mobility in this situation compared to when you're on your feet. He can start to spin around you and with his weight on you it's harder to match his rotation. Grabbing the elbow solves this a little better.
Front Headlock Short Offense
To me this means you'll be keeping your arms short, hands over top of the head and/or shoulders. This way your opponent cannot grab your elbows and slow you down in this position. You'll have a lot more mobility, but you will have less control of your opponent. Make sure you keep your hips low, knees off the mat, feet wide and back. You don't want to run into a random shot, and you don't want to lose him completely.",0.95528,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wrestling locks are essential techniques that allow wrestlers to gain control over their opponents, enabling them to manipulate their bodies and create advantageous positions. These locks require a combination of strength, technique, and strategic thinking. In this article, we will explore some of the most prominent wrestling locks, including headlocks, leg locks, wrestling lock-ups, key locks, and ankle locks, highlighting their effectiveness and application in the world of wrestling.
What this article covers:
Wrestling Headlocks:
Headlocks are among the most recognizable and commonly used locks in wrestling. This technique involves securing an opponent's head under your arm, applying pressure to control their movement and limit their options. Headlocks can be executed from various positions, such as standing, on the ground, or in a clinch. Wrestlers often utilize headlocks to set up takedowns, transitions, or to control their opponents' posture.
Leg Lock Wrestling:
Leg locks in wrestling are powerful maneuvers used to immobilize or submit an opponent by targeting their lower extremities. These locks primarily focus on the knees, ankles, or feet. Techniques such as the single-leg takedown, double-leg takedown, or various leg submissions fall under the category of leg lock wrestling. Wrestlers with a strong leg lock game can disrupt their opponents' balance and gain advantageous positions.

Wrestling Lock Up:
The lock-up is the initial contact between two wrestlers at the beginning of a match. This crucial moment sets the tone for the rest of the bout. The lock-up involves wrestlers gripping each other's upper bodies, typically collars or arms. It's a test of strength and technique, where wrestlers try to gain control over their opponent's posture and position. The lock-up serves as a foundation for various takedowns, throws, and other offensive techniques.
Key Lock Wrestling:
The key lock, also known as a figure-four armlock or Americana, is a submission hold commonly used in wrestling. It involves controlling an opponent's arm by applying pressure on their elbow joint. By manipulating the arm into a vulnerable position and exerting force, wrestlers can cause significant pain or even force their opponent to submit. The key lock is an effective technique in both ground wrestling and transitions.
Ankle Lock Wrestling:
Ankle locks are highly effective leg submissions that target the ankle joint. Wrestlers employ these locks to immobilize or force their opponents to submit. By applying pressure on the foot and twisting or hyperextending the ankle, a wrestler can elicit tremendous discomfort and potential injury. Ankle locks are commonly used in grappling competitions and mixed martial arts, showcasing their effectiveness in controlling an opponent's lower body.

Wrestling locks encompass a wide range of techniques that allow wrestlers to control their opponents, gain advantageous positions, and potentially force them to submit. From the fundamental headlock and lock-up to the more specialized leg locks, key locks, and ankle locks, mastering these techniques requires a combination of strength, technique, and strategy. Wrestlers who incorporate wrestling locks into their arsenal enhance their ability to dominate their opponents and achieve success on the mat.

Wrestling / Catch Wrestling
Catch Wrestling
Catch wrestling refers to the classical grappling style with modified rules or a combat sport, which is different thanks to traveling funfair wrestlers who discovered and developed their submission holds, also known under the name “hooks”.
There are so many catch wrestling forms all around the world.
Why Is It Called Catch Wrestling?
The name catch wrestling appeared because there are fewer limits in catching and holding compared to, for example, Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling. Many more submissions and holds are allowed, and catch wrestlers can hurt their foes with so many various techniques. For example, any MMA matches are finished via catch wrestling techniques.
Many dangerous techniques were banned when the sport joined the Olympic family back in 1904. Later amateur catch wrestling was recognized as “freestyle wrestling”. It was separated from dangerous catch style.
Rules And Requirements
The ultimate goal of catch wrestling is to defeat your opponent by pinning him to the mat (his both shoulder blades or any part of the shoulders should remain on the ground) while not going for a submission attempt (in that case, you cannot win the bout).
You can also defeat the opponent via submission in a catch wrestling fight (force him to surrender by causing pain via legitimate technique in a controlled way).
As soon as the opponent taps or the referee confirms that the pin has happened, catch wrestlers must release the hold right off the bat. Breaking these rules leads to an instant disqualification for the catch wrestler.
You are not allowed to eye gouge, bite, kick, fish hook, or hair grab your opponent. Individual finger locks are illegal (no toe hold), alongside full nelson and clothes grabbing. Talking during the catch wrestling combat is one of the greatest fouls, and it can lead to a disqualification too.
WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE
Here is the list of legal techniques in a catch wrestling combat (even Brazilian jiu jitsu isn’t that liberal, this could work well in an MMA tournament too):
Many notable MMA fighters (for example, Josh Barnett) come from catch wrestling backgrounds for a reason – catch as catch can offer so many different ways to finish your rival legally! Josh Barnett might be the most famous western catch wrestler in mixed martial arts thanks to his outstanding successes in Pride FC and other high-level promotions.
There are so many tremendous leg locks in this fighting discipline too.
MATCHES
The pre-match catch wrestling requirements include the following:
TIME SCALES
Catch wrestling competitors must be ready for the competition. Once their name is called they have one minute to appear on the mats, failing to do so will lead to instant disqualification.
NOTIFICATION OF MATCHES
The pairing table will provide you with all the info – your fight number, the name of your opponent, and the potential time.
LENGTH OF MATCHES
There were no time scales in catch wrestling combats throughout history, as matches lasted until one fighter was unable to continue until one of the catch wrestlers wins via pin or a submission. But time restrictions appeared as the sport evolved.
You will get all the rules on the tournament invitation letter, the evening schedule is planned. Yet, there is no break or rest period once the catch wrestling match commences. The ref can only call an injury time-out, but you are not allowed to ingest fluid or water during the combat.
Most matches are contested as the best two or three falls, with a maximum length of an hour. If there is no pin or submission, the ref will decide the combat winner, depending on who was more dominant catch as catch can wrestler throughout the combat.
INJURY TIME
The referee or the medic has the right to call for an injury time when it’s required. Sometimes the bout could lead to the termination of the catch wrestling battle, especially in the case of excessive bleeding that can’t be stopped within a reasonable timescale.
There is no strict time for a medical timeout, but a medic has the right to prevent an athlete from continuing combat submission wrestling if he believes he’s endangered.
SAFE ZONE RULES
Catch wrestling matches will take part on approved, safe mats. When the wrestler in catch wrestling contests leaves the fighting area during the combat in the disadvantage position, the ref gets both fighters to the center of the mat to the previous position before the foul.
When nobody was in the dominant position before the fighters left the mat, the referee will restart the bout in the center from the standing position.
How Do You Win In Catch Wrestling?
The best way to win a catch wrestling combat is via submission or a pin. Yet, a chokehold is barred often too. In those cases, there is absolutely no doubt who won the catch wrestling combat.
In other cases, there are matches contested as the best two of three falls. When there is no winner after an hour (or shorter, depending on the tournament rule set), the referee will determine the dominant wrestler and give him a win due to superiority.
What Is The Difference Between Wrestling And Catch Wrestling?
Classic wrestling is more about dominant positions and point domination. Catch wrestling is the parent style of both freestyle wrestling and professional wrestling, it is present in earlier folk styles.
For example, Greco-Roman limits grabbing under the waist, while in freestyle you can use all kinds of techniques to trap your opponent and pin him to the canvas. In catch wrestling, you’ll rarely see the fight going the distance, as your ultimate goal is pinning or submitting the opponent.
But catch wrestling also adds a Brazilian jiu jitsu aspect, as you are allowed tons of submissions and finishes. Unlike in Judo competitions, the majority of leg locks and joint manipulations are perfectly legal. Catch wrestling moves are awesome for mixed martial arts combat too!
There’s way more grappling game and freedom to force your opponent to tap out. A good catch wrestler might have an equal or even better submission game compared to BJJ practitioners!
Catch-as-catch-can Meaning
According to the Oxford dictionary, catch-as-catch-can (archaic syntax) refers to “wrestling where all kinds of holds are allowed”. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, it symbolizes “using any available means or method”.
Origin Of Catch-as-catch-can
This sport was developed by J.G. Chambers in Great Britain in 1870. Catch wrestling was derived from many different forms of wrestling – a few versions of English wrestling styles – Lancashire, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and popular Irish collar-and-elbow style).
Professional wrestling used to be a competitive catch wrestling, and the historical World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship occurred in 1905 to discover the best catch wrestling guy in the world. The belt was retired in 1957.
Modern-day professional wrestling has some similarities with ancient catch wrestling, but aerial stunts and acrobatics, alongside striking, were turned into a spectacle to keep the crowd entertained.
Catch As Catch Can Wrestling Techniques
There are so many techniques available for a great catch wrestler, but we will focus on the six basic areas of the sport. Here they are:
Catch Wrestling Vs Freestyle
The freestyle wrestling method prevalent offers a lot of liberality compared to, for example, the Greco-Roman style. You can hold under the belt and trip your opponent in any way possible, just like catch wrestling.
But freestyle wrestling combat uses legs for manipulations, trips, and takedowns, there is a lack of submission game compared to catch wrestling. Freestyle fighters mostly roll and use the legs to get into the dominant position, while catch as catch can bois tend to submit the leg.
The dominant position or high throw amplitude matters in a freestyle combat submission wrestling bout, but in a catch bout, points aren’t important at all as bouts very often finish inside the distance and your ultimate goal is to finish your foe.
Difference Between Catch Wrestling And Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
The greatest difference is the lack of takedowns in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. When a BJJ fighter enters mixed martial arts matches, he’s mostly having a hard time dragging the fight to the ground, while a catch wrestler is very skillful in dragging the combat to the canvas.
Gi submissions are another important difference. For example, you cannot perform bow and arrow choke in a no-gi wrestling combat. Neck cranks are very much rare in BJJ, but submission switches are interestingly more often in modern jiu jitsu.
What Is A Hook In Combat?
Hooks is a term in grappling martial arts which represents the careful positioning of your feet and leg to control and manipulate the movement of your foe. For example, there is a rear-naked choke with both hooks in (legs around the waist) or from a body triangle (legs wrapped around the opponent’s waist in figure four).
Hooks are a great way to not let the opponent slip out of your dominant position. A hook specialist doesn’t have to be super-powerful to control his opponent on the canvas – and catch wrestling rolling is based on the excessive use of hooks!
What Is Japanese Wrestling Called?
Japanese professional wrestling is called “puroresu”. You will lose the combat when you’re out of the ring or when any part of your body (not feet) touch the ground. It’s Japan’s martial art.
But Japanese professional wrestlers also compete in shoot wrestling, where you have pretty much similar rules to normal catch wrestling. Many shoot wrestling fighters show great results in the mixed martial arts boom thanks to their great knowledge and understanding of submissions, especially leg manipulations.
If you love squared rings, please watch Shinja Aoki, you’ll see what am I talking about.
Catch Wrestlers
There are catch wrestlers from nine states of the world at the moment – America, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Great Britain, Estonia, Iran, and Japan.
Japanese fighters with a catch background are the most famous in MMA. But other famous names from different states include Jose Aldo, Eddie Alvarez, Demetrious Johnson, Ken Shamrock, Frank Trigg, and others.
Main Catch Wrestling Tournaments
Catch Wrestling Association, also known under the nickname of German professional wrestling promotion, hosts many catch wrestling tournaments, but the most famous ones are:

In this piece, we will delve into the intricacies of this rule, while also exploring various wrestling techniques such as the headlock, wrestling locks, leg lock wrestling, key lock wrestling, and ankle lock wrestling.
What this article covers:
Understanding the Wrestling Locked Hands Rule:
The wrestling locked hands rule, also known as the locked-hands violation, is a regulation implemented to prevent a wrestler from gaining an unfair advantage during certain positions. This rule typically comes into play when a wrestler wraps their arms around their opponent's waist or body and then proceeds to lock their hands together in a specific manner. The violation occurs when the wrestler maintains the locked hands for an extended period, restricting their opponent's freedom of movement and potentially impeding their ability to defend or counterattack.

Wrestling Headlock:
While the locked hands rule primarily focuses on controlling the opponent's body, the wrestling headlock plays a prominent role in the sport. By encircling the opponent's head with an arm, the wrestler can assert control, limit their movement, and set up various offensive or defensive maneuvers. It is essential to execute the headlock correctly to avoid triggering the locked hands violation while effectively utilizing it as a strategic tool within the confines of the rules.
Wrestling Locks:
Wrestling locks encompass a range of techniques that target specific areas of the opponent's body, exploiting joints and restricting movement. While some locks may come into conflict with the locked hands rule, others can be employed within its boundaries. Arm locks, wrist locks, and key locks, when executed correctly and without violating the locked hands rule, provide wrestlers with opportunities for control and potential submissions, showcasing their technical prowess and understanding of the rule set.
Leg Lock Wrestling:
As the locked hands rule primarily pertains to upper body engagement, leg lock wrestling allows wrestlers to focus on manipulating their opponent's lower extremities. Techniques such as the figure-four leg lock or ankle lock can be applied strategically, targeting the legs and ankles to compromise balance, hinder mobility, or force a submission. Wrestlers skilled in leg lock wrestling must be cautious not to violate the locked hands rule when attempting to secure these locks, requiring precision and adaptability.
Key Lock Wrestling and Ankle Lock Wrestling:
The key lock and ankle lock are powerful techniques in wrestling, relying on precise control and manipulation of the opponent's joints. However, wrestlers must execute these techniques while adhering to the locked hands rule. The key lock involves isolating and manipulating the shoulder joint, while the ankle lock focuses on applying pressure to the ankle. Wrestlers well-versed in these techniques must be aware of their hand positioning and timing to avoid triggering a locked hands violation.

In the realm of wrestling, the locked hands rule serves as a safeguard against potential imbalances and unfair advantages. Wrestlers must navigate this rule while skillfully employing techniques like the headlock, wrestling locks, leg lock wrestling, key lock wrestling, and ankle lock wrestling. By understanding and adhering to the regulations, wrestlers can showcase their proficiency, adaptability, and strategic thinking within the confines of the rule set, ensuring a fair and competitive environment for all participants.

Catch Wrestling ( What It Is and How To Get Started )
With the rise of submission grappling such as the ADCC World Wrestling Championship, catch wrestling is starting to become more and more popular. Though catch wrestling has been around for a long time, there are still many people who don’t know what it is.
Catch wrestling is a grappling art popularized by John Graham Chambers in the late 1800s. It is also widely accepted as the parent art of folkstyle and freestyle wrestling. Catch wrestling contains takedowns, pins, and submissions.
Today catch wrestling is not as popular as it once was, however, it does seem to be picking up steam again. As MMA and competitive grappling is becoming more popular many people are starting to look back into this amazing grappling art.
After all, many MMA stars and even UFC champions have come from a background in catch wrestling. In addition, many are looking to catch wrestling to help improve their no-gi grappling game. This grappling art has so much to offer to the no-gi grappling community.
What Is Catch Wrestling
Catch wrestling was by most accounts established by John Graham Chambers in 1871. However, he was perhaps simply the one to introduce the concept of catch as catch can wrestling to the world.
That said, catch wrestling was probably already being practiced before this. That is at least in a less formal way.
It was heavily influenced by other English, Irish, and even Indian wrestling styles. For the most part, it was a sport practiced by blue-collar workers.
It was popular in many of the coal mines and logging camps in England where workers would put bets on the wrestlers.
English Roots Of Catch Wrestling
This was a popular source of entertainment before blue-collar workers could simply go home and watch TV. Many of these techniques were taught to these young workers by the British Navy who learned grappling techniques from all across the globe.
The goal of each competition was to either pin their opponent or cause them to tap out via submission. It truly was a hybrid grappling style that consisted of techniques from many other styles.
Some of the more popular submissions include neck cranks and leg locks. Though still considered a brutal martial art today, catch as catch can wrestling was extremely brutal when it started. Thankfully, the rules have been tamed down a bit since then.
Rules Of Catch Wrestling
The rules of catch wrestling are pretty simple. A wrestler wins either by submission or pin. Pretty much any submission ( with the exception of the Full Nelson ) is allowed as long as it is a crank, joint lock, or choke.
Of course, you cannot submit by pulling on their nostrils or fish-hooking them. But pretty much any standard submission is allowed. This would include:
The other way to win in catch wrestling is to pin your opponent’s shoulders to the ground for three seconds. Some tournaments will have multiple rounds whereas some might only have one.
Either way, you must win via pin or submission. Historically, there are no time limits in catch wrestling. Instead, the match goes until there is a submission or pin.
In addition, it is strictly a grappling art so there are no strikes allowed either.
Catch Wrestling Techniques
To get their opponent to submit, catch wrestlers use different techniques, some more brutal than others. Here are some of them:
Catch wrestling has a ton of great takedowns. Most wrestling takedowns from other styles and MMA originated from catch wrestling.
This would include double-leg takedowns, single-leg takedowns, body locks, and just about everything else.
The big difference is that the only way to win in catch wrestling is by pin or submission. So even though you must take your opponent to the ground to pin them in catch wrestling, you do not get points as you do in other wrestling styles.
The leg locks involve holding the leg in positions that limit its movement. It targets different leg joints, such as the knee, hip, ankle, and foot.
Each move has a name that corresponds with the locked part. For example, the knee lock targets the knee, and the ankle lock targets the ankle.
This technique can render an opponent relatively immobile. On introducing certain twists, the opponent’s back can get pinned against the floor, or they can submit due to an injury threat to their lower body.
Leg locks have always been a big part of catch wrestling. So you could say that it was way ahead of the current leg lock trend going on in BJJ today.
The arm locks are similar to a leg lock, except that it focuses on the arm. It renders the arm relatively immovable, with the joints being either hyper-flexed or hyper-extended.
The lock can be applied to different parts of the arm, to create the shoulder lock, wrist lock, hammerlock, and armbar.
Also called chest choke, the chest lock involves the use of the arm and shoulder, wrapped around an opponent’s head from the hind, with the hips facing their head to hold them in that position.
The aim is submission. It hyperextends the opponent’s spine and bends his head towards you as you apply pressure with your locked arms.
It causes breath disruption and will effectively lead to submission if your opponent cannot get out of the hold.
Another thing that separates BJJ submissions from catch wrestling submissions is the use of neck cranks. These brutal and painful submissions rely on you cranking the neck of your opponent until they submit.
Of course, today many in the no-gi BJJ circles are starting to adopt neck cranks into their arsenal, but it has been part of catch wrestling from the start.
Catch Wrestling’s Influence In America
In the late 1800s to the mid-1900s catch as catch can become more popular in America. It was then further refined and popularized by local carnival wrestlers.
They would put on an athletic show where contestants could win cash if they could pin or submit the wrestler. These wrestlers would prefer to submit their opponents that way there was no debating whether or not they were fully pinned.
This caused catch-as-catch to become a more aggressive style where the wrestler would ” Catch” a limb to quickly twist or crank their opponent into submission.
Though these wrestlers knew strangles and chokes they were typically not allowed in most events. Because of this catch wrestling became more well-known for its neck cranks, leg locks, and other joint locks.
Catch Wrestling And Luta Livre
Catch wrestling was also very influential in Brazil and is the main parent art of Luta Livre. Euclydes Hatem is considered to be the founder of the Brazilian martial art known as Luta Livre.
Euclydes was a Brazilian catch wrestler of Lebanese descent. He began to teach catch wrestling to others around 1927.
Of course, he would also come up with many of his own techniques as well as adopt techniques from other arts such as judo. All in all, however, I think the biggest influence on Lutra Livre certainly has to be catch wrestling.
Lutra Livre is even called Brazilian wrestling in some circles. This art had a major rivalry with Brazilian jiu-jitsu back in the day.
Euclydes even had a famous match where he defeated George Gracie in a catch-rules fight. There would continue to be a rivalry between BJJ and Luta Livre for decades.
Luta Livre was considered by many to be the poor man’s grappling art of Brazil since many of its practitioners could not afford a gi.
There were many well-known Vale Tudo matches between those who practiced BJJ and those who practiced Luta Livre over the years.
Ultimately, however, BJJ would emerge as the more popular grappling art in Brazil. That said, Luta Livre is still practiced to this day and produces some of the world’s best grapplers.
Since it came from catch wrestling Luta Livre was ahead of BJJ in some areas of grappling such as the leg lock game.
The Grandfather Art Of Folkstyle and Freestyle Wrestling
Catch wrestling is considered the parent art to both folkstyle and freestyle wrestling. However, when looking to introduce wrestling in high schools and colleges it only made sense to make the sport a bit safer.
The biggest differences between folkstyle wrestling and catch wrestling are the point system and the submissions.
In pure catch wrestling, the only way to win is either by pin or by submission. There are no points or other ways to win.
Folkstyle and freestyle wrestling did come from catch wrestling but they changed the rules and took out the submissions. Catch wrestling was in and out of some of the early modern Olympic games.
The only problem was that as rough as catch wrestling is, many people saw the sport as too violent. Some would even go on to compare it to dogfighting.
Because of this, they would modify the sport to make it more appealing to a larger audience.
This in turn gave birth to what we now know as freestyle wrestling. Though back then many referred to it as amateur catch as catch can wrestling. So really folkstyle and freestyle wrestling are rooted in catch wrestling.
That said, pure catch wrestling is more of a complete art if you ask me. After all, many of the modern critiques about wrestling are that it lacks submissions.
Little do they know that catch wrestling has had a great submission game before BJJ had even begun. Not to mention the fact that catch wrestling also has a very strong takedown game.
Catch Wrestling Vs BJJ
Catch wrestling and BJJ have more of a history than many people know. To truly understand this we first need to talk about the history between catch wrestling and judo.
The reason for this is that judo is the parent art of BJJ. The birth of BJJ came from the man Mitsuyo Maeda after his time in Brazil where he would teach the young Carlos Gracie his judo style.
One thing that many people do not know is that Mitsuyo Maeda also competed in catch wrestling tournaments at the beginning of the 20th century.
There was some cross-training between judokas and catch wrestlers that took place at this time. Mitsuyo Maeda certainly gave evidence that he adopted certain techniques from this Western grappling art.
Much of what he learned was carried over to Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Another famous judoka who cross-trained in catch wrestling would be none other than Masahiko Kimura.
This was the man who had the famous battle with Helio Gracie and would ultimately defeat him with what we call in BJJ the Kimora.
Of course, Masahiko Kimura would have known it as the double wrist lock. Many of the grappling styles of the world have more of a history together than many understand. BJJ players and catch wrestlers have a lot to learn from each other.
The only problem is that finding a qualified teacher in catch wrestling is hard to come by. You don’t really see a school on every other corner like you do BJJ in some parts of the world.
Catch Wrestling Submissions Vs BJJ Submissions
Though catch as catch can wrestling has strangles and chokes, most of the submissions taught today are painful submissions. These would include things like body locks, neck cranks, toe holds, and much more.
If BJJ is known as the gentle art then catch is known as the brutal art. There are some great submissions BJJ practitioners could learn and improve their game with.
However, be warned that you might not want to jump into a BJJ class and practice these on your classmates. That is without at least talking with them about it first.
Catch wrestlers often use painful techniques to submit and control their opponents. This might not go over too well with an unexpecting BJJ practitioner.
Not to say that you should not find a partner to learn some of the techniques with, just that they should know what they are in for. Otherwise, some of the submissions might cause you to lose a few friends.
How To Get Started In Catch Wrestling
As I said, finding a good school is hard to come by. Of course, it never hurts to at least see if there is a qualified instructor in your area. My hope is that it will continue to grow and we will see it become a bigger influence on the grappling scene.
In turn, I hope to see more schools open up or perhaps start to see classes offered at other grappling academies. There is so much to be learned from catch as catch can, especially for BJJ players.
If you live in a major city you probably have access to plenty of BJJ and MMA gyms to choose from. However, if you want to learn catch wrestling, you must be very lucky to live in the right area.
Some people who are very serious about learning real catch wrestling have even moved across states and even countries to learn this art from one of the few qualified instructors. So if you have not already, first take a look in your area and see what comes up.
If you find a place to learn consider yourself lucky. However, you might not want to get too excited until you look up some reviews and make sure it is a good place to train.
The community is small enough that you should be able to find out if the instructor is legit or not.
Learn Online
If you don’t have anyone to learn from in your area the next best thing would be to find a resource online. Of course, this could never replace learning in person but there is a good chance it is your only option.
You can find my top-rated catch wrestling instructionals here.
Of course, there are other resources as well such as YouTube and other free online resources. Either way, I do not doubt that diving into learning some of the great techniques from this art will certainly help your grappling game.
Catch Wrestling In MMA
Another area in which catch wrestling has excelled is MMA. Some of the greatest fighters came from a catch wrestling background including some former UFC champions. One of the most notable would be Kazushi Sakuraba AKA the Gracie Hunter.
There are a large handful of catch wrestlers who did well in MMA but Sakuraba was one of the first to showcase his art against BJJ fighters.
With BJJ on the rise, few people knew very much about catch wrestling. At the time BJJ was the only submission grappling art in MMA that was on most people’s radar.
The Gracie Hunter
Sakuraba shocked the world by defeating Royler Gracie via kimura lock ( double wrist lock in catch). This would be the first defeat of a Gracie since the start of the UFC. Soon after the Gracies would hope to avenge this defeat at the Pride 2000 Grand Prix.
A special ruleset would take place in this fight where the fighter must win through submission or knockout. There was no time limit and the results would not be left up to the judges.
After a grueling one-and-a-half-hour match, Rorion Gracie would throw in the towel for his brother. This was when he would get the nickname the Gracie Hunter.
The reason these fights were such a big deal was that Sakuraba was using catch wrestling to defeat BJJ in an MMA bout. This was one of the first times many people were able to see how this old-school submission grappling art would fair against BJJ.
This is not to indicate that it is superior to BJJ by any means but simply that it is also a reputable submission grappling art as well.
Is Catch Wrestling Here To Stay?
So what is the future of this amazing grappling art? Well if you ask me I believe that it will continue to grow in popularity.
This is especially true with the rise of competitive submission grappling. As more catch wrestlers start to compete in these competitions I believe it will start to receive more recognition.
I would love to see more catch wrestlers compete in no-gi grappling tournaments. People like Josh Barnett have proven its effectiveness by winning both the no-gi world championships as well as becoming the Metamoris heavyweight champion.
Keeping this amazing art alive certainly depends on this generation continuing to teach the art to future generations. It has a lot to offer the grappling world and I would hate to see go away.
Thankfully, however, I believe that it is here to stay. It is simply too effective of a grappling art to vanish anytime soon.
The real goal I believe should be to share the knowledge between all of the great grappling arts. This is in my opinion the true future of grappling sports.

Defending takedowns is an important part of wrestling. There are many different types of takedowns that your opponent might try against you. One very common shot is a high crotch. If your opponent gets in on a deep high crotch, you may not be able to get your hips back to counter with a sprawl. If that happens, you can defend the high crotch by sitting the corner. This is a very effective way to take away your opponent’s ability to transition a high crotch to a single or a double leg. It brings the wrestling down to the mat where you have the advantage.
In this video, two time NCAA champion and Olympian Ben Askren shows how to sit the corner and four ways to finish from the position.
First, when someone shoots in on a high crotch, you have to get their shoulder to outside of your hips. Watch how Askren pushes on his partner’s lat and does a circular sit down to the mat. Also notice the position of his free leg, it is bent not straight. Once down on the mat, you can lock your hands in the crotch, lock around the body, or you can pull the torso and leg into you without locking your hands. The important thing is you keep everything tight together.

The first and easiest finish from this position is to hook the ankle with your free leg and post on the mat with your hand so you can rotate your hips and end up with a leg ride and a takedown.
A second finish you can do from this position is to roll them over if they are driving into you. If you feel them really pressuring into you, post your free foot on the mat in between your legs and roll them over their top shoulder. After the roll, you should end up on top and they will most likely be holding onto the leg. You can do a couple things from this position. One thing Askren shows in the video is to lock up a near side cradle. If it is available, this is a great way to earn a pin. If the cradle is not available, slide your hips back and circle towards your opponent’s feet and cross face them to get the takedown.
A third way to finish in this position comes when they try to turn back into you once you have the leg hooked. Since the leg is hooked, they can’t get their foot back, so when they try to turn into you, it brings their head and knee close together and anytime the head and knee are close, it is cradle time.
There is another cradle you can hit from the sit the corner position. To set it up, you are going to lock your hands low on the leg and high on the body then drive him onto his shoulder. The hand that is on the body comes out and you slide it around the head to lock up the cradle. Once it is locked up, take him over to his back for the pin.
In this video, Askren shows this series when someone hits a high crotch, but this also works when someone shoots a single leg on you. You just have to push their head to the outside position first, then you can sit the corner.
As you can see, there are a lot of options from sitting the corner. Just remember to stay tight so they can’t run you over with their hips.

5 Essential Freestyle Wrestling Techniques for Beginners

So, let’s dive in and discover the key moves that will give you an edge on the wrestling mat.
Grip Techniques
Collar Tie
One of the fundamental grip techniques in freestyle wrestling is the collar tie. This grip involves grabbing the opponent’s collar with one hand while maintaining control over their head and neck. The collar tie allows you to control the distance between you and your opponent and sets the foundation for various offensive and defensive moves. It is important to maintain a firm grip on the collar to prevent your opponent from countering your attacks.
Double Wrist Control
Another essential grip technique for beginners in freestyle wrestling is the double wrist control. This grip involves grabbing both of your opponent’s wrists, allowing you to control their arms and limit their offensive options. By maintaining double wrist control, you can effectively neutralize your opponent’s attacks and set up your own offensive moves. It is crucial to maintain a strong grip on both wrists to prevent your opponent from breaking free.
Underhook
The underhook is a powerful grip technique that involves getting your arm underneath your opponent’s arm and around their back. This grip allows you to control your opponent’s upper body and set up various takedowns and throws. The underhook is particularly effective in close-quarters situations and can give you a significant advantage over your opponent. It is important to maintain a tight underhook grip and use it strategically to dictate the flow of the match.
By mastering these grip techniques – collar tie, double wrist control, and underhook – beginners in freestyle wrestling can develop a strong foundation for their technique and gain a competitive edge on the mat. Practice these grips diligently and focus on maintaining a strong grip to maximize your control over your opponent and execute effective offensive and defensive moves.

Practice these moves regularly, focusing on proper technique, timing, and maintaining control, and you’ll be well on your way to becoming a skilled wrestler.
Escapes and Reversals
In freestyle wrestling, having effective escape and reversal techniques is crucial for beginners who want to gain an advantage over their opponents. Escapes and reversals allow wrestlers to break free from a disadvantageous position and turn the tables in their favor. Here are three essential escapes and reversals that every beginner should learn:

The Peterson roll is a technique that allows you to reverse your opponent and gain control from the bottom position. It requires a combination of speed, technique, and timing. Here’s how you can execute a Peterson roll:
The Peterson roll is an advanced escape and reversal technique that may take time to master. However, once you’ve perfected it, it can become a valuable weapon in your wrestling arsenal.
By mastering these essential escapes and reversals, beginners in freestyle wrestling can become more confident in their ability to escape from difficult positions and turn the tide in their favor. Practice these techniques diligently to improve your overall wrestling skills and increase your chances of success on the mat.

The half nelson is a versatile technique that can be used to set up other pinning moves or to control your opponent’s movements during a match. It requires proper technique and timing to execute effectively, so beginners should practice it extensively before using it in a competitive setting.
Cradle
The cradle is another effective pinning technique that involves immobilizing your opponent by securing both their arms and head. It is a great move to use when you have gained control of your opponent’s upper body. Follow these steps to execute the cradle:
The cradle is a highly effective move for securing a pin, as it restricts your opponent’s movement and makes it difficult for them to escape. It requires coordination and strength to execute properly, so beginners should focus on mastering the technique before using it in live matches.
Armbar
The armbar is a pinning technique that focuses on controlling and immobilizing your opponent’s arm. It can be used to set up a pin or to create opportunities for other offensive moves. Follow these steps to execute the armbar:
The armbar is a versatile move that can be used from various positions, such as when your opponent is on their back or when you are in a top position. It requires proper technique and control to execute effectively, so beginners should practice it under the guidance of a coach or experienced wrestler.
Defense Techniques
Sprawl
One of the most crucial defensive techniques in freestyle wrestling is the sprawl. The sprawl is a technique used to defend against an opponent’s takedown attempt. It involves dropping the hips and sprawling the legs backward when the opponent shoots in for a takedown.
By performing a sprawl, a wrestler can avoid getting taken down and maintain a dominant position on the mat. This defensive move requires good timing and quick reflexes to anticipate the opponent’s takedown attempt and react swiftly.
Front Headlock
Another effective defense technique in freestyle wrestling is the front headlock. This technique involves controlling the opponent’s head and neck from the front while standing or on the ground.
When an opponent initiates an attack, the wrestler can quickly secure a front headlock position by wrapping their arm around the opponent’s neck and grabbing their own wrist. From this position, the wrestler can exert control over the opponent’s movements and prevent them from executing their techniques effectively.
The front headlock can be used to counter an opponent’s takedown attempt or to set up various offensive moves such as throws or chokes. It requires good leverage and upper body strength to maintain control over the opponent while defending against their attacks.
Whizzer
The whizzer is another essential defensive technique that wrestlers utilize to counter an opponent’s takedown attempt. This move involves using a well-timed hip and arm movement to disrupt the opponent’s attack and regain control of the match.
When an opponent tries to execute a takedown, the wrestler can counter by sprawling one leg back while driving their hip into the opponent’s side. Simultaneously, they can wrap their arm around the opponent’s arm or waist, creating a whizzer position. This helps in neutralizing the opponent’s attack and turning the situation to their advantage.
The whizzer can be used to launch a counter-attack, escape from a precarious position, or gain control over the opponent’s movements. It requires a combination of agility, timing, and technique to execute effectively and prevent the opponent from scoring points.
Mastering these defense techniques – the sprawl, front headlock, and whizzer – is crucial for beginners in freestyle wrestling. By honing these skills, wrestlers can effectively defend against their opponents’ attacks, maintain control on the mat, and create opportunities for their own offensive moves.
In conclusion, mastering the essential freestyle wrestling techniques is crucial for beginners who want to excel in the sport. By understanding the fundamentals of stance, takedowns, escapes, reversals, and pinning combinations, wrestlers can build a strong foundation for their future success. These techniques not only enhance their skills but also improve their overall physical fitness, discipline, and mental toughness. With consistent practice and dedication, beginners can develop their wrestling abilities and progress to higher levels in the sport. So, grab your wrestling gear, find a coach, and start learning and implementing these essential techniques to become a formidable force on the mat. Happy wrestling!

Do you have some questions about the Russian tie?
In this article, we’ll look at what the Russian tie is, how it’s performed, its history, as well as what a Russian tie snap is, how it’s performed, Russian tie takedowns, and more.
Contents
What Is the Russian Tie?
The Russian tie, also known as the two-on-one, is a technique used in wrestling to control an opponent’s arm.
The idea is to control one of the opponent’s arms with both arms, thereby limiting their offensive capabilities and setting up various offensive moves such as throws, takedowns, or transitions to other control positions.
In fact, for many practitioners, the purpose of the Russian tie is to drain the energy of the opponent as well as drain the clock – especially when they’re ahead on the scoreboard.
The Russian tie is achieved by gripping the opponent’s wrist with one hand and their upper arm with an underhook from the back and as close to the armpit as possible, effectively tying up that arm and limiting the opponent’s ability to attack or defend.
This grappling maneuver is a staple in freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, as well as in judo, sambo, submission wrestling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and mixed martial arts, albeit less commonly in the latter.
How To Do the Russian Tie
The Russian tie is a nuanced technique requiring a combination of grip strength, body positioning, and leverage.
Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you secure a Russian tie effectively:
1. Adopt a Proper Stance
Start in a solid wrestling stance with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and weight evenly distributed.
Keep your head up and your core engaged.
2. Initiate Contact
Engage with your opponent and look for an opportunity to control their leading arm. This often comes from a feint or when they reach out to grab you.
3. Secure the Wrist
With the hand closest to your opponent’s leading arm, firmly grasp their wrist.
Your grip should be strong and precise, preventing them from easily slipping away.
4. Establish the Underhook
Use your other hand to underhook your opponent’s arm as close to the armpit as possible.
The deeper the underhook, the more control you will have over their arm.
5. Clamp Down
Once you have the underhook, clamp your elbow down towards your own ribcage.
This secures their arm tightly to your body and gives you greater control.
6. Apply Pressure
Pull their wrist towards you while pushing the elbow up and in with your underhook.
This dual pressure not only off-balances your opponent but also prevents them from using that arm effectively.
7. Maintain Control
Keep your own body tight and compact.
Use your head to pressure their head, which adds another layer of control and can further off-balance them.
The opponent’s main defense will be to regain head control, so this position is vital.
8. Execute Follow-Up Techniques
With the Russian tie secured, you can now look for follow-up techniques such as takedowns, throws, or transitions to other holds, depending on your opponent’s reaction and your game plan.
9. Drill Consistently
Practice the Russian tie regularly with a partner, focusing on smooth transitions into the hold and follow-up techniques.
Consistent drilling will improve your muscle memory and execution under live conditions.
Note: Remember, the effectiveness of the Russian tie comes from your ability to control your opponent’s arm and use it to dictate the pace and flow of the match.
The closer you are to their armpit with your underhook, the more leverage you will have, making it a powerful tool in your wrestling arsenal.
For further clarification, here’s a superb video demonstrating how to do the Russian Tie:
Russian Tie Origin
The Russian tie, known for its strategic use of leverage and technique, is deeply rooted in the traditional wrestling styles of Russia and the former Soviet Union.
Originating from martial arts such as Khapsagay, Tatar Köräş, and Kurash, the Russian tie was distinctly refined and brought to the forefront of combat sports in the 20th century.
This period, particularly marked by the development of Soviet wrestling dominance and the establishment of sambo in the 1920s and 1930s, saw the technique gain international recognition and adoption.
As a fundamental component of the Soviet wrestling repertoire, the Russian tie was honed to perfection and showcased in international competitions, capturing the attention of the global martial arts community.
Its effectiveness in these arenas led to its incorporation into the emerging martial art of sambo, and more recently in judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and MMA.
Despite the adaptations made to fit the unique demands and regulations of each sport, the essence of the Russian tie – its emphasis on control and the economical use of force – has remained the same.
What Is the Russian Tie Snap?
After securing a Russian tie, a Russian Tie snap is a technique where the practitioner uses a snapping motion to aggressively pull the opponent’s arm down, across, and towards them.
The Russian tie snap is designed to off-balance the opponent quickly and create openings for attacks.
The snap can also be used to transition into other techniques or to force the opponent to the mat, where back control is often sought after.
Russian wrestler Aniuar Geduev is credited with coming up with the ankle pick and Russian tie snap tactic.
He uses the Russian tie snap to pull the opponent downward and the ankle pick to push them away, creating additional rotational force.
He effectively used it during his multiple gold medal successes at the European Wrestling Championships in 2013 and 2014, as well as during many other championships.
How To Do the Russian Tie Snap
Here’s how to do the Russian tie snap, step by step.
1. Establish Wrist Control
Begin by obtaining a firm grip on your opponent’s wrist. This grip is the anchor of your control and the pivot for the snap.
2. Create a Lower Body Threat
Threaten a low single-leg takedown or ankle pick on the leg opposite the wrist you’re controlling. If you have their right wrist, feint towards their left leg.
This threat should be convincing enough to make your opponent react defensively.
3. Shift Their Weight
As your opponent reacts to your lower body threat, they will instinctively shift their weight away from their feet and forward towards their hands to defend against the takedown.
This shift may cause them to balance on one foot, destabilizing their base momentarily.
This momentary imbalance is what you’re looking for to execute the snap.
4. Execute the Snap
With your opponent’s weight shifted forward and their base compromised, sharply and forcefully pull their wrist down and across their body to exploit their unstable position.
5. Take Advantage of the Fall
As your opponent falls forward or hits the ground, quickly take their back or transition to another dominant position.
Tips for Effectiveness
For further clarification, here’s a video showing UFC champion Islam Makhachev executing the perfect Russian tie snap, where he uses the tap distraction:
Russian Tie Takedowns
The Russian tie is a versatile grip that sets up a variety of takedowns, each exploiting the control and imbalance created by the two-on-one arm control.
Here are some common takedowns that can be executed from a Russian tie:
Russian Tie Snap: As previously described, this move involves snapping the opponent’s arm down and across their body to off-balance and bring them down to the mat, potentially allowing you to take their back.
Inside Trip: With control of the arm, you can step inside your opponent’s stance and use your leg to trip them over your own. This is often done by stepping in close to disrupt their balance before executing the trip.
Ankle Pick: From the Russian tie, you can lower your level and reach for the opponent’s far ankle, using the arm control to pull them forward as you pick the ankle to bring them down.
Arm Drag to Single or Double Leg: Using the Russian tie, you can perform an arm drag to expose your opponent’s side, allowing you to transition to a single or double leg takedown.
Throw-By: This technique involves using the Russian tie to pull and push the opponent’s arm by you, creating an opening to attack their back or set up further leg attacks.
High Crotch or Fireman’s Carry: With the opponent’s arm controlled, you can transition to a high crotch or fireman’s carry by dropping to your knees and lifting them off the ground, using the momentum to execute the takedown.

Heel Hook: Setups , Attacks, Defenses & Escapes
Apr 15, 2022
Table of Contents
The heel hook is a remarkable submission technique that is helpful in all sorts of grappling sports, including BJJ and MMA. This powerful technique has the potential to end a fight just like the knockout punches in boxing.
The use of heel hooks in BJJ has gone through many changes, the most recent being its re-emergence due to the efforts of the ultimate grappling duo: John Danaher and Eddie Bravo.
Today, the heel hook has become a necessity to succeed in no-gi ADCC competitions and Submission Wrestling. If you also want to take your jiu-jitsu game to the next level with this move, you have come to the right place!
This article breaks down every aspect of Heel Hook, including the best heel hook setup and attacks, the different ways to utilize this leg lock in your game, and methods to defend and escape from this deadly submission.
1. Heel Hook Set Ups
The heel hook is a leg lock submission that attacks the knee, foot, and ankle. It controls and isolates the knee in conjunction with the hips so that your opponent is unable to spin.
To perform a heel hook, first you need to form a leg entanglement in order to control your opponent’s legs and then apply rotational force to the heel to finish him/her off.
The heel hook is an extremely powerful move and it’s important that you learn the different setups in which you can use this move.
1.1. Heel Hook Set up From Half Guard
One of the setup in which you can use a heel hook is the half guard i.e. you’re lying on the top of your opponent with one of your opponent’s legs entangled. In this case, your opponent will be in half guard position while you will be in a half mount position.
If your competitor is going for a knee shield half guard, you have the advantage as his leg will already be bent.
Once in half guard, place your free knee on your opponent’s belly. Then fall back towards their heel and hold his heel by locking your grip.
If your opponent starts to defend by rolling, roll with him and finish the submission by twisting the foot.
1.2. Heel Hook Setup from Half Guard to Ashi Garami
Another setup to perform a heel hook is when you’re in a bottom half guard.
Start with a knee shield, placing the foot of your knee shield leg between your opponent’s legs.
Then reach over with both your arms and grab your opponent from behind his arm and knee (top hand: armpit, bottom hand: knee)
Use this grip to pull yourself underneath your opponent, move your top knee through to the other side and rotate into an Ashi Garami position.
To form the Ashi Garami position , rotate your body towards your opponent and push him away with both your top hand and knees. Pull his bottom leg with your free hand. Place your bottom foot on his hip (Ashi Garami position) and finish off with the heel hook.
1.3. Back Step to Heel Hook
Another great setup for heel hooks is to do a back step by faking a standing guard pass.
Start by taking control of your opponent’s head with one hand and grab his ankle with your other hand.
Then step your lead leg between your opponent’s legs and take a backstep with your back leg, placing your back leg outside of his other leg.
Finally, take your hand off your opponent’s head and grip under his knee. Slide in and hold their heel, finishing the move with a heel hook.
2. The Ultimate Heel Hook Attacks
2.1. Outside Heel Hook/Ashi Garame
One of the deadliest heel hook attacks in BJJ is the outside heel hook/ashi garami, illustrated by John Danaher in his outside heel hook master class.
This move makes use of the straight ashi garami in combination with the outside heel hook. The ashi garami acts as a control mechanism while the heel hook acts as a breaking mechanism.
2.2. Inside Heel Hook/Ashi Garame
Inside heel hook is one of the most formidable grappling attacks since it can destroy your opponent within seconds. The intrinsic nature of this move makes it an effective heel hook lock.
By twisting the heel, the attacker makes use of his strong back muscles against the opponent’s weak knee muscles. Due to its structural advantage, even beginners will be able to learn and implement this technique effectively.
2.3. Standing Heel Hook by Craig Jones
If you ever find yourself in a position where you don’t have enough time to pass, sweep or mount etc., A standing heel hook is the best option to beat your opponent.
This move is not only great for submission grappling tournaments but also for MMA and self-defense. Craig Jones is the master, able to pull off this interesting heel hook from a modified position.
To perform this attack, start by hooking your opponent’s leg above his knee with your legs off the ground. Then take an under hook and scoot toward the leg you’re controlling.
Then reach under your opponent to grab his foot and elevate him. Bring his bottom leg through, knees in, and tower over your opponent.
You will end up in a saddle position where you can finish the match with an inside or outside heel hook.
3. How to Defend & Escape the Heel Hook?
One of the most intimidating tasks in BJJ is to defend and escape heel hooks. Leg locks have gained popularity in recent times due to the “submission only tournaments” and more people have started to use them in No-Gi Competitions as well.
Most practitioners are afraid of heel hooks as they think that if they get caught in them, it will be too late to escape as their ligaments will likely already be damaged.
However, this is not true. There is plenty of time to tap without getting hurt after getting caught in a heel hook. The following are ways you can defend yourself without getting hurt.
3.1. Develop a Good Base and Posture
A good base and posture are useful in defending against heel hooks. In theory, it is not possible to finish the heel hook if you are standing with your foot still flat on the mat.
Having a good base and posture helps you to stop your competitor from sweeping you. Not getting swept is the first thing to do when dealing with troublesome heel hookers.
If you can develop a good posture and manage to keep an aggressive game, you will be able to defend against the heel hook effectively.
3.2. Do Hand Fighting
Another key element in defending against the heel hook is hand-to-hand fighting. Your opponent cannot finish the heel hook with only one hand and you can use this to your advantage.
Suppose that your opponent sweeps you even if you have a good base and posture, the first thing you should do is engage in hand-to-hand fight to achieve a 2 on 1 grip on your competitor’s wrist.
Taking hold of your opponent’s wrist is the key to survival when you’re already about to get heel hooked.
3.3. Clear the Knee Line
Once you have fallen and your opponent has started to attack with the heel hook, clearing your knee line can help you escape the attack quickly.
You must be able to clear the knee line, i.e. get your knee cap out from in between your opponent’s leg, for this tactic to work. If you’re about to get swept off your feet, try to fall in a controlled position where you can clear the knee line easily.
4. How to Escape Primary Heel Hook Positions?
There are three primary heel hook positions in which you will mostly find yourself entrapped during a match. Therefore, it is important to learn how to escape from these positions if you’re ever caught in such a situation.
The three primary heel hook positions are,
The position where your opponent extends your leg to perform the submission.
The position where your front leg is laced over your opponent’s leg and your back leg is placed behind his thigh
The position where your inside legs are interlaced with your opponent’s inside leg.
4.1. Escaping Ashi Garami Outside Heel Hook
To escape this heel hook position, you first need to identify the problem. You will notice that your body is tightly gripped by your opponent and need to escape his hold if you want to defend yourself.
To loosen your opponent’s grip, pull over his hands and hide your heel by turning it away simultaneously. You can also use your other foot to assist in the process if you’re facing any difficulties. Then, to prevent yourself from being controlled again, quickly step over your opponent’s hip.
Once you have escaped the heel hook, instead of running away, convert your defense into counter attack to win the match.
4.2. Escaping Honey Hole Heel Hook
To escape the mother of leg entanglements, i.e. the Honey Hole, you must have a lot of control. You need to hide your heel and get to your opposite hip to safely escape from this heel hook.
First, you need to separate your secondary leg by rotating your opponent’s arm inward. This will create enough space to allow you to free your leg. Make sure to keep this leg out of your opponent’s reach once it’s free so that he cannot regain control.
Then, to free your primary leg, you need to ensure that your knee is outside of the imaginary line connecting your hip and ankle.
Start by gripping at your opponent’s ankle. Then create a base and put weight on your primary leg. Place your foot on the mat such that your heel is facing upwards, free your knee line, and escape your opponent’s hold.
4.3. Escaping 50/50 Heel Hook
In the 50/50 position, you and your opponent are equally vulnerable to the hell hook. Whoever can hide his feet while effectively attacking the opponent’s feet will win in the end.
To escape from a 50/50 heel hook, you need to attack your competitor’s knee pinch and open his legs. This will allow you to shift your weight and pull your leg out of his grip.
5. Tips for Defending Heel Hook
Don’t be afraid of the heel hook and pay attention to the technique being used (inside or outside). Understanding the technique will help you learn what you need to do and enable you to plan your defense accordingly.
The key to defend from the heel hook is to prevent your leg from being pinned in the first place. No leg lock can be performed without having knee control. As soon as your knee clears the line of your competitor’s hip, you can relax and lean back.
If you end up being caught in a heel hook, instead of accepting the submission, take steps for damage control while keeping in mind the safety of your foot. Depending on the heel hook position, cross your feet, hide your foot under your opponent, or curl your leg, etc. The goal here is to make your opponent work hard for a grip, giving you enough time to defend against the heel hook
Once you’re in the grip and your opponent is going to put pressure on your leg, do not fidget to try and escape the entanglement. Instead, go hand-to-hand and get a 2 on 1 grip. The goal is to keep your opponent’s arm as far away from the foot as possible. Don’t forget to hide your feet while doing so.
If you feel that the pressure is becoming too painful for your leg, tap quickly without waiting for the opponent to finish the heel hook. While most martial artists think tapping out is bad, this is not the case. In fact, tapping out is a legitimate heel hook defense and is much better than walking around on crutches for months.

Mastering the Art of Takedowns in Freestyle Wrestling: A Comprehensive Guide
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling. If you are passionate about this dynamic combat sport and want to enhance your skills in taking down opponents, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we will delve into the essential techniques, strategies, and training drills that will empower you to dominate your opponents on the wrestling mat. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your takedown abilities, this guide is designed to provide you with valuable insights and expert advice to take your freestyle wrestling game to the next level.
Understanding the Basics of Takedowns
Takedowns are a fundamental aspect of freestyle wrestling. They involve swiftly and strategically taking down your opponent to gain control or score points. Understanding the basics of takedowns is crucial for any wrestler looking to excel in this dynamic sport.
Different Types of Takedowns
Single Leg Takedown: This is one of the most common takedown techniques used in freestyle wrestling. It involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs and swiftly driving them off balance to bring them down to the mat.
Double Leg Takedown: Similar to the single leg takedown, the double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent’s legs and using your body weight to knock them off balance and bring them down.
High Crotch Takedown: This takedown technique requires you to shoot in towards your opponent’s legs, driving your shoulder into their midsection. From there, you can lift and maneuver them to the ground.
Fireman’s Carry: The fireman’s carry is a more advanced takedown that involves throwing your opponent over your shoulder while maintaining control of their upper body. It requires good timing and technique but can be highly effective when executed correctly.
Strategies for Setting up Takedowns
Establishing Control: Before attempting a takedown, it’s essential to establish control over your opponent. This can be achieved through hand fighting, maintaining good posture, and creating angles to disrupt their balance.
Creating Openings: Look for opportunities to create openings for takedowns by feinting or faking attacks. This can force your opponent to react, opening up opportunities for you to execute a takedown.
Using Combinations: Utilize combinations of attacks to keep your opponent guessing and off balance. By chaining together different takedown attempts, you can increase your chances of successfully executing a takedown.
Key Techniques for Executing Takedowns
Level Change: A crucial aspect of executing a successful takedown is the ability to change levels. This involves lowering your body position while maintaining good posture, making it harder for your opponent to defend against your takedown attempts.
Explosiveness and Speed: Takedowns require explosive and quick movements. By training your explosiveness and speed through drills and exercises, you can enhance your ability to execute takedowns effectively.
Maintaining Balance: It’s important to maintain your own balance throughout the takedown process. This allows you to stay in control and quickly transition to other techniques if necessary.
Finishing the Takedown: Once you have initiated a takedown, focus on finishing it strong. This involves driving through your opponent, using your entire body to maintain control, and securing a dominant position on the mat.
Mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling takes time, practice, and a deep understanding of the basics. By familiarizing yourself with different types of takedowns, employing effective strategies, and honing key techniques, you can elevate your takedown game and become a formidable force on the wrestling mat.
Developing Strength and Conditioning
In order to excel in freestyle wrestling and master the art of takedowns, it is crucial to focus on developing strength and conditioning. This aspect of training plays a vital role in enhancing performance on the mat. By incorporating specific exercises for building core strength, cardiovascular training for endurance, and emphasizing the importance of flexibility and agility, wrestlers can greatly improve their overall abilities.
Specific Exercises for Building Core Strength
Core strength is fundamental in freestyle wrestling as it provides stability and power for executing takedowns effectively. Incorporating specific exercises targeting the core muscles can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. Some effective exercises for building core strength include:
Plank: The plank is a simple yet highly effective exercise for strengthening the core. Start by assuming a push-up position and then lower your forearms to the ground. Hold this position while maintaining a straight line from your head to your feet. Aim to gradually increase the duration of the hold as your core strength improves.
Russian Twists: This exercise targets the oblique muscles, which are crucial for generating rotational power during takedowns. Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly, keeping your back straight. Hold a weight or medicine ball in front of your chest and twist your torso from side to side, touching the weight or ball to the ground on each side.
Leg Raises: Leg raises help strengthen the lower abdominal muscles, which are essential for explosive movements in wrestling. Lie on your back with your legs straight and your hands by your sides. Lift your legs off the ground while keeping them straight, and then slowly lower them back down without touching the ground. Repeat for multiple sets.
Cardiovascular Training for Endurance
Endurance is another crucial aspect of freestyle wrestling, as matches can be physically demanding and often require sustained effort. Incorporating cardiovascular training into your routine can greatly improve your endurance levels. Here are some effective cardiovascular exercises for wrestlers:
Running: Running is a great cardiovascular exercise that helps build endurance and stamina. Incorporate both steady-state running for longer durations and interval training to simulate the intensity of wrestling matches. Interval training involves alternating between high-intensity sprints and recovery periods.
Cycling: Cycling is a low-impact cardiovascular exercise that can be beneficial for wrestlers. Whether you prefer indoor cycling or hitting the roads, it provides an excellent way to improve your endurance. Vary the intensity of your rides by incorporating intervals or incorporating hill climbs to simulate the demands of wrestling.
Jumping Rope: Jumping rope is not only a great warm-up exercise but also an effective way to improve cardiovascular fitness. It is a high-intensity exercise that engages multiple muscle groups and helps improve coordination and footwork.
Importance of Flexibility and Agility
Flexibility and agility are key components of successful takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Being able to move swiftly and fluidly while maintaining balance is crucial for executing techniques effectively. Here are some important aspects to consider:
Dynamic Stretching: Incorporate dynamic stretching exercises into your warm-up routine before training or competing. Dynamic stretching involves continuous movement through a full range of motion and helps improve flexibility and joint mobility. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, and torso twists.
Plyometric Exercises: Plyometric exercises, such as box jumps or lateral bounds, help improve agility and explosive power. These exercises involve quick and powerful movements that enhance muscle elasticity and coordination.
Yoga or Pilates: Engaging in regular yoga or Pilates sessions can greatly improve flexibility, balance, and body control. These practices also promote core strength and stability, which are essential for executing takedowns with precision.
By incorporating these exercises and emphasizing the importance of strength and conditioning, core strength, cardiovascular training, flexibility, and agility, wrestlers can enhance their performance in freestyle wrestling and ultimately master the art of takedowns. Remember, consistent practice and dedication are key to achieving success in any sport.
Mastering the Mechanics of Takedowns
Proper Stance and Balance
In the world of freestyle wrestling, having a proper stance and balance is crucial to mastering the art of takedowns. Your stance determines your readiness and stability while engaging with your opponent. Here are some key points to remember:
Gripping and Controlling Techniques
Once you have established a solid stance, the gripping and controlling techniques play a vital role in executing successful takedowns. Here’s what you need to know:
Footwork and Timing
Apart from having a strong stance and effective gripping techniques, footwork and timing are essential components of mastering takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Consider the following factors:
By understanding and practicing the mechanics of takedowns, focusing on proper stance and balance, gripping and controlling techniques, as well as footwork and timing, you can elevate your freestyle wrestling skills to new heights. Mastering these fundamental aspects will greatly enhance your ability to execute effective takedowns and gain a competitive edge in the sport.
Countering and Defending Against Takedowns
Recognizing and Reacting to Opponent’s Attacks
In freestyle wrestling, the ability to recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks is crucial when countering and defending against takedowns. Being able to anticipate your opponent’s movements and understand their preferred techniques will give you a significant advantage in defending against their attacks.
To effectively recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks, it is essential to develop a keen sense of observation. Pay close attention to their footwork, body positioning, and any subtle cues that may indicate an impending takedown attempt. By studying your opponent’s patterns and tendencies, you can better prepare yourself to counter their attacks.
Quick reflexes and agility are key when reacting to your opponent’s attacks. As soon as you perceive an incoming takedown attempt, you must swiftly adjust your stance and position yourself to neutralize their attack. Maintaining a low center of gravity and keeping your balance will make it harder for your opponent to execute a successful takedown.
Effective Counter Techniques
Having a repertoire of effective counter techniques will greatly enhance your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are a few techniques that can be utilized to counter your opponent’s attacks:
Sprawl: The sprawl technique involves quickly extending your legs backward while dropping your hips to the mat. By doing so, you create a wider base and make it difficult for your opponent to secure a takedown.
Whizzer: The whizzer, also known as an overhook, is a defensive move where you use your arm to control your opponent’s attacking arm. This technique allows you to redirect their momentum and potentially gain an advantageous position.
Front Headlock: When your opponent attempts a takedown, you can react by securing a front headlock. This move involves wrapping your arms around your opponent’s head and controlling their upper body, preventing them from completing the takedown.
Granby Roll: The granby roll is an effective technique to counter a takedown and quickly regain control. It involves rolling away from your opponent’s attack while using your momentum to reverse the situation.
Defensive Strategies and Tactics
In addition to individual counter techniques, implementing defensive strategies and tactics can greatly improve your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are some defensive strategies to consider:
Maintain a Strong Base: By keeping a strong and balanced stance, you make it more challenging for your opponent to take you down. Focus on keeping your feet shoulder-width apart and distributing your weight evenly.
Hand Fighting: Engaging in hand fighting with your opponent can disrupt their attempts to initiate takedowns. By controlling their hands and wrists, you limit their ability to secure a successful takedown.
Circle and Angle: Instead of standing directly in front of your opponent, use circular footwork and angles to make it harder for them to shoot for a takedown. Constantly moving and changing angles forces your opponent to adjust and can create openings for counters.
Utilize Defensive Drills: Incorporate defensive drills into your training routine to improve your reflexes, timing, and defensive instincts. Practice scenarios where your opponent attempts takedowns, and focus on reacting quickly and effectively countering their attacks.
By recognizing and reacting to your opponent’s attacks, utilizing effective counter techniques, and implementing defensive strategies, you will enhance your ability to counter and defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Constant practice and refinement of these skills will lead to mastery and success on the wrestling mat.
Strategies for Competition
Creating an Effective Game Plan
Having a well-defined game plan is crucial in freestyle wrestling competitions. It allows wrestlers to approach matches with a strategic mindset, maximizing their chances of success. Here are some key steps to creating an effective game plan:
Study your opponent: Before the match, research and analyze your opponent’s previous performances. Look for patterns, strengths, and weaknesses that can be exploited during the bout. This information will help you develop a targeted strategy.
Identify your strengths: Assess your own wrestling style and identify your strongest techniques and moves. Build your game plan around these strengths to capitalize on your skills during the match.
Set specific objectives: Determine specific goals and objectives for the match. These could include scoring a certain number of takedowns, avoiding specific moves from your opponent, or dominating a particular position. Having clear objectives will keep you focused and motivated during the competition.
Practice your strategy: Once you have identified your game plan, practice it extensively during training sessions. Work on executing your chosen techniques and movements flawlessly to build muscle memory and confidence.
Analyzing and Exploiting Opponent’s Weaknesses
One of the most effective strategies in freestyle wrestling is identifying and exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses. By studying their previous matches and observing their style, you can develop a game plan that targets their vulnerabilities. Here’s how to go about it:
Watch their matches: Analyze your opponent’s previous matches to identify any recurring weaknesses or areas where they struggle. Pay attention to their reactions in different situations and take note of any recurring mistakes they make.
Identify common weaknesses: Once you have observed your opponent’s matches, look for common weaknesses that can be exploited. These could be technical flaws, predictable reactions, or vulnerabilities in certain positions. Understanding these weaknesses will help you plan your attacks accordingly.
Develop counter strategies: Based on the weaknesses you have identified, develop specific counter strategies. Practice techniques and moves that directly exploit your opponent’s vulnerabilities, allowing you to gain an advantage during the match.
Stay adaptable: While it is important to exploit your opponent’s weaknesses, it is equally crucial to adapt your strategy during the match. If your initial plan doesn’t yield the desired results, be prepared to make quick adjustments and capitalize on any new openings that arise.
Mental Preparation for Matches
Mental preparation plays a vital role in freestyle wrestling competitions. It helps wrestlers stay focused, confident, and resilient throughout the match. Here are some key aspects of mental preparation that can enhance your performance:
Visualization techniques: Before the match, spend time visualizing yourself executing your game plan flawlessly. Imagine each move, takedown, and counter in vivid detail. This mental rehearsal helps build confidence and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenges.
Positive self-talk: Replace negative thoughts and self-doubt with positive affirmations. Remind yourself of your strengths, skills, and previous successes. Repeat empowering phrases to boost your confidence and maintain a positive mindset.
Controlled breathing: Deep, controlled breathing techniques can help calm your nerves and reduce anxiety before and during the match. Practice rhythmic breathing exercises to center yourself and stay focused on the present moment.
Develop a pre-match routine: Establish a consistent pre-match routine that helps you get in the right mindset. This routine could include warm-up exercises, visualization sessions, or listening to motivational music. Having a routine creates a sense of familiarity and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenge.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of physical prowess and mental acuity. By strategizing effectively, exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses, and mentally preparing for matches, you can significantly enhance your performance on the mat.
Drills and Training Exercises
Partner Drills for Takedown Practice
One of the most effective ways to improve your takedown skills in freestyle wrestling is through partner drills. These drills allow you to practice your techniques in a controlled setting with a training partner. Here are some partner drills that can help you master the art of takedowns:
Double Leg Takedown Drill: Start by facing your partner in a wrestling stance. Initiate the drill by shooting in for a double leg takedown. Your partner should sprawl and defend while you focus on driving through and completing the takedown. Repeat this drill multiple times, alternating roles with your partner.
Single Leg Takedown Drill: Similar to the double leg takedown drill, this drill focuses on executing a single leg takedown. Begin by gripping your partner’s collar tie or wrist control, then quickly transition to a single leg attack. Your partner should defend by sprawling and countering. Practice this drill with both partners taking turns as the attacker and defender.
Hand Fighting Drill: Hand fighting is crucial for setting up takedowns and gaining control over your opponent. In this drill, focus on developing your hand fighting skills by engaging in controlled sparring with your partner. Work on establishing dominant grips, clearing ties, and creating openings for takedowns. Remember to maintain proper technique and intensity throughout the drill.
Solo Drills for Technique Refinement
In addition to partner drills, solo drills are essential for refining your takedown techniques and improving your overall performance in freestyle wrestling. These drills allow you to focus on specific movements and body mechanics without the need for a training partner. Here are some solo drills that can help you enhance your takedown skills:
Shadow Wrestling: Shadow wrestling involves simulating takedowns and defensive movements without a partner. Stand in front of a mirror or an imaginary opponent and practice your takedown techniques. Focus on proper footwork, hip movement, and penetration steps. Visualize your opponent’s reactions and work on your timing and precision.
Shot Drills: Shot drills are designed to improve your speed, explosiveness, and precision when shooting for takedowns. Set up a series of cones or markers on the ground, and practice shooting from various distances. Start slowly, focusing on proper form, and gradually increase your speed and intensity. Challenge yourself by incorporating level changes and fakes into your shots.
Resistance Band Drills: Resistance bands can be a valuable tool for developing strength and power in your takedown movements. Attach a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point and work on your takedown motions against the resistance. This will help you build explosive power and improve your ability to finish takedowns against tough opponents.
Live Wrestling and Scrimmage Sessions
While drills and solo exercises are essential for skill development, nothing can replicate the intensity and unpredictability of live wrestling. Engaging in live wrestling sessions and scrimmages is crucial for applying your techniques in real-time situations. Here are some tips for making the most of live wrestling sessions:
Focus on Applying Techniques: Use live wrestling sessions as an opportunity to practice the takedowns you’ve been drilling. Focus on executing your techniques against resisting opponents and adapting to their reactions. Pay attention to your positioning, timing, and setups during live situations.
Experiment and Learn: Live wrestling sessions provide a platform for experimentation and learning. Don’t be afraid to try new techniques or variations of existing ones. Take risks, analyze the outcomes, and learn from both successful and unsuccessful attempts. This will help you expand your arsenal of takedowns and develop a well-rounded skillset.
Seek Feedback and Spar with Different Partners: During live wrestling sessions, actively seek feedback from coaches, teammates, or more experienced wrestlers. They can provide valuable insights into your takedown techniques, positioning, and overall performance. Additionally, try to wrestle with a variety of partners to expose yourself to different styles and challenges.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires consistent practice, dedication, and a willingness to learn from both successes and failures. By incorporating partner drills, solo exercises, and live wrestling sessions into your training routine, you can significantly improve your takedown skills and become a formidable competitor in the sport.
In conclusion, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of technique, strength, and strategy. It is essential to understand the fundamentals of positioning, footwork, and timing to successfully execute takedowns. Additionally, building strength and endurance through regular training and conditioning is crucial for maintaining control and overpowering opponents. Moreover, having a strategic approach, such as setting up takedowns with feints or capitalizing on an opponent’s weaknesses, can greatly increase the chances of success. By continuously honing these skills and incorporating them into one’s training regimen, wrestlers can elevate their performance and become formidable competitors in the sport of freestyle wrestling.

Once you've successfully sprawled out of the position, you have a few techniques you can go for from there, like a front headlock or ankle sweep. 5) Snap-Down.","10 Wrestling Moves And Techniques You Should Master
Wrestling is one of the most popular martial arts worldwide, and it’s been around as far back as 3000 BC. It’s a grappling-based martial art that focuses on putting your opponent on the ground, controlling their body, and pinning them.
Wrestling is also an effective martial art for self-defense, and many view it as one of the best bases for mixed martial arts – the most permissive combat sport in the world that allows many of the techniques you might have to deal with in self-defense situations.
There are countless techniques used in wrestling, with some being more effective than others. This article will examine some of the most effective wrestling moves and techniques you should master. Many of these techniques carry over to other grappling-based martial arts like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and Judo.
Ten Wrestling Moves You Should Master
Ready to improve your wrestling skills? Let’s dive right into our list of techniques you should master:
1) The Penetration Step
The penetration step is the foundation for many takedowns used in wrestling like the single and double leg takedown. The technique is performed to put you in a position to grab onto your opponent and take them to the canvas.
Any competent wrestling school gets their students to drill this technique regularly unless the rules of the specific wrestling style forbid takedowns that target the leg, as is the case with Greco-Roman wrestling.
Practice the penetration step often until it becomes part of your muscle memory so you can execute the technique smoothly and quickly. The technique starts in your stance with your lead leg slightly in front of your rear foot and your torso a little bit bent at your hips.
Here’s how to perform the penetration step:
2) The Single-Leg Takedown
The single-leg takedown is one of the most commonly used techniques in wrestling, and that’s because it’s highly effective. There are several variations of the single-leg takedown, but they all involve targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and dragging them to the ground. There’s also the high crotch – commonly known as the hi-C single-leg technique that involves targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and using the hold to pick them off the ground and throw them to the floor.
The high single-leg takedown is the easiest type of single-leg attack to learn since you don’t need to perform a penetration step before shooting in on your opponent’s leg
Here’s how to perform a conventional high single-leg takedown:
Here’s how to complete a conventional single-leg takedown
Figure out which single-leg attacks work best for you and incorporate them into your wrestling game. These techniques are highly effective in wrestling settings and other grappling arts like BJJ.
3) Double-Leg Takedown
Double-leg takedowns are another popular technique used in wrestling. It’s a more interesting technique than the single leg, as it involves rapidly changing levels and exploding forward into your opponent. There are many ways to set up double-leg takedowns, like head snaps, hand ties, and misdirection.
These techniques are more effective when you catch your opponent with both legs close to each other, allowing you to wrap and lock your arms around them.
Shooting in is the building block for many wrestling takedowns, including double-leg techniques. Drill it frequently when you train to make your takedowns more effective. The faster and smoother your penetration step is, the more likely you’ll be able to complete takedowns when you shoot for them.
Here’s how to perform a double-leg takedown:
4) Sprawl
Sprawling is one of the fundamental defensive techniques used in wrestling, and it’s effective at all levels. Takedowns like the single leg and double leg involve wrapping your legs around your opponent’s legs to complete, but sprawling moves your legs out of your opponent’s legs and forces them to carry your weight. Your hand, head, and hips are your first line of defense against takedowns and holds, but you can always sprawl when all that fails.
Here’s how to perform a proper sprawl:
5) Snap-Down
The snap-down is a simple technique that puts you in the top turtle position. The best time to go for it is when your opponent is hunched over as they try to defend against incoming attacks. At that point, there’s nothing to stop their forward posture from crashing.
It’s a popular technique with freestyle wrestlers. Grapplers from other grappling styles, like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, are equally fond of it.
Here are the mechanics of the snap-down:
Besides being a simple way to end up in the top turtle position, snap-downs also open up your takedowns since both techniques require your opponent to do opposing things to defend against them. Your opponent needs to move their legs away from you to defend against takedowns which opens them up to the snap-down. Conversely, your opponent must pull their torso backward to defend against the snap down, leaving them vulnerable to takedown attempts.
6) Whizzer
The whizzer is another effective defensive move that all wrestlers should master. When you’re not in a position to sprawl out of a takedown attempt, the whizzer is your next line of defense. The technique involves securing a deep overhook on your opponent’s nearest hand as they try to complete a takedown.
Securing a whizzer puts lots of pressure on your opponent’s shoulder, and that’s often enough to discourage them from completing takedowns. You can also use the whizzer to drive your opponent to the ground in a half-nelson by wrapping your free hand around their neck, or you can execute a hip toss.
7) Switch
The switch is one of the fundamental techniques used to reverse disadvantageous positions in wrestling. A completed switch puts you in a dominant position or gets you back to your feet. Unlike escapes which only earn you a point in a wrestling match, reversals like the switch get you two points.
Here’s how to perform the technique:
8) Sit-Out
The sit-out is another fundamental defensive technique you can use to escape from bottom positions. At times, you can also use the technique to drag your opponent to the bottom.
Here’s what the mechanics look like:
9) Front-Quarter Nelson
The front-quarter nelson is a handy wrestling technique that carries over into other grappling arts. It’s an effective way to transition to a dominant position after stuffing an opponent’s takedown attempt with a sprawl.
To perform a front-quarter nelson:
10)  Chicken Wing (Armbar)
The chicken wing is one of the most uncomfortable things you can do to your opponent from top position. It’s also one of the most reliable holds for wearing down opponents and pinning them. Also known as the armbar in wrestling, the chicken wing gives your multiple options once you’ve secured the hold.
Here’s what the technique looks like:

7 Tactics for Breaking Opponents & Winning Tough Matches
1) Opponent Stands Up From Bottom.
Do: Lift and Return
Don’t: Pull them on top of you, Release easily or drop to legs and hold on.
The Lift-n-Return is one of the prettiest moves in wrestling. You know you’re watching a tough wrestler when they relentless lift and return from the top. If you want to let your opponent go and they stand up on you, I suggest you lift-n-return and then release. Be sure they know they didn’t earn the point… You gave it to them.
2) Top position
Do: Keep constant forward pressure while working for breakdowns and turns.
Don’t: Try to hang on or float on top of your opponent
The best rides are all executed with toes dug in the mat and grinding pressure. Even if you don’t get the turn your goal is to let them know who is in charge and get inside their head when you’re on top. MANY close matches are won by not letting your opponent out from bottom or wearing them out with a tough grinding ride.
3) Bottom Position
Do: Relentlessly get to your feet and know solid leg defense.
Don’t: Roll around and rely on trick moves.
Stand ups won’t always work, but they will often create the action that is needed to get away from tougher opponents.
4) Solid Shot Defense
Do: Square hips, toe down on the feet and look to clear leg(s) to Front Headlocks
Don’t: Give away angles, sit to your butt or let them lift you.
Ideally, nobody should get to your legs but the fact is it is going to happen. Give your opponent as little as possible and look to score off their leg attacks. Train yourself to use the most fundamental shot defense techniques and you won’t give up as many takedowns and you will save yourself from injury.
5) Never watch the clock
Do: Listen to your coach for updates and train yourself to wrestle hard until you hear the whistle
Don’t: Never look to the clock in a close match during any action.
Train yourself to wrestle harder at the end of periods no matter what the score is.
6) Last 20 seconds of every period
Do: Win these short goes or at least break even
Don’t: Never lose the last 20 seconds
Get the take down, escape or reversal when in the neutral or bottom position. Keep your opponent down or develop a safe & reliable quick turn to score with when on top. Never, get taken down or let an opponent escape or reverse you in the last 20 seconds of a period.
7) On the leg(s) from a shot
Do: Get to your feet and finish, escape the weight and finish or clear out.
Don’t: Drop to your haunches, hold on or stand still on your feet.
Ideally, a wrestler will maintain continuous motion from set up to shot through the finish. But realistically many wrestlers get caught under their opponents and they need a strategy to deal with this.
If you follow these rules all the time, no matter what the score is, you will learn to wrestle to dominate. Being relentless with your attacks and extremely stingy are the keys to wrestling success. Master these positions and scenarios and find yourself winning a lot more close matches and feeling opponents break as the match goes on.

Wrestling Moves from Neutral:
Wrestling Neutral refers to the starting position in wrestling, where both wrestlers are standing and facing each other. From neutral, wrestlers can use breakdown moves to take their opponent down to the mat and gain control of the match.

These moves require the wrestler to use their speed and technique to take their opponent down to the mat.
Wrestling Techniques:
In addition to takedowns, there are a variety of other wrestling techniques that can be used as breakdown moves. These include throws, trips, and sweeps. Throws, such as the lateral drop or the hip toss, involve using an opponent's momentum against them to take them down to the mat. Trips, such as the ankle pick or the inside trip, involve using the wrestler's leg to trip their opponent and take them down. Sweeps, such as the Russian tie or the arm drag, involve using the wrestler's upper body to take their opponent off balance and take them down.
Best Wrestling Finishers:
In wrestling, a wrestling finisher is a move that is used to secure a win in a match. While there are many different finishers, some of the most common include the pin, the tech fall, and the major decision. A pin occurs when one wrestler is able to hold their opponent's shoulders to the mat for a certain period of time, while a tech fall occurs when one wrestler has a lead of 15 points or more over their opponent. A major decision occurs when one wrestler wins by at least 8 points.
Wrestling Stance:
A wrestler's stance is critical to their success in executing breakdown moves. A strong stance allows the wrestler to maintain their balance and generate power in their movements. The most common stance in wrestling is the neutral stance, where the wrestler keeps their feet shoulder-width apart and their weight evenly distributed. From this position, wrestlers can execute takedowns and other breakdown moves.In conclusion, breakdown moves are an essential part of a wrestler's arsenal. From tilts to takedowns, throws to trips, there are a variety of techniques that can be used to take an opponent down to the mat and gain control of the match.

Arm Wrestling Techniques (Demonstrated & Explained)
Harvey Meale
June 18, 2023
In the sport of armwrestling, there’s a hundreds different ways you can skin a cat, but we can simplify the various techniques into 2 categories: inside and outside armwrestling.
.
Inside armwrestling techniques include the hook and the press, whereas outside armwrestling refers to the top roll (and its variations).
Each technique is very different yet all of them can be effective ways to win an armwrestling match.
In this article we’ll run through each of the main techniques, compare their strengths and weaknesses, and help you decide which approach is right for you.
Let’s begin!
Inside vs. Outside Arm Wrestling
As mentioned earlier, there’s basically two approaches to armwrestling: inside and outside.
Think of these as the 2 major categories that contain each of the individual techniques we’re about to unpack.
Let’s first start with inside armwrestling.
Inside Arm Wrestling Techniques: Hook & Press
Inside armwrestling is all about coming forward and getting behind your shoulder.
The inside school of armwrestling generally requires more absolute strength and also utilizes more of your frame, bone structure, and connective tissue to get the job done.
Let’s take a look at the two major inside techniques.
Hook
The hook is an inside technique that involves cupping your opponent in towards you and getting behind your shoulder to use your frame and/or bicep to overpower your opponent.
It’s called the hook because you’re essentially creating a hook with your arm.
As with anything in armwrestling, there’s plenty of different ways you can execute the hook: there’s offensive and defensive hooks, the high hook, and within each of those there’s more than 1 way to go about pulling it off.
Some hookers pull using a ton of muscular (bicep) strength whereas others position themselves to use more of their frame and bone structure.
The hook really lends itself to athletes who have a ton of overall upper body strength, and we tend to see pullers with slightly shorter forearms gravitating towards this technique.
Shorter forearms generally allow you to produce more force which, when you’re already really strong, can often be enough to completely overpower your opponent.
Press
The press is another inside armwrestling technique which requires much more shoulder commitment, tricep/chest strength, and chopping strength (down pressure).
The idea of this move is to get your body behind your arm and essentially shoulder press your opponent to the pad.
The flop wrist press (sometimes called the dead wrist press) is a particular type of press which requires sacrificing your wrist in order to fully commit yourself to the press.
The press is a fantastic move for anyone who is stronger in pushing movements (i.e. bench press) as opposed to pulling (chin ups)
This is why we’ll often see powerlifters who enter the sport of armwrestling gravitating towards the inside style with a focus on the press.
Although the press can be an entire strategy from the word go, it can also be used as a finishing move you can transition to from the top roll or hook.
The press can put a bunch of stress on your elbow tendons and can cause injury if you aren’t able to pull it off, so be extremely cautious doing this as a beginner!
Outside Arm Wrestling Technique: Top Roll
Moving over now to the outside school of armwrestling we have the top roll and its many variations.
And yes, outside armwrestling can indeed be done indoors!
Outside armwrestling is all about attacking your opponent’s hand and fingers and establishing height.
In armwrestling, height = leverage.
The top roll is also all about pulling your opponent towards you and less about driving sideways towards the pad.
Outside armwrestlers seek to win the match through establishing a biomechanical leverage advantage, which will oftentimes enable slightly weaker armwrestlers to defeat stronger opponents.
Devon Larratt is a great example of this.
When he competes against super heavyweights, he’s almost always the weaker of the 2 armwrestlers, but if he’s able to get enough height and can avoid getting pinned within the first few seconds, he’s usually going to win the match.
The longer an armwrestling match goes, the more of an advantage the outside armwrestler will usually have as they’re constantly looking to extend their leverage advantage.
Top rollers rely a lot more on rising strength, pronation, and back pressure to win than hookers do.
Low Hand Top Roll
The low hand top roll is characterized by taking a slightly lower grip on your opponent’s thumb than you would a typical top (full hand) top roll.
The goal with this move is to cup in aggressively, drag through your lats, and pronate through your wrist, attacking the bottom 2 fingers of your opponent.
Instead of rising aggressively and trying to climb over your opponent’s first two fingers, we’re targeting much lower on the hand with this move.
The low hand top roll works particularly well against the hook and 1 of the best ways to counter a low hand top roll is with a posting top roll.
Posting Top Roll
The posting top roll is all about height.
You want to get your forearm as vertical as possible in the setup with your wrist as close to directly above your elbow as possible.
We call this ‘posting’ because your arm is almost upright, like a post sticking out of the ground.
Your knuckles should also be pointing towards the roof while setting up for a posting top roll.
The posting top roll is a great counter to a low hand top roll, but it doesn’t do quite as well vs. a hook as the low hand top roll does.
Open Top Roll
The open top roll (or open arm top roll as it’s sometimes referred to as) is what we’d refer to as a defensive style top roll.
It’s characterized by an elbow angle of more than 90 degrees, requires tons of bicep strength, and extreme amounts of pronation.
This move often looks quite similar to the king’s move, although there are differences.
King’s Move
The king’s move is where you ‘fight from under the table’, so to speak.
Your arm is usually very open (like in an open top roll), and oftentimes almost completely straight.
The main difference between the king’s move and an open top roll is that the upper arm (humerus) also rotates inwards, allowing you to pronate even further.
This causes the puller to effectively be on the side of their elbow.
The king’s move is almost impossible to pin because that rotation of your upper arm creates an absurd amount of pronation, but also because the tension shifts from your musculature to your bone structure, which is far more efficient.
This is one of the most dangerous techniques in the sport of armwrestling and should definitely be avoided by beginners!
Should You Learn Both Techniques?
When you’re new to the sport, you should definitely experiment with both the hook and the top roll just to get an idea of which one feels better to you.
But the vast majority of the time you’ll want to ‘pick a team’, so to speak, and focus on developing one technique to be your weapon of choice.
So play around with both inside and outside pulling initially, but aim to figure out where you want to spend most of your time.
If you’re unsure which technique to choose, go for the top roll as it’s easier to learn and will teach you more about technical armwrestling.
Which Technique Should You Choose?
There’s a number of factors that influence which technique you should choose to focus on, and many pullers will be genetically better suited to a certain style.
Height & Forearm Length
Taller pullers with longer arms are typically better suited to the outside/top roll technique, as they’re naturally able to generate more height, which is key to the top roll.
Strength Background
Anyone who excels in ‘pushing’ movements more so than they do pulling movements, will often be suited to the inside style of armwrestling.
If you’re coming from a powerlifting/bench press background or happen to have really strong triceps, the hook/press might be for you.
Perhaps you were once a shot putter and you’re already absurdly strong, you might be really well suited to inside armwrestling.
For pretty much everyone else, outside armwrestling will probably be the way to go, but it’s extremely individualistic so you’ve got to play around with it to see what feels right for you.
Which Technique Is Better?
Remarkably, no one technique has a massive advantage against another – otherwise everyone would be doing the same thing.
So it really doesn’t matter too much which technique you end up focusing on, so long as you put the time and effort into developing it.

What Muscles Are Used In Arm Wrestling? (Not Just Biceps!)
Arm wrestling is a popular sport and pastime that has a long and colorful history, dating back centuries. While it may not have the same level of recognition as more mainstream sports, arm wrestling has a dedicated following and a rich tradition.
The following will delve into the history of arm wrestling, tracing its origins, evolution, and cultural significance as well as touch on the specific muscles used in this hand-to-hand competition of brute strength.
The origins of arm wrestling are somewhat murky, with no definitive record of its birth. However, the sport can be traced back to ancient times. Historical references to arm wrestling can be found in ancient texts and artwork from civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans.
Arm wrestling was often seen as a test of strength and a form of friendly competition. These early arm wrestling contests lacked the standardized rules and regulations we see today, but they laid the foundation for the sport's development.
Arm wrestling also gained popularity in the Middle Ages, especially in Europe. Knights and warriors engaged in arm wrestling as a form of training and recreation. It was also considered a way to build arm and upper body strength, essential for combat in the era of knights in armor.  In essence, it was a form of medieval bodybuilding.
Arm wrestling was not only a sport, but also a test of a man's prowess, often occurring in taverns or during fairs.  The modernization and standardization of arm wrestling can be attributed to the emergence of organized competitions in the 20th century.
Today, up near the Arctic Circle in Nome, Alaska, arm wrestling has become a popular challenge after the grueling famous dog sled race Iditarod. Those who just finished this grueling race enter into the famous arm wrestling competition at the finish line, despite the incredible post-race fatigue.
The first recorded arm wrestling tournament took place in the United States in the 1950s. It was organized by Bill Soberanes and became a pivotal moment in the sport's history. Soberanes founded the National Arm Wrestling Championships in 1962, and the sport gained traction.
As arm wrestling tournaments became more structured, they adopted a set of rules and weight classes, making the sport more accessible and competitive. These competitions attracted enthusiasts from various backgrounds, and arm wrestling began to grow as a legitimate sport.
Arm wrestling gained worldwide recognition when the World Armwrestling Federation (WAF) was established in 1977. The WAF has played a vital role in promoting arm wrestling as a global sport, organizing international competitions and championships.
Today, arm wrestling has a presence in over 80 countries and continues to draw participants and fans from all corners of the globe.
The sport has also inspired a subculture of professional arm wrestlers who compete at the highest level. Athletes like John Brzenk and Devon Larratt have achieved legendary status in the world of arm wrestling, demonstrating the dedication and skill required to excel in this sport.
Arm wrestling has become a competitive endeavor with its own stars and fan base, with major events like the Armwrestling World Championships and the World Armwrestling League (WAL) attracting top talent.
Arm wrestling has also found its place in popular culture. It has appeared in numerous movies, television shows, and documentaries. The dramatic showdowns, where competitors grapple with all their might, have an undeniable appeal to audiences worldwide.
What Muscles Are Used In Arm Wrestling?
The Power of the Biceps
The following are light fictitious examples of arm wrestling techniques and muscles used in competition:
Jake and Adam were in an intense arm wrestling match. Their locked hands were centered on the table, and the crowd eagerly watched as they strained against each other. Jake, known for his bulging biceps, flexed his arm with determination. His biceps were the driving force behind his initial push, putting immense pressure on Adam's arm.
The crowd could see the veins in Jake's biceps pulsating as he applied his strength to the match. However, Adam was not one to be underestimated. He had a rock-solid brachialis, which he utilized to counter Jake's biceps-driven force. It was a fierce battle between the biceps and the brachialis, with the outcome far from certain.
The Role of Forearm Muscles
In the next match, Emma and Mike faced off. Emma had meticulously trained her forearm muscles, knowing they played a crucial role in arm wrestling. As the match began, she used her forearm strength to control the wrist angle, subtly tilting her wrist downwards.
This maneuver put Mike at a mechanical disadvantage, as his wrist started to bend under the pressure. Emma's wrist flexors were engaged, working against Mike's wrist extensors. As a result, she gained leverage, and the spectators marveled at the finesse with which she manipulated her opponent's arm. Her mastery of forearm muscles ultimately secured her victory.
The Battle of Pronation and Supination
The third match pitted Alex against Chris. As they grappled, it became apparent that Alex's supinator muscles were highly developed. He deftly turned his hand upward, forcing Chris into an uncomfortable position. Chris, however, was quick to respond.
He engaged his pronator teres and skillfully countered Alex's move by rotating his hand downward. It was a captivating showdown of forearm rotation, with both competitors using their pronator teres and supinator muscles to outmaneuver each other. The match showcased the significance of these muscles in gaining the upper hand in arm wrestling.
The Grip Strength Duel
In the final match of the day, Sarah and Mark went head-to-head. Mark was renowned for his tremendous grip strength, which he had honed through years of dedicated training. As they grappled, Mark's hand muscles were like a vice, firmly gripping Sarah's hand.
He was relentless, using his finger flexors to maintain an unyielding hold. Sarah, however, had developed exceptional finger extensor strength, enabling her to resist Mark's powerful grip. The match evolved into a gripping duel of finger strength, with each contestant leveraging their hand muscles to maintain control.
The Shoulder Support
In the local arm wrestling championship, Sarah faced off against Max. Sarah, despite her petite frame, had incredibly strong deltoid muscles in her shoulders. As the match began, Max, known for his powerful arm, attempted to force Sarah's arm down.
However, Sarah's shoulders played a pivotal role. She maintained an unwavering shoulder position, using her deltoid strength to resist Max's initial push. The spectators were amazed at the stability and control she exhibited, proving that the shoulders were not to be underestimated in arm wrestling. With strategic use of her shoulder muscles, Sarah outlasted Max and claimed victory.
The Core for Balance
In the national arm wrestling finals, two titans, Alex and Emma, faced each other. Both had incredible arm strength, but it was their core muscles that made the difference. As the match progressed, both competitors strained against each other, attempting to gain the upper hand. Emma's well-developed core provided her with a stable foundation.
Her back muscles kept her posture solid, allowing her to channel her arm strength effectively. Despite Alex's immense power, Emma's core control and back muscles gave her the edge, and she eventually overcame her opponent.
The Sudden Grip Strategy
In a thrilling arm wrestling showdown, Mark and Chris found themselves in a deadlock. Mark had superior grip strength, and Chris was known for his forearm rotation skills. As the match began, Mark initiated a fierce grip, putting Chris on the defensive.
But Chris had a surprise strategy up his sleeve. He suddenly engaged his pronator teres, rapidly rotating his forearm and wrist, causing Mark's grip to weaken. The spectators gasped as they witnessed the importance of forearm rotation in real-time. With this unexpected move, Chris turned the tables and emerged as the winner.
The Comprehensive Victory
In the grand championship, Sarah, Mark, Alex, and Emma entered a four-way arm wrestling battle. The match was a masterclass in the use of various muscle groups. Sarah displayed her shoulder strength, Mark showcased his grip power, Alex demonstrated his forearm rotation, and Emma exhibited her core control.
The match was a thrilling display of their combined skills. In the end, Emma's versatile use of muscles came to the forefront. She not only withstood the initial challenges but also used her core strength, forearm rotation, and grip to secure victory. It was a testament to the significance of a holistic approach to arm wrestling.
What Muscles Are Used in Arm Wrestling:
Arm wrestling is not just a test of brute strength but also a game of technique and endurance. To be successful, arm wrestlers need a combination of powerful upper body muscles and an understanding of leverage.
Next, we will explore the key muscle groups that come into play during an arm wrestling match.
The Mighty Biceps
The biceps brachii, commonly known as the biceps, are the showstoppers in arm wrestling. These muscles are responsible for flexing the elbow joint, which is a crucial part of the arm wrestling movement. Biceps strength contributes significantly to the force you can exert on your opponent's arm.
The Deep Brachialis
The brachialis muscle lies beneath the biceps. Although it's often overshadowed by its bigger neighbor, the brachialis is a powerhouse when it comes to elbow flexion. It plays a vital role in arm wrestling by adding strength to your arm's bending action.
The Trusty Brachioradialis
Located in the forearm, the brachioradialis muscle helps stabilize the elbow joint. It aids in maintaining your arm's structural integrity during an arm wrestling match and can provide extra power when flexing your arm.
Forearm Strength
The forearm muscles, particularly the wrist flexors and extensors, are instrumental in arm wrestling. These muscles control wrist movement, allowing you to adjust your wrist angle and maintain leverage during a match. Grip strength, which is crucial in arm wrestling, is also rooted in the forearm muscles.
Forearm Rotation with Pronator Teres and Supinator Muscles
Pronation and supination, the ability to turn your hand down (pronation) or up (supination), are essential movements in arm wrestling. The pronator teres and supinator muscles in the forearm enable these actions. Skillfully using these muscles can give you a significant advantage in a match.
The Strength of the Hand
Intrinsic hand muscles, such as finger flexors and extensors, contribute to maintaining a strong grip. Grip strength is a game-changer in arm wrestling, as it allows you to control your opponent's hand, dictate the match's direction, and gain the upper hand.
Support from the Shoulders
While the primary action happens in the arm and forearm, the deltoid muscles in the shoulder also play a role. They provide stability and control during an arm wrestling match, preventing unnecessary movement and ensuring that your strength is applied precisely.
Back and Core Muscles
A solid foundation is crucial in arm wrestling. Upper back and core muscles help maintain proper body position and stability during a match. Keeping a strong and steady posture allows you to harness your full strength effectively.
What Muscles Are Used in Arm Wrestling:  Conclusion
In conclusion, the history of arm wrestling is a testament to the enduring appeal of physical contests of strength and skill. From its humble beginnings in ancient civilizations to the organized tournaments and international recognition of today, arm wrestling has come a long way. Arm wrestling is not just about flexing your biceps; it's a complex interplay of various muscle groups. Your biceps, brachialis, brachioradialis, forearm muscles, pronator teres, supinator muscles, hand muscles, shoulder muscles, back muscles, and core muscles all come together to determine your success in arm wrestling. To excel in this sport, you need to develop and condition these muscles, understand the mechanics, and practice smart technique.
A sport that brings people together, arm wrestling transcends cultural and language barriers, and continues to grow in popularity. Whether it's a casual challenge at a local bar or a world championship match, arm wrestling will remain a captivating display of human strength and determination, and as seen above, a challenge to multiple upper body muscle groups overall.

Most people see arm wrestling as a battle of strength, but champion arm wrestlers know that technique is critical. In fact, winning an arm-wrestling match has less to do with brute strength than with the way in which you place your body and torso in relation to your opponent. Rather than trying to push your opponent's arm down, use your arm and shoulder strength to pull down on your opponent's hand.

From playground to pub, your ability to drive a mate’s hand into the dust has always come with maximum kudos. But for years the winner’s circle has been the reserve of Jim Bro, not Joe Public. Unless you have biceps straining at your shirtsleeves, victory is far from guaranteed – until now. We asked former arm wrestling world champion and founder of ArmWars, Neil Pickup, to pass on the trade secrets that took him to the top. Tap in to his tips to make you opponent tap out.
Pick your opponent
The key to winning any war is picking your battles. “It’s very important to understand your own physical characteristics,” says Pickup. Have you got a long or short forearm? And, more importantly, has your opponent got a shorter or longer forearm than you? “Arm wrestling is all about leverage,” says Pickup. “And a long forearm will give you an advantage over brute strength.” Target the short guy who spends all-day at the bench. His muscles will make your long lever-driven victory all the more impressive. Equally, avoid the beanpole of your group. You don’t want to come off second best against the guy with twigs for arms – which you will.
Become a technician
Catch your competitor unaware with one of these professional techniques to secure victory in a second.
The toproll technique
Suited to those of you with a longer forearm; size matters when it comes to this technique. Use it to force your opponent’s fingers open and stop them using the power in their forearm.
The hook technique
Perfect for people with short forearms, this move negates any lengthy advantages your competitor might have. It uses your wrist strength to twist their arm and disable any top roll plans they might be hatching.
Hit the gym
Tweak your workout with these three tips and target the muscles you need to become unbeatable. It’s all in the grips.
Hammer curl
Update your standard bicep exercise by keeping your hands in the neutral position throughout the rep. This shifts the emphasis to your forearm and perfectly mimics the forces you need for arm wrestling.
Weighted vest hangs
Strap on 20kgs and head to the pull-up bar. Use a neutral grip (thumbs pointing towards you) and lift up until your elbows are at 90 degrees. Hold for 30 seconds and repeat twice. These isometric holds build serious forearm strength turning your arm into the immovable object.
Fat grips
Add these to your barbells and dumbbells and see your grip strength soar. Don’t expect any PBs at the bench, they’ll make every move more difficult, but they’ll also give you the power to crush your opponent’s hand, break their grip and make victory a certainty.
Bend the rules
A string of victories can attract unwanted attention and, sooner or later, a fellow pub sportsman will try and take you down a peg. But when you’re staring down the barrel of bigger biceps and longer levers, there’s still a chance of victory – and extra bragging rights. As you set up, grip high on your opponent’s thumb to open up their hand and weaken his forearm. Next, make your arm as vertical as possible and pull their fist close to you. The greater the distance between his fist and shoulder, the more difficult it is for him to throw weight behind the press. “This tactic isn’t competition legal but against the uninitiated it’ll give you an immediate advantage,” says Pickup. Just try and not be too ungracious in victory – he’s still bigger than you, remember.

Discover essential techniques to improve your arm wrestling skills with our comprehensive guide. Learn about Rising, Cupping, Wrist Cupping, Pronation, Belt Grip, and Strength Training to dominate your arm wrestling matches. Perfect for beginners and seasoned competitors alike
Here’s a list of key techniques how to get better at arm wrestling.
Rising
The Rising technique in arm wrestling is a strategic move that focuses on lifting your opponent’s hand upwards to gain leverage. This technique is not just about physical strength; it’s about understanding the mechanics of leverage and using it to your advantage.
Rising works by targeting the weakest point in your opponent’s grip – typically the fingers or the wrist. By lifting their hand upwards, you disrupt their stable position, making it harder for them to apply force effectively. This move shifts the battle from sheer force to a more strategic manipulation of leverage.
The key to rising is in the wrist and fingers. The action involves a combination of wrist flexion and finger extension. By flexing your wrist upwards while extending your fingers, you create an upward force on your opponent’s grip. This movement requires strength in the forearm and flexibility in the wrist.
To effectively implement rising in a match:
To train for rising, focus on exercises that strengthen your wrists and forearms. Wrist curls, reverse wrist curls, and finger extensions are great exercises. Additionally, practicing the rising movement with a partner or using an arm wrestling table can help develop the specific muscles and techniques needed.
Cupping: Securing a Strong Grip
Cupping is a fundamental technique in arm wrestling that involves curling your hand towards your wrist. This move is essential for establishing and maintaining a strong, controlling grip on your opponent’s hand. Mastering cupping can significantly enhance your arm wrestling prowess by allowing you to dictate the flow of the match.
Cupping centers around the concept of reducing your opponent’s leverage while maximizing your own. By curling your fingers and thumb towards your wrist, you effectively ‘cup’ your hand, creating a concave shape. This action tightens your grip and limits your opponent’s ability to maneuver or escape.
To successfully implement cupping:
To train for this technique, focus on exercises that strengthen your forearm flexors and enhance your grip strength. Activities such as wrist curls, finger curls, and grip strength trainers are beneficial. Additionally, practicing the cupping motion during sparring sessions can help in developing muscle memory and technique refinement.
Wrist Cupping: A Twist on Traditional Cupping
Wrist cupping is an advanced arm wrestling technique that builds upon the basic cupping move by adding a twist to the wrist. This nuanced approach not only enhances grip strength but also introduces an element of control that can be pivotal in a match. Understanding and mastering wrist cupping can give arm wrestlers an edge, especially in challenging bouts.
The technique starts with the basic cupping motion – curling your hand towards your wrist. Once this grip is established, you then add a twisting motion. This rotation typically involves turning your wrist inwards, towards your body. This movement not only strengthens your grip but also disrupts your opponent’s alignment and leverage.
To effectively use wrist cupping in a match:
Developing proficiency in wrist cupping requires specific training focused on wrist flexibility and strength. Exercises like wrist curls with a twist, pronation and supination movements with weights, and grip strengthening exercises are particularly effective. Practice the combined cupping and twisting motion regularly to build muscle memory.
Wrist cupping offers a strategic advantage by providing a more secure grip and disrupting the opponent’s strategy. It can be particularly effective against opponents who rely heavily on their wrist strength or those who use techniques like top-rolling. Mastering wrist cupping can be a game-changer, especially in high-stakes matches where every little advantage counts.
Pronation: The Art of Twisting
Pronation in arm wrestling is a critical technique where you rotate your arm to make your palm face downwards. This movement is particularly effective for countering your opponent’s grip and can play a pivotal role in gaining the upper hand in a match. Mastering pronation can greatly enhance your arm wrestling abilities, providing a strategic advantage over opponents.
Pronation involves rotating the forearm so that the palm turns to face down. This move is crucial in arm wrestling as it can weaken your opponent’s grip and reduce their leverage. By pronating your arm, you apply a twisting force that can disrupt your opponent’s position and strategy, making it difficult for them to maintain a strong hold.

Pronation offers a strategic edge in arm wrestling by allowing you to counter various grip techniques and styles. It’s especially useful against opponents who rely on techniques like the top roll or hook. Effective pronation can shift the dynamics of a match, giving you the leverage to overpower your opponent.
Belt Grip
The Belt Grip is a lesser-known but highly effective technique in arm wrestling that involves utilizing your belt or waistband to gain additional stability and leverage during a match. This technique is particularly useful in situations where maintaining endurance and a steady position is crucial. Understanding and correctly implementing the Belt Grip can provide a significant advantage in arm wrestling competitions.
The Belt Grip technique is based on the principle of using your own body and clothing as leverage points. By gripping your belt or waistband with your non-wrestling hand, you create a point of stability that helps you anchor your body more effectively. This technique allows for better control over your movements and can help resist the force exerted by your opponent.
In arm wrestling, balance and stability are as important as strength. The Belt Grip aids in maintaining a balanced posture by providing an additional anchor point. By holding onto your belt or waistband, you can prevent your body from being easily moved or twisted by your opponent’s actions, thereby maintaining a more advantageous position.
To effectively use the Belt Grip:
While the Belt Grip doesn’t require specific physical training, it does require practice to master. Incorporating this technique into your practice sessions will help you get accustomed to the feel and benefits it offers. Focus on maintaining the grip throughout various movements and techniques to understand how it affects your overall performance.
The main advantage of the Belt Grip is the added stability and leverage it provides. This can be especially beneficial in lengthy matches where endurance plays a crucial role. It also offers a psychological edge, as maintaining a steady and controlled posture can be intimidating to opponents.
Strength
In the world of arm wrestling, strength training is more than just a routine; it’s a crucial component for achieving success. While techniques and strategies are vital, the role of physical strength, particularly in the forearms, biceps, and shoulders, cannot be overstated. A well-rounded strength training program can significantly enhance your arm wrestling capabilities.
Arm wrestling demands a unique combination of strength, endurance, and power. It’s a sport that tests the limits of your arm’s muscular capabilities. Strengthening the muscles in your forearm, biceps, and shoulders not only improves your ability to exert force but also enhances your resistance against your opponent’s moves.
Recovery is as crucial as the workout itself. Ensure you have adequate rest days and consider incorporating recovery techniques like stretching, massage, or foam rolling. Proper nutrition and hydration are also vital for muscle repair and growth.
Conclusion
Improving at arm wrestling requires a mix of technique, strategy, and physical strength. By mastering techniques like Rising, Cupping, Wrist Cupping, Pronation, and the Belt Grip, and by enhancing your overall strength, you can significantly improve your performance in this challenging sport. Remember, consistent practice, dedication, and learning from each match are key to becoming a formidable arm wrestler.

Discover essential techniques to improve your arm wrestling skills with our comprehensive guide. Learn about Rising, Cupping, Wrist Cupping, Pronation, Belt Grip, and Strength Training to dominate your arm wrestling matches. Perfect for beginners and seasoned competitors alike
Here’s a list of key techniques how to get better at arm wrestling.
Rising
The Rising technique in arm wrestling is a strategic move that focuses on lifting your opponent’s hand upwards to gain leverage. This technique is not just about physical strength; it’s about understanding the mechanics of leverage and using it to your advantage.
Rising works by targeting the weakest point in your opponent’s grip – typically the fingers or the wrist. By lifting their hand upwards, you disrupt their stable position, making it harder for them to apply force effectively. This move shifts the battle from sheer force to a more strategic manipulation of leverage.
The key to rising is in the wrist and fingers. The action involves a combination of wrist flexion and finger extension. By flexing your wrist upwards while extending your fingers, you create an upward force on your opponent’s grip. This movement requires strength in the forearm and flexibility in the wrist.
To effectively implement rising in a match:
To train for rising, focus on exercises that strengthen your wrists and forearms. Wrist curls, reverse wrist curls, and finger extensions are great exercises. Additionally, practicing the rising movement with a partner or using an arm wrestling table can help develop the specific muscles and techniques needed.
Cupping: Securing a Strong Grip
Cupping is a fundamental technique in arm wrestling that involves curling your hand towards your wrist. This move is essential for establishing and maintaining a strong, controlling grip on your opponent’s hand. Mastering cupping can significantly enhance your arm wrestling prowess by allowing you to dictate the flow of the match.
Cupping centers around the concept of reducing your opponent’s leverage while maximizing your own. By curling your fingers and thumb towards your wrist, you effectively ‘cup’ your hand, creating a concave shape. This action tightens your grip and limits your opponent’s ability to maneuver or escape.
To successfully implement cupping:
To train for this technique, focus on exercises that strengthen your forearm flexors and enhance your grip strength. Activities such as wrist curls, finger curls, and grip strength trainers are beneficial. Additionally, practicing the cupping motion during sparring sessions can help in developing muscle memory and technique refinement.
Wrist Cupping: A Twist on Traditional Cupping
Wrist cupping is an advanced arm wrestling technique that builds upon the basic cupping move by adding a twist to the wrist. This nuanced approach not only enhances grip strength but also introduces an element of control that can be pivotal in a match. Understanding and mastering wrist cupping can give arm wrestlers an edge, especially in challenging bouts.

The most common is to grab the far wrist and drive your opponent over. When you are learning to wrestle, no matter if it is from the feet, top, or bottom, it is really important to learn series of moves that you can hit based on what is available.","Securing an Arm Bar from Top Position with Logan Stieber
There are many different pinning combinations you can learn in the sport of wrestling. When you take the time to learn and perfect one of them, you need to make sure that it will work at all levels of competition because there are many moves that, in reality, will not work on high level wrestlers. One pinning combination that you will see work at the highest levels of high school and college wrestling is an arm bar.
Logan Stieber was a four time NCAA champion from Ohio State and would often use an arm bar and tight waist to turn his opponents and get pins. In this video, he demonstrates how to secure an arm bar starting on top in referee’s position.
Let’s take a closer look at how Stieber stops his opponent’s first move, breaks them down flat, and then secures the arm bar.

Stopping your opponent’s first move should be your first priority when the whistle blows. Chances are your opponent will try to stand up or maybe try to sit-out and hit a switch, either way your main objective is to stop them from doing so. In the video, Stieber shows a small bump forward right when the whistle blows. Bumping your opponent forward will force them to put weight on their hands and stop them from hitting a standup. As soon as he bumps, Stieber goes into a spiral ride breakdown where he drops the far hand down to the thigh and the near hand bumps the opposite arm forward. Watch how Stieber comes to the side and secures the near side wrist.
Once your opponent is broken down and the near wrist is secured, you will drive them forward to flatten them out. While driving forward, roll the wrist under and it should pop out the side. Pay attention to Stieber’s position in relation to his opponent. He is keeping a lot of pressure on him by keeping his head and chest up and continually driving his feet into the mat. One mistake that people often make is they stay back on their knees and do not keep pressure on their opponent.
Now pull the arm out and place in on their low back. If you are struggling to get the arm out, watch how Stieber sits out and uses both hands to attack the wrist and secures it on the low back. Once the wrist is secured on the low back, get on top of your opponent. Be sure to keep your chest up and use your belly to help pin the wrist and arm to the low back keeping lots of pressure on your opponent the entire time.
Once you have the arm pinned to their low back, secure the wrist with your opposite hand and slide your near hand under the elbow. Then clear the hand off the low back so it is back at your opponent’s side. Pay attention to how Stieber does it and how he is always keeping everything nice and tight. If it isn’t tight, your opponent will possibly be able to get his arm out. When the arm bar is locked up tight, there are a lot of different finishes you can do to get the pin. The most common is to grab the far wrist and drive your opponent over.
When you are learning to wrestle, no matter if it is from the feet, top, or bottom, it is really important to learn series of moves that you can hit based on what is available. This is why you often see high level wrestlers who specialize in certain takedowns, set-ups, tilts, two on ones, etc. It is impossible for one person to master every single technique in wrestling, so instead you should find a couple things and get really good at them. Then, you can build your wrestling strategies around what you are really good at.
As always, make sure you are drilling these moves over and over to get the correct technique down. Hopefully this will help you to use armbars more effectively in your upcoming season.
When you watch Stieber wrestle, one of the things you will see is that he is a master at the armbar series. In fact, Logan has an entire instructional video series on arm bars titled “The Armbar Blueprint by Logan Stieber”. If you want to learn more about how to set up and pin guys using armbars then you definitely need to check out his video.

If one series was to be declared the undisputed king of top techniques, it would be the half nelson wrestling series. The half nelson series has few defenses, and despite how effective it is, there is not very much technique required to execute it. All that is required to be extremely effective with it is a hard nose and the will to win.
Step 1 of Half Nelson Wrestling Technique:  The Breakdown
With your best breakdown, in this case the ankle down, break your opponent to their belly. Immediately transition to a three post position – both of your feet in the mat, your non-half nelson forearm at the base of the back of your opponent’s neck. You will need to use your hips and legs to drive the weight forward to keep their head down to later apply the half nelson.
Step 2 of Half Nelson Wrestling Technique: Get A Deep Half Nelson
When applying the half nelson, throw an uppercut with your half nelson arm under the opponent’s arm and drive it forward. When securing the half nelson, your fingertips should grab the opponent’s far ear and you should be able to read your wristwatch – if you had one on.
Step 3 of Half Nelson Wrestling Technique: Basic Half Nelson
When the half nelson is applied, drive the opponent to their opposite side than which you’re on. Once they are on their side, sink your arm elbow deep with your throat resting on their side. This will ensure the proper chest-to-chest pinning position with the half nelson. In the pin position, be sure to have your forehead on the mat and your feet wide, at the same time lifting your opponent’s head to apply the maximum amount of body pressure.
Step 4 of Half Nelson Wrestling Technique: Power Half Nelson
If the opponent puts up a bigger fight, the power half nelson will be needed. This time when you apply the half nelson, turn your non-half nelson hand up and lock your half-nelson hand on top of it. This will create a prybar affect on your opponent’s arm. Drive your opponent to their side so you can “read your wristwatch”. Finish the power half nelson the same way as you do the basic half nelson.
Step 5 of Half Nelson Wrestling Technique:  Spike Half Nelson
If your opponent builds up to their base, keep your elbow up at all times. Step up with your front foot and plant your inside knee in front of your opponent’s inside knee. Your first objective is to gather the far wrist by running over it. If you can keep the wrist, do so. If you feel yourself getting too high, release the wrist and get the pin by applying the same half nelson finish and the previous situations.
Step 6 of Half Nelson Wrestling Technique: Sweep Half Nelson
If you can not perform the spike half nelson, slide your inside knee in front of opponent’s inside knee. Sweep the opponent across your knee by pulling the half nelson and the wrist. This will put them on their far side, in the same position as the previous finishes. Understand that if you get to this step, you’ll probably have to use a combination of the sweep and spike half nelsons to get them onto their side.
Step 7 of Half Nelson Wrestling Technique: Suck Back
The changeover is an effective way to combat a good half nelson, you have to be ready for it. When your opponent tries a changeover from your half nelson position, release the half nelson and hook under both of their armpits. Drop step back, pull them back to danger position and put your chin on top of their shoulder to secure them to the mat. To get the pin, release the hook on the opoosite side of your head and wrap it on top of the front of your opponent’s head. Drive your shoulder into their chest as you turn the same hip down to ensure the pin.
Step 8 of Half Nelson Wrestling Technique: Hook and Post the Head
If your opponent turns away from the suckback, hook their elbow on the same side as your head. Put your elbow in their back, come off your knees to keep the pressure on them and post your other hand on their head to stop them from getting to their belly. Rotate out front of your opponent and replace your hand that is posting the head with your corresponding knee. With both hands, pull the hooked arm to your chest and thread the your arm opposite the hook. You are now in a deep half nelson position and can take them to danger. This and the suckback finish can both be used when the opponent is balling up on bottom. If they are doing that, pull them up to a sit position and perform either finish.
Step 9 of Half Nelson Wrestling Technique:  Spiral Ride Half Nelson
From the referees position, as you step your lead foot up, place your belly button hand inside your oponent’s thigh and your elbow hand extends their arm above the elbow. Be sure to get high on your opponent’s base to keep the weight forward and use your head to drive their head down. Keep driving the opponent down, with a combination of lifting their arm and driving their head down, as you drive your half nelson in and look for the far wrist. Once you get the half nelson, the series starts.
Step 10 of Half Nelson Wrestling Technique: Near Wrist Roll Half Nelson
Another great setup to the half nelson series is to capitalize off your opponent’s near wrist defense. Apply a near wrist to your opoonent. When they roll their wrist to clear, hook the elbow and throw your half nelson in from that side. The half nelson series now starts.
The keys to this series are securing a proper breakdown, and keeping weight forward throughout. Once these parts of the technique are established, the different options within the series will present themselves. Master a series which is both technical, and punishing!

Whether it's full, half, or quarter, the Nelson hold is one of the most ubiquitous techniques in the wrestling world. And in BJJ it's also making its presence known because of the potential it holds for submission grappling in general.","A Guide To Nelson Holds In Submission Grappling
What started and became popular in wrestling is now finding its way on the BJJ mat. I’m talking about the famous, or infamous depending on how you look at it, Nelson Hold. In wrestling, it’s all about pinning down the opponent. But as we’ll see, Nelson Holds are great when it comes to submission grappling in BJJ as well.
Whether it’s full, half, or quarter, the Nelson hold is one of the most ubiquitous techniques in the wrestling world. And in BJJ it’s also making its presence known because of the potential it holds for submission grappling in general.
So what’s the deal with this Nelson Hold? How many variations are there anyway? And why has it taken so long for BJJ to catch up and discover the potential in this ancient wrestling technique? We’ll answer all of these questions and more in this comprehensive guide. We’ll cover its history, get a little technical, and describe what makes it stand out, and then segue into the different variations and how to use them with maximum efficiency.
History of Nelson Holds
As far as names go, this one can’t be traced back to a concrete incident or person in history. Why was the Nelson Hold named like that? Or who was that Nelson? There’s no satisfying answer to any of these questions. However, if we dig deeper into wrestling folklore we might find a clue.
In the early nineteenth century, wrestlers used to talk about “putting the nelson” on someone. It was such a common term that street fighters would often use it to talk about their brawls. Since wrestling originated in Britain and crossed the pond with the first immigrants, then we can turn our gaze that way and look for a famous or semi-famous Nelson to fit the bill.
Horatio Nelson was a Vice-Admiral in the British fleet and he was the one that single-handedly put a stop to Napoleon Bonaparte’s dreams of adding Britain to his great empire. After the battle of Waterloo, the French armada was decimated, Nelson triumphed, and Napoleon never recovered from the defeat. Mind you, Nelson never went one on one with Napoleon nor was he known for his wrestling proclivities.
It’s easy to see why Nelson entered the cultural scene and took center place in people’s daily lives. Without him, Britain would probably be speaking French now along with the rest of Europe. So to use his name to a popular hold that even kids used in the street brawls seems like the least the Brits could do. And from there, the term traveled to the New World where it became a common name in American Folkstyle wrestling.
But why Nelson? What’s so special about this maneuver that made it survive the journey across the Atlantic, set roots in American soil, and grow in popularity that it too invades the streets, bars, and wrestling joints in the New World? The answer to that is as involved as the question itself. So let’s get up close and personal to the Nelson hold and see what makes it such a durable feature of the wrestling lore. In other words, let’s get technical and deconstruct this famous technique into its basic components.
The Technical Nitty-Gritty of Nelson Holds
So what is the nelson hold exactly? The first thing you need to be aware of is your body position and posture in relation to the opponent. To get a Nelson to work properly in your favor, make sure you’re in a perpendicular position. It’s true this is more specific to the half-nelson, but as we’ll see later, the half-nelson is the more popular of all the nelson varieties so much so that when you talk about nelson, most people would think of the half rather than full or quarter nelson.
To have a perpendicular position over your opponent on the mat is more suitable to BJJ rather than to wrestling. The rules in wrestling have changed but from a submission grappling point of view, this is your ideal posture. Whether you’re going on the offensive or assuming a defensive position, the nelson has got your back. How is that?
For one thing, when you’re on the defensive and you’re perpendicular to your opponent, that means you don’t have to worry about the rival tripping, rolling, or trapping. You’re perfectly safe from any of that and you’re fully prepared for what’s coming. As we all know, on the mat, a slight error of judgment can be detrimental to the whole match.
And if you’re on the offensive, then going head to head with the opponent allows you to execute the flank push most effectively. Just think about it. You’re both facing each other, and that leaves the opponent to your offensive since the nelson gives you much room to maneuver and take it wherever you want to go with it. As a result you can utilize your own weight as leverage which has many advantages.
The other thing that has contributed to the durability of nelson holds is the hand position. The underlying laws of the nelson hold is how you apply leverage. Your hand position can make or break the whole hold and either render it useless or lead you to the desired outcome of getting closer to a submission. Here you need to pay attention to two things.
The first is the opponent’s elbow. You need to apply as much force as possible near the elbow. The other is the top of the head. That’s where the second point of contact is and in many ways the one that really gives you full control over the opponent’s movement and whole posture.
An alternative is to work on the underarm and neck of the opponent. But that position doesn’t give you as much power as you hope and is easy for the opponent to weasel their way out of it as we will see later.
Whichever mechanical position you go for, always remember to go for the side nearest to you first. This paves the way for you to secure the other side as well. But if you reach out to the far side, you basically undermine your hold and allow the rival to escape without much difficulty. Not to mention that your stability and your own posture would be in question. You could easily trip or lose balance which backfires spectacularly.
If you keep all these points in mind when executing a nelson, your opponent will not be able to raise a defense that would reverse your hold and turn it against you as you undoubtedly have seen it happen many times before.
So what is the purpose of the nelson hold? Well, oftentimes it’s used for one of two goals.
Nelson Holds Varieties
Even though the rules of BJJ have rendered most of the varieties of the nelson hold rather redundant, we can still look at some of the wrestling versions for inspiration. In addition to all the benefits we detailed above when talking about the technical aspect of the nelson hold, it also provides some tactical advantages that you just can’t overlook or ignore.
For the purpose of our guide, the nelson hold has four varieties:
We will focus here on the last two. The half nelson hold deserves a whole guide on its own since it’s the one widely practiced both in wrestling rings and on BJJ mats. The quarter nelson also has a lot to offer if you spend enough time to learn all its nuances.
Half Nelson
The thing about the half nelson is that it’s so versatile and gives you lots of power and leeway, you can perform it either from a standing position or on the mat. And the best part is, you can execute the move flawlessly from either position and take it to the desired outcome without much compromise.
What the half nelson lacks in control over the opponent’s body compared to the full nelson, it more than makes up for it in the mobility. You’re able to distribute your weight around to gain the most advantage and use your body as leverage. It also gives you many points of attack to focus on which means your opponent will be at a loss mounting up a defense since they don’t know how you will attack.
But that’s not all. The half nelson also allows you to launch your attack without ever losing your grip. It doesn’t get any better than that. While the opponent is physically restrained and totally under your control, you’re ready to make your move and launch an offensive that leads to submission. Put simply, the half nelson gives you a whole lot of dominant positions to choose from and surprise your almost defenseless opponent.
In general, the half nelson is often used for one of three possible goals.
Quarter Nelson
If the half nelson was the backbone of most wrestling moves, in BJJ, it’s the quarter nelson that really gets you where you want to go especially for the purposes of submission grappling. The reason has to do with the differences between wrestling and BJJ in their definition of the turtle position or “hands and knees”.
In that position, the head and spine form a straight line and the eyes of the opponent is straight at the floor. However, new variations mean the head sometimes goes up and breaks the line forming from the spine to the head. It’s a subtle difference but has a great impact on the application of the quarter nelson in BJJ. In what way?
For one thing, the quarter nelson is really effective when you have full control over the back of the head. But if the head moves up, that means you lose control over that region which renders the quarter nelson less effective. However, with submission grappling where you can strangle the opponent, then bringing the head up doesn’t really affect the power of the quarter nelson.
That means that you can use the quarter nelson as part of a whole bunch of offensive strategies that give you a huge advantage. To be honest, of all the four nelson holds, this is the least vulnerable. The reason being the near arm is not all the way under the opponent’s arm which allows you much leeway to move it around and change your weight.
In other words, as long as you keep a safe distance, there’s no risk the opponent could reverse this position and get you under their control. What’s more, even if the opponent manages to escape from the quarter nelson, he will not get much advantage out of that. He would either end up in a similarly bad position or one which is even worse.
The quarter nelson is such a rich and great technique that many variations of it exist today in practice. These include:
Whether you prefer the half nelson, quarter nelson, or any other variation of the nelson hold, one thing is for sure, submission grappling has never been the same once the nelson hold has been introduced to the sport.

For those that have competed in wrestling, they are well aware of the power of the half nelson hold. This effective technique has translated very well to Jiu Jitsu, where it’s to advance to dominant positions and set up submissions.
Let’s dive in and tell you everything you need to know about the half nelson. We’ll go over how the technique works and important details you need to know for successfully using the move.
Contents
Who Invented The Half Nelson?
The half nelson has been an effective technique that has been used in wrestling for thousands of years. It has primarily been used as a way to control an opponent.
Hooking their arm and controlling their head to either force them to their back or just control them. The effectiveness has led to all forms of grappling like BJJ and MMA to adopt the technique.
It has evolved from just a controlling position in wrestling to a more diverse technique in the other forms of grappling.
Fighters now use the half nelson to do everything from advance to better positions, set up submissions, or land strikes.
How Does The Half Nelson Hold Work?
The half nelson hold gives you control over your opponent by controlling their head and arm. In wrestling, it is predominantly used to force an opponent to their back to gain points and set up a pin.
Jiu Jitsu and MMA have adopted the move to do a wide variety of different tactics. You can use the move to do everything from set up submissions, back takes, advance to mount, or just strikes.
It is an incredibly effective move that all grapplers within BJJ, wrestling, and MMA learn to improve their ground games. They all use it, because it’s proven to be effective.
The Traditional Half Nelson
The traditional half nelson hold in wrestling is used to turn your opponent to their back and set up a pin. It starts when you already have your opponent flattened out on their stomach.
To start the half nelson, you gain wrist control on their far arm by reaching under their arm. Grab their wrist and pull it into their chest.
You then reach under their near arm to grab your half nelson hold. When you grab the half nelson, be sure to grab the back of their head. Grabbing the back of their head gives you better control.
Next, lift your chest up, and drive diagonally as you force your opponent to roll their head under their shoulder. Making them do a forward roll to their back.
In wrestling, you can now set up your pin or take the mount if you’re doing BJJ training.
Power Half Nelson
The power half nelson is a stronger version of the standard half nelson that’s done a variety of ways. This variation starts out where you have your opponent flattened out and a figure four on their leg.
Base your hand on the back of their head and reach under their arm with your other hand. Grabbing the blade of your opponent’s head and bringing it to their head.
Next, you can either lock in the half nelson by grabbing your wrist or your opponent’s wrist. It makes no difference as the control is the same.
To turn your opponent to their back, undo your figure four, step toward their head, and keep turning your arm. Do it slowly to keep pressure on their neck/back as they go to their back.
Gordon Ryan’s Half Nelson Hold For Back Control
In Jiu Jitsu, Gordon Ryan has been using the half nelson in his back attack system for years. It creates optimal control over his opponent’s to set up submissions and make their lives miserable.
Ryan uses it in a variety of ways to make his opponents turn and set up his rear naked choke.
Half Nelson On Turtles Opponent
When Gordon is on his opponent’s back, he is able to make them turn on his side by using a half nelson. He switches from the traditional seatbelt grip, bringing his top arm behind his opponent’s head, and Gable grips his hands together.
The blade of his forearm presses into the back of his opponent’s neck to apply pressure as he makes them turn. It’s normal for an opponent to try to block the turn by basing out with their hand.
When they do this, Ryan anchors his back foot to the mat and forces them to turn. Once he addressed this counter, Gordon uses his half nelson to force his opponent’s head down and gets his hooks.
Half Nelson To Mount
Ryan has also been shown to use the technique to take the mount position. The use of this technique works similar to how it’s traditionally used in wrestling.
You have your opponent’s back with them flattened out, but you want to take mount. Lock on the half nelson to force them to turn and get the mount.
Another Back Attack Variation
There’s a nice back take that involves using the half nelson to open your opponent up when they’re turtled. Start by pulling your opponent off-base towards you on their side.
When they go to recover, hook your near leg onto their near leg to establish a point of control. Next, you’re going to go into lock on your half nelson hold on their far arm.
Hook one hand under their far arm and frame your arm on the back of their head. You can either lock your hands together with a Gable grip or S-grip.
As you lock in your half nelson, take your free foot and hook the inside of your opponent’s far foot. Use the half nelson grip along with the foot hook to pull your opponent into your back mount.
Half Nelson To Defend Guard Recovery
A lot of BJJ grapplers have begun using a pseudo form of the half nelson hold to counter their opponents’ recovering guard. From the side control, your opponent tries the traditional escape by turning in and doing an elbow escape.
When they turn in, you’re going to take semi half nelson on their near arm. Your arm overhooks your opponent’s arm and your other hand bases on the back of their head.
Use this semi half nelson to push your opponent’s head in as you transition around their head. Going to the other side control and controlling them from there.
Hammerlock Half Nelson
The half nelson hold can also be used as a submission, which in catch wrestling they call a hammerlock half nelson. A mix of the two techniques with numerous variations that are taught.
When your opponent is in turtle, hold their hip with one arm and take wrist control on their near arm. Next, flatten them out by driving forward as you push your forehead into their elbow.
Once they fall to their stomach, slide your wrist control up and grab your opponent’s tricep. From there, keep your weight down as you slide across their back to the other side of their body.
Take your half nelson on that side to establish full control over your opponent. Drive forward, lock your hands, together, and keep driving forward to put immense pressure on your opponent’s arms and neck.
Important Tips To Remember
A half nelson hold provides optimal control over your opponent, no matter what form of grappling you’re doing. Here are important tips and details to remember.

In the world of professional wrestling, leg drops are powerful and crowd-pleasing moves that can leave a lasting impact on opponents. This article will explore the art of leg drop wrestling, including leg wrestling moves, the wrestling leg ride, the purpose of leg slaps in wrestling, and effective defenses against the leg ride.
What this article covers:
1. Leg Wrestling Moves:
Leg wrestling moves encompass various techniques that involve using your legs to gain an advantage over your opponent. While leg drops are a prominent aspect of leg wrestling, there are other moves worth mentioning:a) Leg Lariat: The leg lariat is a high-impact move where a wrestler jumps into the air, extending one leg to strike their opponent's upper body or head. This move requires precise timing and agility to execute effectively, and it can result in a significant advantage in the match.b) Leg Whip: A leg whip involves grabbing your opponent's leg and forcefully swinging it in a lateral or circular motion. This technique can destabilize your opponent's balance and create openings for takedowns or transitions into other moves.

2. Wrestling Leg Ride:
The wrestling leg ride is a strategic maneuver that aims to control and immobilize your opponent by using their legs. This technique requires a combination of balance, strength, and positioning. Here's a glimpse into leg ride wrestling:a) Cross Body Ride: The cross body ride involves wrapping your arm around your opponent's leg while maintaining a parallel position. By exerting pressure and leveraging your body weight, you can control your opponent's movements, score points, or even attempt a pin.b) Spiral Ride: In the spiral ride, the wrestler positions themselves diagonally behind their opponent. By securing control of the leg and utilizing body positioning, the wrestler can maintain control, keep their opponent off balance, and create scoring opportunities.
3. Leg Slap in Wrestling:
A leg slap is a technique primarily seen in professional wrestling, specifically in entertainment-based promotions. It involves a wrestler slapping their own thigh or leg during a strike or impact to create a loud sound effect. Leg slaps are utilized to enhance the perception of the move's impact and engage the audience. It is important to note that leg slaps are more prevalent in entertainment-focused wrestling rather than traditional amateur wrestling.
4. Defending the Leg Ride in Wrestling:
Effectively defending against the leg ride is essential for maintaining control and preventing your opponent from scoring. Here are a few defensive strategies to consider:a) Solid Base and Balance: Focus on maintaining a strong base and solid balance to defend against the leg ride. By establishing a stable position, you make it more challenging for your opponent to control your legs and execute leg wrestling moves effectively.b) Leg Defense Techniques: Practice leg defense techniques such as leg pummeling, leg clearing, or counters specifically designed to neutralize leg ride attempts. These moves can help you regain control and create counterattacking opportunities.c) Hand Fighting: Effective hand fighting can disrupt your opponent's leg ride attempts. By controlling their hands and wrists, you limit their ability to secure leg rides and manipulate your positioning.
Conclusion:
Leg drop wrestling is an exciting aspect of professional wrestling, where powerful leg-based moves captivate audiences. Understanding leg wrestling moves, such as leg lariats and leg whips, can help wrestlers gain an advantage. While leg slaps primarily pertain to entertainment-based wrestling, they contribute to the theatricality of the sport. Lastly, mastering defensive techniques against the leg ride is crucial for maintaining control and thriving in the competitive world of wrestling. Keep training, honing your skills, and expanding your repertoire to become a force to be reckoned with in the ring.

How to Make the Single Leg Takedown Work For BJJ, MMA and Wrestling Athletes
Do you want to learn one of the most effective and versatile takedowns in grappling? Whether you are a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, mixed martial arts, or wrestling athlete, mastering the single leg takedown will improve your game and confidence on the mat. In this article, you will learn the benefits of the single leg takedown, the different variations and setups, the common mistakes and counters, and some drills and tips to improve your single leg takedown game.
The Power Of Single Leg Takedowns
One of the most effective and commonly used takedowns in any grappling sport (that allows it) is the single leg takedown. This is mainly because there are many different variations and technical nuances of the single leg takedown. If you’re trying to learn the single leg takedown but you’re not sure where to start, let me break it down for you and show you how you might approach learning the single leg.
The single leg takedown is a technique that involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs, usually with both hands and using your position to force them to the ground. It is useful against tall and heavy opponents, as well as opponents who have a strong sprawl or guard. For over a decade, it has been the first choice for grapplers and combat athletes who like to compete.
Here are some of the advantages of using the single leg takedown over other takedowns:
Variations and Setups of the Single Leg Takedown
There are different types of single leg takedowns that you can use depending on your preference and situation. The main single leg variation categories are high single, low single, and mid-level single. For each type, we will explain how to perform single leg takedown effective variations step by step.
For future reference, virtually nobody in wrestling says “mid-level singles”. They’ll typically just refer to the three main types as high singles, single legs, and low singles.
High Single
The high single is the most common and basic form of single leg takedown . It is very easy to teach to beginners and involves grabbing your opponent around their knee.
High singles are easiest to learn since you don’t need to get into the complexities of the penetration step (which is where most beginners make their mistakes).
This variation is great if your opponent stands up in a very high stance or if you don’t want to drop to your knees with a single leg (due to a knee injury, for example).
To perform a high single leg takedown, you need to do the following steps:
Mid-Level Single
The mid-level single is a hybrid between a high single and a low single. It involves grabbing your opponent’s shin or calf instead of their knees or ankles. It has more power than a low single but more speed than a high single. It is the best single leg takedown variation for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in particular..
To perform a mid-level single leg takedown, you need to do the following steps:
Low Single
The low single is another variation of single leg takedown that involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle or foot. It is more difficult to perform than a high single but it has more precision and less risk of getting sprawled on.
Low singles are generally the favorite for fast and technical wrestlers since the attack focuses on precision and leverage (though there are exceptions to every rule). Setups are somewhat limited because you’ll tend to shoot a low single from a slightly farther distance.
Done wrong, a failed low single also puts you in a bad position where you’re extended and your opponent can put their weight on top of you like a sprawl, so there is more room for error than the other two variations. The plus side is that with the additional technical mastery, it’s also potentially the least energy-consuming of the single legs, which is why it tends to be the energy-efficient attack of choice for quick and technical wrestlers that can pull it off.
To perform a low single leg takedown, you need to do the following steps:
Common Mistakes and Counters of the Single Leg Takedown
As with all takedown techniques, there are some common mistakes that people make when attempting or defending the single leg takedown. Here are some along with ways how to correct them:
Mistakes When Attacking
Mistakes When Defending
There are also some effective ways to counter or escape the single leg takedown if you find yourself in trouble. Some of them are:
For each counter or escape, you need to act quickly and decisively before they secure their position.
Drills and Tips to Improve Your Single Leg Takedown Game
Practice makes perfect, especially when it comes to grappling techniques like the single leg takedown. Here are some training exercises or drills that can help you practice and improve your skills:
Double-Leg Drill
The double-leg drill is a simple drill that involves shooting for a double-leg takedown on your partner but instead of finishing it, you switch to a single-leg takedown on either side. This drill will help you develop speed, timing, accuracy, and transitions for your single-leg takedowns.
To perform this drill, you need to do the following steps:
Shadow Wrestling Drill
The shadow wrestling drill is another simple drill that involves practicing different types of single leg takedowns without a partner. This drill will help you improve your footwork, balance, coordination, and muscle memory for your single-leg takedowns.
To perform this drill, you need to do the following steps:
Partner Resistance Drill (Scrimmage)
The partner resistance drill is a more advanced drill that involves practicing single leg takedowns with a partner who offers different levels of resistance. This drill will help you test your skills, adapt to different situations, and overcome challenges for your single-leg takedowns.
To perform this drill, you need to do the following steps:
Single Leg Takedown Mastery Tips:
In addition to these drills, here are some general tips or advice that can help you master the single leg takedown technique:
How Do I Work on my Single Leg?
Choose your leg attack variation, learn the key finishing positions in that variation, and then master the setups. This sequence is unorthodox but there is a reason for the madness.
At the beginner levels, you can get a lot of mileage out of a mediocre setup but your inability to finish will put you in all kinds of trouble. You may also develop bad positional habits down the road if you’re used to getting extended as well.
Of course, I don’t mean have zero knowledge of how to set up an attack. Learn the basics there, but sharpen them after you feel confident in your finishes. Wrestlers tend to hesitate for their attacks due to their inability to finish their takedowns, so we want to mitigate this as much as possible by focusing on finishes first.
The single leg takedown is one of the most popular takedowns in wrestling. When you are controlling one of your opponent’s legs, your ability to score a takedown is far greater than your opponent’s ability to score a takedown. You can also personalize a single leg based on your body type, which makes it even more favorable. There seems to be endless variations and nuances of single leg takedowns.
Conclusion
The single-leg takedown is one of the most effective and versatile techniques in grappling that can give you an edge over your opponents. Whether you are a BJJ, MMA, or a wrestler, mastering this technique will improve your game and confidence on the mat. So what are you waiting for? Try out these tips and drills today and let us know how they work for you!

Heel Hook: A Lethal Leg-lock Submission
Apr 15, 2022
Table of Contents
Heel hooks were considered a forbidden technique in jiu-jitsu for years but now has become one of the most popular techniques to learn.
Many coaches refused to teach heel hooks in the past since they were dangerous and banned in most competitions. But thanks to professional grappling competitions like ADCC and EBI, they are gaining popularity again.
If you’re also a BJJ fanatic trying to excel in your game with this deadly submission, you came to the right place! Discover everything about the heel hook in this read, including its origin, how it works, and different ways to use it on the mats.
1.  What is a Heel Hook?
The heel hook is a powerful leg-based submission used in Jiu-Jitsu, martial arts, and Sambo, that forces an opponent to tap out. It mainly attacks the knee joint but also has the potential to severely damage the ankle.
The heel hook can affect multiple joints in the leg and is considered one of the most dangerous leg locks due to a high risk of injury. That’s why it is illegal to perform in many grappling competitions, even today, except in advanced Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Sambo.
The heel hook relies on the rotational force of the knee joint, unlike straight foot locks which hyperextend the joint beyond its normal range, forcing the knee to completely twist from its normal line of motion.
The heel hook can be used to improve one’s position, to pin the opponent, and also in self-defense a pain compliance technique.
1.1. How does it work?
The heel hook aims at twisting the foot either laterally or medially by using the heel. There are many variations of the heel hook, the most basic involves placing your legs around the opponent’s legs and holding his foot in the armpit on the same side.
The legs are used to control the opponent’s body movements while twisting the foot. The whole body is used to generate a twisting motion, which creates severe torque on the ankle. This technique exerts immense pressure on the ankle, hence, damaging the knee and the foot.
2.   The Origin of Heel Hook
The heel hook submission originated 1000 years ago, just like most of our modern-day martial arts techniques.
Ancient Greece had one of the first types of grappling where the heel hook was portrayedin the culture’s artwork. The popular Pankration and its technological advancements were adopted by Roman culture, which absorbed many features of Ancient Greek social life.
Many Ancient Egypt Wrestling drawings illustrated a range of leg attacks, including the heel hook which predates Ancient Greece.
3.   The History of Heel Hook in BJJ
Although people have been practicing Heel Hook for centuries, its history in BJJ dates back to the 1960s.
There is a famous myth that “Ivan Gomes,” the renowned 1960s grappler, created the heel hook submission in BJJ. However, this claim was only supported by Carlson Gracie’s statement in an interview in which he said,
“The heel hook we use today was created by Ivan” – Carlson Gracie.
In 1990 after the demise of Ivan Gomes, Jose Gomes, his younger brother, stated that:
“The heel hook existed before us. It came through Japanese that landed here in Northeast Brazil. Our coach learned it from Takeo Yano, who was a great fighter.”
Ivan Gomes was probably the first fighter to bring attention to heel hooks in Brazil. However, Takeo Yano was the one who mainly disseminated BJJ and heel hook in the northeast region of Brazil in the early 20th century.
4.   Use of Heel hook in Jiu Jitsu Sport
For many years, leg locks like heel hooks were considered a cheap way to win in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
In the 1970s, when Jiu-Jitsu  started taking the form of a sport, many top instructors in Rio de Janeiro gathered together to make the rules for BJJ Sport. They devised a point system as well as a restriction book, stating which moves were banned, including the heel hook.
These rules imposed a stigma on the use of heel hooks and for years, this technique was frowned upon in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It was believed that a person would only use this technique if he was not smart enough to guard properly.
In the modern era, mixed martial arts, such as Sambo and Submission Wrestling, played a major role in revolutionizing the heel hook.
In the late 1990s, heel hooks slowly made their way back to the sport once Jiu-Jitsuopened its doors to foreign competitors. Dean Lister and John Danaher were among the first grapplers who popularized the use of heel hooks in BJJ.
Later on, heel hooks became prominent when IBJJF allowed their use in No-Gi competitions (for brown and black belts only) promoted by ADCC, NAGA, and many others. In 2021, the revival of the platform “Submission Only” pushed the concept of heel hook even further.
5.  How to perform a basic heel hook?
The best way to perform a basic heel hook is to first form the position, then lock your legs around the opponent’s legs, and then switch to the heel. For your convenience, the step by step instruction is given below:
The key to performing a heel hook is to control the opponent’s leg. If you fail to establish control of the leg before twisting the heel, you won’t be able to get the submission.
There are many ways to control your competitor’s leg, but they all follow the same principle i.e. “to control the leg above the knee.” Moreover, your hips must align with your opponent while doing so.
The next step is to bend your competitor’s leg at an angle where you can perform the heel hook.
Go for his/her  heel after gaining leg control.Turn your body towards his/her  heel, use the blade of your forearm to hook it so that it’s tight, and apply pressure by running towards your back shoulder.
6.  Types of Heel Hook
There are two main variations of heel hook in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: inside and outside heel hook. They mainly differ in  the leg entanglement used to secure the opponent’s legs.
It is important to have solid control of your opponent’s knee line for each  type of heel hook. This is achieved by pinching your knees together around your competitor’s thigh above the knee level.
Such control ensures that your rotational force is being applied directly to the knee, without allowing his/her hips to move and absorb the force.
6.1. Outside Heel Hook
Outside heel hook can be performed with traditional Asha Garami leg entanglements. The term outside means that your opponent’s heels are rotated away from the body.
In this case, instead of hooking over your opponent’s ankle, you need to weave your elbow crook behind your opponent’s heel while controlling his toes in your armpit on the same side.
Once you have locked this position, bridging into your opponent’s knees will produce an enormous rotational force on the knee, along with a deadly finish.
6.2. Inside Heel Hook
The inside heel hook is a similar move performed by holding your competitor’s foot in the opposite armpit and twisting it laterally.
Also known as the reverse or inverted heel hook, this variation is considered the most deadly of all heel hooks as it allows the attacker to isolate movement in the tibiofemoral joint, unlike the outside heel hook.
The term inside means that your opponent’s heels are rotated towards his/her body.
For the inside heel hook, you need to control your opponent’s heel with your elbow pit and pinch down on his/her toes with your lats and upper arm.
Once you have locked this position, gentle bridging with your hips will apply the rotational force directly to your competitor’s knee, rotating the heels inwards towards the body.
7.   Primary Heel Hook Positions
Assuming a good position is as important as performing the heel hook itself. Coaches often go by the saying, “position before submission.”
There are many types of leg entanglements, but the primary relevant positions and their corresponding heel hooks are given below:
7.1 Ashi Garami
Ashi Garami is the most important and basic leg lock position which attacks the opponent’s legs by using joint locks. In this position, the aim is to pin the opponent by extending his/her  leg or foot.
Ashi Garami position is ideal for performing an outside heel hook when your opponent is attacking and has  his/her heels exposed.
7.2 Leg Triangle or Honey Hole (4/11)
The honey hole, 4/11, and leg triangle are all different variations of the same leg entanglement. In this case, your front leg is placed over your opponent’s leg and your back leg is kept behind your opponent’s thigh, isolating the target leg.
These positions are ideal for performing the inside heel hook.
7.3 50/50
50/50 is a position in which your inside legs are intertwined  with your opponent’s inside legs, putting you both in the same position. Hence, you are both vulnerable to the same attack.
8.  How dangerous are Heel Hooks?
The heel hook is arguably the most dangerous submission hold as it can isolate the femur and rotate the tibia beyond its normal range of motion. Moreover, it directly attacks the ligaments, which have fewer sensory receptors compared to other body structures.
This twisting technique not only damages the ligaments in the knee but also ligaments in the foot, causing sudden dorsal pain in the knee, pelvis, and thighs.
If too much pressure is applied, it can tear the MCL, ACL, and LCL ligaments in the knee, destroying almost everything below the hip.
(MCL: Medial Collateral Ligament: connects thigh bone to shin bone on the inside of the knee, ACL: Anterior Cruciate Ligament: connects the femur to the tibia, and LCL: Lateral Collateral Ligament: connects the fibula to thigh bone).
9.  When to add Heel Hooks in your game?
The heel hook is an advanced move that is mostly performed by only experienced grapplers with a comprehensive understanding of the technique.
However, all grapplers should have a basic understanding of leg attacks including the heel hook, regardless of the belt color. Many gyms teach leg attacks after a student achieves a specific proficiency level for safety reasons. Therefore, it is advisable to add this technique to your repertoire after completing the proper training.
Whether you’re a gi or no-gi player, the proper use of this submission will surely help you to immobilize your opponent and cause him enormous pain.
10. Tips for performing Heel Hook
While performing the heel hook, it is imperative to focus on your technique by keeping in mind the following tips.

You’ve probably heard the phrase that states the best defense is a good offense. That phrase rings true in the sport of wrestling, in which counters and defensive maneuvers can help win a match. If your defense is good enough, you’ll force your opponent into desperate situations and errors, turning their haste and ineffectiveness into instant offense for you. There are several defensive wrestling moves every wrestler should know in order to be better prepared for a match. Check out CoachUp’s handy tips on defensive wrestling moves and techniques, and take your newly found knowledge to the mat!
STANCE
Your defensive wrestling position is extremely important and can affect the outcome of a match. Use your hands, arms, head, and waist to defend your position. Try to effectively use your hands to fight off any attack, pushing back any body part that comes your way by controlling one or both of the opponent’s hands via the wrists. Use your head to block an opponent trying to tie up with you. Keep your hips back when in your stance, this will allow you a better range of motion and a suitable solution when a rapid reaction is needed. Work on strengthening your core muscles so that you will have a more stable wrestling stance.
SPRAWLING
Sprawling is an effective defense against opponents trying to go for a leg take-down. The first thing you should do when an opponent shoots at you is to drive your legs back as far as possible. You should land on the upper back of your opponent and drive your hips down. If your opponent grabs one or both of your legs before you can get away, keep driving your hips down, this cannot be said enough. Your opponent will begin to flatten out and loosen his grip. If that is the case, you can turn your defensive position into an offensive one by getting behind your opponent. Sprawling is an athletic move and one of the best defensive wrestling maneuvers you can learn to defend from leg attacks.
SIDE ROLL When your opponent has a hold of you from above, a good way to escape or counter is the side roll. Grab your opponent’s wrist and pull it across your waist. Use your other arm to reach out and secure your opponent’s arm above the elbow. Pull your opponent’s arm and turn your body so that your he or she loses balance and lands next to you. This move is best when it’s a surprise, so use it with caution. Your opponent might be expecting it if you try it right at the referee’s whistle, a good wrestler will make sure they’re not predictable.

Huddle Up
Try asking your wrestling coach for more advanced defensive wrestling techniques and counter moves.

Headlocks
Headlocks are fundamental moves in wrestling that allow you to gain control over your opponent by immobilizing their head. There are different types of headlocks you can utilize depending on your position and the situation.
Front Headlock
The front headlock is a versatile move that can be used to control your opponent from the front. By wrapping your arm around their head, you can apply pressure and restrict their movement. This move is great for setting up takedowns and transitions to other techniques.
Rear Headlock
In the rear headlock, you position yourself behind your opponent and wrap your arm around their head, similar to the front headlock. This move gives you control and allows you to manipulate your opponent’s body. It’s particularly effective for takedowns and keeping your opponent off-balance.
Side Headlock
The side headlock is a valuable move that allows you to control your opponent’s head from the side. By wrapping your arm around their head, you can exert pressure and limit their options. This move is commonly used to set up throws and transitions into other moves.
Takedowns
Takedowns are essential wrestling moves that help you bring your opponent to the ground and gain a positional advantage. These moves require strength, technique, and timing to execute effectively.
Double Leg Takedown
The double leg takedown is one of the most powerful moves in wrestling. It involves driving your shoulder into your opponent’s midsection while simultaneously wrapping your arms around their legs. Using your momentum, you can lift and drive them to the ground, gaining control and potentially scoring points.
Single Leg Takedown
The single leg takedown is a technique that involves targeting one of your opponent’s legs and taking them down to the ground. By gripping their leg and using your bodyweight, you can destabilize your opponent and bring them down while maintaining control.
High Crotch Takedown
The high crotch takedown is another effective move that focuses on securing control of your opponent’s upper body while targeting their leg. By stepping in and connecting your hands under your opponent’s thigh, you can lift and drive them off-balance, ultimately bringing them down to the ground.
Pinning Techniques
Pinning techniques are vital in wrestling as they enable you to immobilize your opponent and secure a win. These moves require both technique and strength to execute correctly.
Cradle
The cradle is a powerful pinning technique that involves rolling your opponent onto their back, securing their head and leg, and controlling their body. This move puts pressure on the opponent’s neck and back, making it difficult for them to escape while allowing you to control the match.
Half Nelson
The half nelson is a classic wrestling move that uses leverage to control your opponent’s upper body. By wrapping your arm under their arm and wrist, you can exert pressure, rotate their body, and potentially pin them to the mat.
Guillotine
The guillotine is a pinning technique that focuses on applying pressure to your opponent’s neck. By trapping their head between your arms and squeezing, you restrict their movement and immobilize them on the ground. This move is often used to transition into other pinning techniques or set up submissions.
Armbar
The armbar is a versatile move that can be used for both pinning and submissions. By controlling your opponent’s arm and leveraging your bodyweight, you can apply pressure to their joint, potentially forcing a submission or securing a pin.
Escapes
Escapes are crucial skills for wrestlers to develop as they allow you to break free from unfavorable positions and regain control of the match.
Stand-Up Escape
The stand-up escape is one of the most basic and effective escapes in wrestling. It involves getting to your feet from a grounded position while maintaining distance and preventing your opponent from controlling you. This escape is particularly useful when you’re on the bottom and need to escape and score points.
Switch Escape
The switch escape is a technique that allows you to quickly reverse your position when your opponent has gained control. By using a combination of hip movement and explosiveness, you can turn the tables and break free from your opponent’s hold.
Granby Roll
The Granby Roll is a dynamic escape that involves rolling out of your opponent’s control and quickly regaining a favorable position. By using your momentum and flexibility, you can evade your opponent’s grasp and potentially set up a counterattack.
Reversals
Reversals are moves that allow you to transition from a disadvantageous position to a position of control. These techniques require timing, technique, and the ability to capitalize on your opponent’s movements.
Peterson Roll
The Peterson Roll is a reversal move where you roll through and take control of your opponent while they are trying to secure a takedown or maintain top position. By using your opponent’s momentum against them, you can surprise them and gain control.
Switch Reversal
The switch reversal is a technique used when your opponent has gained control of you from the top position. By swiftly changing your hips and positioning, you can catch your opponent off-guard and reverse the situation, potentially earning points in the process.
Hip Heist
The hip heist is a fundamental reversal move that allows you to escape from the bottom position and gain control over your opponent. By using explosive hip movement and footwork, you can quickly reverse the situation and regain your position in the match.
Throws
Throws are powerful techniques that involve using leverage, speed, and momentum to lift and manipulate your opponent, ultimately bringing them to the ground.
Fireman’s Carry
The fireman’s carry is a popular throw that requires strength and timing. By securing your opponent’s arm and wrapping your arm around their neck, you can lift and carry them over your shoulder, taking them off-balance and driving them to the ground.
Head and Arm Throw
The head and arm throw is a classic move in wrestling. It involves securing your opponent’s head and arm, using your body leverage to lift and rotate them through the air, and forcefully bringing them down to the ground.
Suplex
The suplex is a high-impact throw that involves lifting your opponent off the ground and throwing them over your shoulder while maintaining control. This move requires strength and technique to execute properly and can be a game-changer in a wrestling match.
Clinches
Clinches are positions in wrestling where two opponents are close together and vying for control. These positions often determine the outcome of a match and can be used to set up takedowns and other techniques.
Double Underhook
The double underhook clinch is a position where both of your arms are securely wrapped around your opponent’s upper body, underneath their arms. This grip allows you to control their movement and potentially set up takedowns or throws.
Over-Under
The over-under clinch involves having one arm positioned over your opponent’s shoulder while the other arm is positioned under their armpit. This grip gives you control over their upper body and can be used to set up takedowns or transitions to other moves.
Pummeling
Pummeling is a technique used in the clinch to establish control and gain advantageous positions. It involves exchanging underhooks and overhooks with your opponent, vying for better control and positioning.
Inside Tie
The inside tie involves controlling your opponent’s arm and neck from the inside position. By gripping their arm and using your forearm to control their head, you can limit their movement and potentially set up takedowns or transitions.
Outside Tie
The outside tie is the opposite of the inside tie and involves controlling your opponent’s arm and neck from the outside position. By positioning your arm across their body and using your forearm to control their head, you can manipulate their movement and potentially set up takedowns or transitions.
Collar Tie
The collar tie is a common pummeling technique that involves controlling your opponent’s head and neck by gripping their collar or the back of their neck. This grip allows you to manipulate their movements and create openings for takedowns or throws.
Sprawls
Sprawls are defensive moves used to counter your opponent’s takedown attempts. These techniques involve quickly dropping your hips and sprawling your legs backward, causing your opponent to lose their positioning and giving you an advantage.
Front Sprawl
The front sprawl is a defensive move used when your opponent shoots in for a takedown. By quickly dropping your hips and extending your legs backward, you can effectively block your opponent’s takedown attempt and maintain your position.
Whizzer Sprawl
The whizzer sprawl is a variation of the sprawl that involves utilizing a whizzer grip to counter your opponent’s takedown attempt. By securing their arm and using your hips to rotate, you can create a powerful counterforce and maintain control over the situation.
Pin Escapes
Pin escapes are crucial techniques used to escape from being pinned to the mat. These moves require technique, timing, and the ability to create leverage.
Bridge and Roll
The bridge and roll is a classic escape technique that involves bridging your hips off the mat and rolling your opponent over your shoulder to escape their control. By utilizing your core strength and explosive movement, you can break free from a pinning position and potentially reverse the match.
Hip Heist
The hip heist, as mentioned earlier, is not only a reversal move but also an effective escape technique. By explosively turning your hips and creating distance, you can escape from being pinned and regain a more advantageous position.
In conclusion, these basic wrestling moves provide a solid foundation for beginners to develop their skills and strategies on the mat. It’s important to practice and master these techniques to become a well-rounded wrestler capable of executing various moves and adapting to different situations. So, keep training, focus on proper technique, and always strive to improve your wrestling abilities. Good luck!

There are many ways ...","10 Wrestling Moves And Techniques You Should Master
Wrestling is one of the most popular martial arts worldwide, and it’s been around as far back as 3000 BC. It’s a grappling-based martial art that focuses on putting your opponent on the ground, controlling their body, and pinning them.
Wrestling is also an effective martial art for self-defense, and many view it as one of the best bases for mixed martial arts – the most permissive combat sport in the world that allows many of the techniques you might have to deal with in self-defense situations.
There are countless techniques used in wrestling, with some being more effective than others. This article will examine some of the most effective wrestling moves and techniques you should master. Many of these techniques carry over to other grappling-based martial arts like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and Judo.
Ten Wrestling Moves You Should Master
Ready to improve your wrestling skills? Let’s dive right into our list of techniques you should master:
1) The Penetration Step
The penetration step is the foundation for many takedowns used in wrestling like the single and double leg takedown. The technique is performed to put you in a position to grab onto your opponent and take them to the canvas.
Any competent wrestling school gets their students to drill this technique regularly unless the rules of the specific wrestling style forbid takedowns that target the leg, as is the case with Greco-Roman wrestling.
Practice the penetration step often until it becomes part of your muscle memory so you can execute the technique smoothly and quickly. The technique starts in your stance with your lead leg slightly in front of your rear foot and your torso a little bit bent at your hips.
Here’s how to perform the penetration step:
2) The Single-Leg Takedown
The single-leg takedown is one of the most commonly used techniques in wrestling, and that’s because it’s highly effective. There are several variations of the single-leg takedown, but they all involve targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and dragging them to the ground. There’s also the high crotch – commonly known as the hi-C single-leg technique that involves targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and using the hold to pick them off the ground and throw them to the floor.
The high single-leg takedown is the easiest type of single-leg attack to learn since you don’t need to perform a penetration step before shooting in on your opponent’s leg
Here’s how to perform a conventional high single-leg takedown:
Here’s how to complete a conventional single-leg takedown
Figure out which single-leg attacks work best for you and incorporate them into your wrestling game. These techniques are highly effective in wrestling settings and other grappling arts like BJJ.
3) Double-Leg Takedown
Double-leg takedowns are another popular technique used in wrestling. It’s a more interesting technique than the single leg, as it involves rapidly changing levels and exploding forward into your opponent. There are many ways to set up double-leg takedowns, like head snaps, hand ties, and misdirection.
These techniques are more effective when you catch your opponent with both legs close to each other, allowing you to wrap and lock your arms around them.
Shooting in is the building block for many wrestling takedowns, including double-leg techniques. Drill it frequently when you train to make your takedowns more effective. The faster and smoother your penetration step is, the more likely you’ll be able to complete takedowns when you shoot for them.
Here’s how to perform a double-leg takedown:
4) Sprawl
Sprawling is one of the fundamental defensive techniques used in wrestling, and it’s effective at all levels. Takedowns like the single leg and double leg involve wrapping your legs around your opponent’s legs to complete, but sprawling moves your legs out of your opponent’s legs and forces them to carry your weight. Your hand, head, and hips are your first line of defense against takedowns and holds, but you can always sprawl when all that fails.
Here’s how to perform a proper sprawl:
5) Snap-Down
The snap-down is a simple technique that puts you in the top turtle position. The best time to go for it is when your opponent is hunched over as they try to defend against incoming attacks. At that point, there’s nothing to stop their forward posture from crashing.
It’s a popular technique with freestyle wrestlers. Grapplers from other grappling styles, like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, are equally fond of it.
Here are the mechanics of the snap-down:
Besides being a simple way to end up in the top turtle position, snap-downs also open up your takedowns since both techniques require your opponent to do opposing things to defend against them. Your opponent needs to move their legs away from you to defend against takedowns which opens them up to the snap-down. Conversely, your opponent must pull their torso backward to defend against the snap down, leaving them vulnerable to takedown attempts.
6) Whizzer
The whizzer is another effective defensive move that all wrestlers should master. When you’re not in a position to sprawl out of a takedown attempt, the whizzer is your next line of defense. The technique involves securing a deep overhook on your opponent’s nearest hand as they try to complete a takedown.
Securing a whizzer puts lots of pressure on your opponent’s shoulder, and that’s often enough to discourage them from completing takedowns. You can also use the whizzer to drive your opponent to the ground in a half-nelson by wrapping your free hand around their neck, or you can execute a hip toss.
7) Switch
The switch is one of the fundamental techniques used to reverse disadvantageous positions in wrestling. A completed switch puts you in a dominant position or gets you back to your feet. Unlike escapes which only earn you a point in a wrestling match, reversals like the switch get you two points.
Here’s how to perform the technique:
8) Sit-Out
The sit-out is another fundamental defensive technique you can use to escape from bottom positions. At times, you can also use the technique to drag your opponent to the bottom.
Here’s what the mechanics look like:
9) Front-Quarter Nelson
The front-quarter nelson is a handy wrestling technique that carries over into other grappling arts. It’s an effective way to transition to a dominant position after stuffing an opponent’s takedown attempt with a sprawl.
To perform a front-quarter nelson:
10)  Chicken Wing (Armbar)
The chicken wing is one of the most uncomfortable things you can do to your opponent from top position. It’s also one of the most reliable holds for wearing down opponents and pinning them. Also known as the armbar in wrestling, the chicken wing gives your multiple options once you’ve secured the hold.
Here’s what the technique looks like:

Winning Wrestling Strategy: Proven Tips and Techniques for Success
Wrestling is a fast-paced, physically demanding sport that involves strength, technique, and mental fortitude. It’s a contest of wills, with competitors attempting to outmaneuver and outpower their opponents on the mat. To succeed in wrestling, one must develop a winning plan considering all sports facets. This post will look at tried-and-true ideas and techniques to help prospective wrestlers succeed on the mat.
Understand the Fundamentals
Understanding the fundamentals of wrestling is critical before moving on to more sophisticated moves and schemes. Understanding the posture, footwork, and various holds and takedowns are all part of this. A solid foundation is vital for any wrestler since it is the base for more sophisticated techniques later on. Concentrate on refining your stance, keeping balance, and performing basic techniques properly.
Physical and mental conditioning
Wrestling necessitates a high level of physical condition as well as mental fortitude. Strength training, conditioning, and flexibility exercises should all be included in physical training. Wrestling workouts should focus on muscles used during matches, such as the core, legs, and shoulders.
Mental preparation is also crucial. Developing mental fortitude and attention is essential for dealing with competitive circumstances. Visualization, meditation, and positive self-talk are all techniques that can help you improve your mental grit and confidence on the mat.
Research Your Opponent
Understanding your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses is essential to any winning plan. Analyze their moves and trends by watching videos of their prior bouts. Understanding their playing style can help you design a counter-strategy and attack their weaknesses during the game.
Adaptability is Critical
Adaptability is essential in wrestling. Each opponent is unique, and each match may have its problems. Prepare to modify your plan in response to your opponent’s actions and reactions. Maintain vigilance and be prepared to alter your strategy if the initial method fails to produce the desired results.
Concentrate on Positioning
Positioning is crucial in wrestling, and the wrestler who controls the postures has an advantage. Maintaining a decent stance, precise hand placement, and hip position during a match can give you a significant advantage. Improve your level shifts and footwork to control the center of the mat successfully.
Develop a Powerful Top Game
The first position provides a fantastic opportunity to earn points and exert control over your opponent. Concentrate on honing your riding skills with various tilts, turns, and pinning combinations. Not only will this help you score points, but it will also demoralize your opponent by exhibiting dominance.
Perform well in Escapes and Reversals.
It is critical in wrestling to escape or reverse from the bottom position. Experiment with various escape strategies to restore a neutral position or to gain the upper hand over your opponent. The ability to change a disadvantaged position into an advantageous one during a match can result in a dramatic shift in momentum.
Create a Diverse Takedown Arsenal
In wrestling, takedowns are the most common way to score points. Practice a variety of takedowns, including single legs, double legs, high crotches, and throws. A varied takedown arsenal keeps your opponents guessing and prevents them from anticipating your moves.
Strategy Implementation During Live Drilling
Wrestling instruction would only be complete with live drills. It lets you practice your moves against a resistive opponent, replicating real-world match scenarios. Use this time to implement your new plans and experiment with new activities.
Maintain Adequate Nutrition and Hydration
A successful wrestling plan goes beyond the mat. For top performance, proper nutrition and hydration are essential. Feed your body a well-balanced meal with enough protein, carbs, and healthy fats. Stay hydrated before, during, and after practices and matches to reduce weariness and maximize your performance.
Learn from Failure
Losses are unavoidable in every sport, including wrestling. Instead of obsessing over defeats, turn them into learning experiences. Analyze what went wrong, identify areas for improvement, then try to address those flaws. Setbacks motivate the most successful wrestlers to push harder and become more excellent athletes.
Keep Consistency
Wrestling success requires Consistency in training and attention to your goals. Regular practice and fitness will gradually lead to wrestler improvement and growth. Maintain dedication to your training program and objectives, and success will undoubtedly follow.
Wrestling success necessitates a diversified strategy. An effective wrestling strategy includes mastering the fundamentals, physical and mental training, observing opponents, adaptability, placement, and developing various tactics. Remember that wrestling is a never-ending learning process, and every encounter on the mat contributes to your development as an athlete. By adopting these tried-and-true tactics and techniques into your training and mindset, you’ll be well on your way to wrestling success. So, get into the ring with confidence, tenacity, and a winning strategy!

Understanding the Ring and Its Components
Before diving into wrestling techniques, it's important to understand the ring and its components. The ring is a circular mat that measures 32 feet in diameter and is surrounded by a circle of foam padding. The center of the ring is marked by a small circle, which is used to start the match.
The mat itself is made of durable material that provides traction for wrestlers while also providing a soft landing surface. The foam padding that surrounds the ring is designed to protect wrestlers from injury if they are thrown out of the ring. It's important to note that the foam padding is not considered part of the ring, so wrestlers must stay within the boundaries of the mat in order to avoid being disqualified.
In addition to the ring and its components, there are several other key elements to wrestling, including rules and regulations, scoring, and weight classes. Understanding these elements is crucial for success in wrestling, regardless of your skill level.
Basic Wrestling Techniques - Stance and Footwork
The foundation of wrestling is proper stance and footwork. A good stance is essential for balance and control, while proper footwork is crucial for movement and agility. Here's a breakdown of the basic wrestling stance and footwork:
Stance: The basic wrestling stance involves standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and weight evenly distributed between both feet. Your head should be up, your back straight, and your hands should be held in front of you, ready to grapple.
Footwork: In wrestling, footwork is used to create angles and set up takedowns. The most common footwork techniques include the slide step, the crossover step, and the pivot step. The slide step involves stepping forward with one foot and then sliding the other foot forward to maintain your stance. The crossover step involves crossing one foot over the other and then stepping forward to create an angle. Finally, the pivot step involves pivoting on one foot to create an angle and then stepping forward with the other foot.
By mastering these basic techniques, you'll be well on your way to becoming a skilled wrestler.
Takedowns - Single Leg, Double Leg, High Crotch, and More
Takedowns are a key component of wrestling and involve taking your opponent down to the mat while maintaining control. There are several types of takedowns, including the single leg, double leg, and high crotch, among others. Here's a breakdown of each takedown:
Single Leg: The single leg takedown involves grabbing one of your opponent's legs and lifting it off the mat, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with one foot and reach down to grab your opponent's leg just above the ankle. Pull their leg towards you while pushing them off balance with your other hand, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.
Double Leg: The double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent's legs and lifting them off the mat, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with both feet and reach down to grab both of your opponent's legs just above the ankles. Pull their legs towards you while pushing them off balance with your hands, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.
High Crotch: The high crotch takedown involves grabbing your opponent's leg and lifting it up to your side, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with one foot and reach down to grab your opponent's leg just above the knee. Lift their leg up to your side, while at the same time pushing them off balance with your other hand, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.
By mastering these takedowns and others, you'll be able to take control of your opponent and dominate the match.
Escapes and Reversals - Stand-Up, Sit-Out, and Granby Roll
Escapes and reversals are techniques used to get out of your opponent's grasp and regain control. There are several types of escapes and reversals, including the stand-up, sit-out, and Granby roll. Here's a breakdown of each technique:
Stand-Up: The stand-up escape involves standing up from the mat while breaking your opponent's hold. To execute this escape, turn towards your opponent and plant one hand on the mat while using your other hand to push off your opponent's grip. Then, stand up and turn to face your opponent.
Sit-Out: The sit-out escape involves sitting out from your opponent's grip and taking control of their back. To execute this escape, turn towards your opponent and plant one hand on the mat while using your other hand to grab their wrist. Then, sit out and take control of their back.
Granby Roll: The Granby roll is a reversal technique that involves rolling out of your opponent's grasp and taking control. To execute this reversal, tuck your head and roll towards your opponent's legs. As you roll, use your legs to push off the mat and spin around to take control.
By mastering these escapes and reversals, you'll be able to get out of tough situations and regain control of the match.
Pinning Combinations - Cradle, Half-Nelson, and Tilt
Pinning combinations are techniques used to pin your opponent to the mat for a win. There are several types of pinning combinations, including the cradle, half-nelson, and tilt. Here's a breakdown of each combination:
Cradle: The cradle is a pinning combination that involves locking your opponent's head and leg together. To execute this combination, reach across your opponent's body and grab their opposite wrist while at the same time grabbing their opposite knee.

Tilts,A set of techniques aimed at tilting the opponent's body for gaining control and potentially scoring points.,What techniques are effective for tilting an opponent's body in wrestling?,,,,,Score More Back Points With These Tilts - Fanatic Wrestling,https://fanaticwrestling.com/blogs/news/score-more-back-points-with-these-tilts,"A tilt is a move that is used in wrestling that turns an opponent and exposes their back, but usually does not lead to a pin. Here are three great tilts that you can use to help score more back points. Thread the Needle Roll Through Tilt by Logan Stieber. To set this tilt up, you must first get into a crossbody ride.","Score More Back Points With These Tilts
There are a lot of different turns you can hit in wrestling. The ultimate goal is to pin your opponent, but just turning someone to their back can really help you to rack up a lot of points during a match. A tilt is a move that is used in wrestling that turns an opponent and exposes their back, but usually does not lead to a pin. Here are three great tilts that you can use to help score more back points.
Thread the Needle Roll Through Tilt by Logan Stieber
To set this tilt up, you must first get into a crossbody ride. Watch how Stieber bumps his partner forward and blocks the arm so he can slide the leg in. After he gets the leg in and transitions to the crossbody ride, he hunts for the far arm and scoops it up at the elbow. When the guy on bottom feels their arm getting hooked, their automatic response is to grab their own thigh to prevent it from being pulled out.
When the bottom guy grabs their own thigh, the guy on top needs to slide his arm out just a little then with the back arm, reach through his opponent’s legs to grab the wrist is locked onto the thigh. Once the wrist is secured, the top guy is going to roll. Guy on top needs to roll over their front shoulder. While the roll is happening, top guy needs to turn his head and look back behind himself. To generate the power to make the roll happen, the top guy is going to use the leg that is not hooked in to push off the mat then kick it to create momentum.
After the roll through, keep the elbow and wrist locked up tight and keep the leg hooked. Just as with any tilt position, the guy will be trying to fight off his back, so the top guy needs to make adjustments to keep him on his back. The tighter the top guy can keep the bottom guy the better.

Wrist Roll Tilt With Ed Ruth
To hit this tilt you must break your opponent down flat to the mat. Once flat, get wrist control on one side and drive to roll the wrist under and put it across the back like you are setting up a hammer lock. Watch how Ruth uses his whole body to create pressure to roll the wrist out.
After you have the wrist rolled out, place the hand on their low back but remember to not let the elbow bend past ninety degrees or the referee will stop the match for potentially dangerous. From here, watch how Ruth blocks and puts pressure on the elbow and uses it as a pivot point to turn his opponent.
Once the elbow is secured off the back and is being blocked with your knee, use your other hand to either hook in their armpit or you can reach across their neck almost like you have a claw ride. From here you will lift up then roll to your side for the turn.
When you have turned your opponent, be sure to keep everything very tight, especially the arm that is across the back. Also, pay attention to what Ruth is doing with his legs to control his opponent. This tilt, just like all tilts, rely on your ability to keep your opponent control long enough to get your five count and you must keep yourself out of danger as well.
Standing Tilt With Ben and Max Askren
This tilt is quite a bit different from the other tilts because it starts from a standing position. You see this position a lot after a guy has hit a standup but hasn’t actually escaped. To set this tilt up, you will need to lock up a two on one; one hand controlling their elbow and the other reaching around the body to control the wrist of the same arm.  In the video, pay attention to how Max drops his head down to the side and puts his elbow one the inside of the leg and circles down and rolls.
When he brings him down to the mat, he is landing with his elbow and his knee connected. They way he holds onto the tilt is different than how you would normally hold onto a two on one tilt so be sure to make note of it when you watch the video.
This tilt is a great move to have in your back pocket if you are down late in a match and need to score some points to win.
Tilts are a great way to score a lot of points, especially in college with a four point near fall. Be sure to drill these tilts and refer back to the videos if you find yourself confused.

Wrestling Techniques
Wrestling techniques encompass various skills and maneuvers that wrestlers employ to gain control over their opponents, score points, and ultimately achieve victory. These techniques are essential elements of the sport and serve as the foundation for a wrestler’s success.
Wrestling techniques can be broadly categorized into two main categories: takedowns and escapes. Each category serves a distinct purpose and plays a crucial role in the overall strategy of a wrestler.
Takedowns
Takedowns involve offensive maneuvers to bring an opponent from a standing position to the mat. The primary objective of takedowns is to gain control over the opponent and earn points. Takedowns require a combination of technique, timing, strength, and agility.
Various takedown techniques exist, including single-leg takedowns, double-leg takedowns, high crotch takedowns, fireman’s carry, ankle pick, and head and arm throw. Mastering takedowns allow wrestlers to effectively initiate the action, take control of the match, and put their opponents on the defensive.
Escapes
Escapes are defensive techniques to break free from an opponent’s control and regain a neutral or advantageous position. When a wrestler finds themselves in a compromised position, such as being underneath an opponent or being controlled on the mat, escapes become crucial for regaining control and avoiding potential points scored by the opponent.
Escapes require quickness, flexibility, and tactical awareness. Common escape techniques include the sit-out, Granby roll, switch, Peterson roll, standing switch, and hip heist. Developing strong escape skills allows wrestlers to recover from disadvantageous positions, neutralize their opponents’ control, and potentially score their own points.
Both takedowns and escapes are vital components of a wrestler’s skill set. The ability to proficiently execute takedowns allows a wrestler to dictate the flow of the match, take their opponents off balance, and score valuable points.
Conversely, solid escape skills empower wrestlers to break free from an opponent’s control, reverse the momentum, and regain a position of advantage.
Takedowns Examined
When it comes to basic takedown techniques in wrestling, there are several fundamental moves that wrestlers should focus on mastering.
One such technique is the single-leg takedown, which involves attacking one of the opponent’s legs, securing it with both arms and driving through to complete the takedown. This move relies on proper positioning and explosive power to successfully execute.
Another essential takedown technique is the double-leg takedown. This move is known for its power and effectiveness. In a double-leg takedown, the wrestler reaches behind the opponent’s knees with both arms, driving forward to lift them off the ground and take them down to the mat. It requires good timing, coordination, and the ability to generate force with the lower body.
Moving on to advanced takedown techniques, one prominent move is the fireman’s carry. This dynamic technique requires the wrestler to hook an arm over the opponent’s shoulder, grab the opposite leg, and lift them onto their back for a takedown. It is an explosive move that requires coordination, strength, and precise execution.
Another advanced takedown technique is the ankle pick. This technique involves quickly grabbing the opponent’s ankle, lifting it while driving forward to off-balance them, and ultimately taking them down. It requires speed, agility, and the ability to anticipate and exploit openings in the opponent’s defense.
Escapes Examined
Regarding basic escape techniques in wrestling, there are a few fundamental moves that wrestlers should focus on mastering. One such technique is the sit-out. This escape involves quickly rotating on the mat to face the opponent and escape their control. Executing effectively requires hip movement, proper hand placement, and explosive power.
Another essential escape technique is the Granby roll. This rolling maneuver utilizes momentum and body rotation to escape from the bottom position. Wrestlers typically execute the Granby roll by rolling over the shoulder or the head, using their agility and timing to evade their opponent’s control and regain a more advantageous position.
The switch is another basic escape technique that wrestlers should learn. This technique involves changing directions while on the mat to escape an opponent’s control. It allows the wrestler to transition from a defensive position to a potentially advantageous position by utilizing quickness and strategic movement.
One notable move on to advanced escape techniques is the Peterson roll. This dynamic role requires the wrestler to counter an opponent’s pressure by utilizing leverage and momentum to execute a controlled roll and escape. It demands high technical skill and awareness of the opponent’s positioning.
Another advanced escape technique is the standing switch. This move allows the wrestler to escape from the bottom position while standing, using quickness, precise footwork, and timing. The wrestler aims to swiftly switch positions with the opponent, gaining an advantage.

Understanding the Ring and Its Components
Before diving into wrestling techniques, it's important to understand the ring and its components. The ring is a circular mat that measures 32 feet in diameter and is surrounded by a circle of foam padding. The center of the ring is marked by a small circle, which is used to start the match.
The mat itself is made of durable material that provides traction for wrestlers while also providing a soft landing surface. The foam padding that surrounds the ring is designed to protect wrestlers from injury if they are thrown out of the ring. It's important to note that the foam padding is not considered part of the ring, so wrestlers must stay within the boundaries of the mat in order to avoid being disqualified.
In addition to the ring and its components, there are several other key elements to wrestling, including rules and regulations, scoring, and weight classes. Understanding these elements is crucial for success in wrestling, regardless of your skill level.
Basic Wrestling Techniques - Stance and Footwork
The foundation of wrestling is proper stance and footwork. A good stance is essential for balance and control, while proper footwork is crucial for movement and agility. Here's a breakdown of the basic wrestling stance and footwork:
Stance: The basic wrestling stance involves standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and weight evenly distributed between both feet. Your head should be up, your back straight, and your hands should be held in front of you, ready to grapple.
Footwork: In wrestling, footwork is used to create angles and set up takedowns. The most common footwork techniques include the slide step, the crossover step, and the pivot step. The slide step involves stepping forward with one foot and then sliding the other foot forward to maintain your stance. The crossover step involves crossing one foot over the other and then stepping forward to create an angle. Finally, the pivot step involves pivoting on one foot to create an angle and then stepping forward with the other foot.
By mastering these basic techniques, you'll be well on your way to becoming a skilled wrestler.
Takedowns - Single Leg, Double Leg, High Crotch, and More

Wrestling is one of the most popular martial arts worldwide, and it’s been around as far back as 3000 BC. It’s a grappling-based martial art that focuses on putting your opponent on the ground, controlling their body, and pinning them.
Wrestling is also an effective martial art for self-defense, and many view it as one of the best bases for mixed martial arts – the most permissive combat sport in the world that allows many of the techniques you might have to deal with in self-defense situations.
There are countless techniques used in wrestling, with some being more effective than others. This article will examine some of the most effective wrestling moves and techniques you should master. Many of these techniques carry over to other grappling-based martial arts like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and Judo.
Ten Wrestling Moves You Should Master
Ready to improve your wrestling skills? Let’s dive right into our list of techniques you should master:
1) The Penetration Step
The penetration step is the foundation for many takedowns used in wrestling like the single and double leg takedown. The technique is performed to put you in a position to grab onto your opponent and take them to the canvas.
Any competent wrestling school gets their students to drill this technique regularly unless the rules of the specific wrestling style forbid takedowns that target the leg, as is the case with Greco-Roman wrestling.
Practice the penetration step often until it becomes part of your muscle memory so you can execute the technique smoothly and quickly. The technique starts in your stance with your lead leg slightly in front of your rear foot and your torso a little bit bent at your hips.
Here’s how to perform the penetration step:
2) The Single-Leg Takedown
The single-leg takedown is one of the most commonly used techniques in wrestling, and that’s because it’s highly effective. There are several variations of the single-leg takedown, but they all involve targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and dragging them to the ground. There’s also the high crotch – commonly known as the hi-C single-leg technique that involves targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and using the hold to pick them off the ground and throw them to the floor.
The high single-leg takedown is the easiest type of single-leg attack to learn since you don’t need to perform a penetration step before shooting in on your opponent’s leg
Here’s how to perform a conventional high single-leg takedown:
Here’s how to complete a conventional single-leg takedown
Figure out which single-leg attacks work best for you and incorporate them into your wrestling game. These techniques are highly effective in wrestling settings and other grappling arts like BJJ.
3) Double-Leg Takedown
Double-leg takedowns are another popular technique used in wrestling. It’s a more interesting technique than the single leg, as it involves rapidly changing levels and exploding forward into your opponent. There are many ways to set up double-leg takedowns, like head snaps, hand ties, and misdirection.
These techniques are more effective when you catch your opponent with both legs close to each other, allowing you to wrap and lock your arms around them.
Shooting in is the building block for many wrestling takedowns, including double-leg techniques. Drill it frequently when you train to make your takedowns more effective. The faster and smoother your penetration step is, the more likely you’ll be able to complete takedowns when you shoot for them.
Here’s how to perform a double-leg takedown:
4) Sprawl
Sprawling is one of the fundamental defensive techniques used in wrestling, and it’s effective at all levels. Takedowns like the single leg and double leg involve wrapping your legs around your opponent’s legs to complete, but sprawling moves your legs out of your opponent’s legs and forces them to carry your weight. Your hand, head, and hips are your first line of defense against takedowns and holds, but you can always sprawl when all that fails.
Here’s how to perform a proper sprawl:
5) Snap-Down
The snap-down is a simple technique that puts you in the top turtle position. The best time to go for it is when your opponent is hunched over as they try to defend against incoming attacks. At that point, there’s nothing to stop their forward posture from crashing.
It’s a popular technique with freestyle wrestlers. Grapplers from other grappling styles, like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, are equally fond of it.
Here are the mechanics of the snap-down:
Besides being a simple way to end up in the top turtle position, snap-downs also open up your takedowns since both techniques require your opponent to do opposing things to defend against them. Your opponent needs to move their legs away from you to defend against takedowns which opens them up to the snap-down. Conversely, your opponent must pull their torso backward to defend against the snap down, leaving them vulnerable to takedown attempts.
6) Whizzer
The whizzer is another effective defensive move that all wrestlers should master. When you’re not in a position to sprawl out of a takedown attempt, the whizzer is your next line of defense. The technique involves securing a deep overhook on your opponent’s nearest hand as they try to complete a takedown.
Securing a whizzer puts lots of pressure on your opponent’s shoulder, and that’s often enough to discourage them from completing takedowns. You can also use the whizzer to drive your opponent to the ground in a half-nelson by wrapping your free hand around their neck, or you can execute a hip toss.
7) Switch
The switch is one of the fundamental techniques used to reverse disadvantageous positions in wrestling. A completed switch puts you in a dominant position or gets you back to your feet. Unlike escapes which only earn you a point in a wrestling match, reversals like the switch get you two points.
Here’s how to perform the technique:
8) Sit-Out
The sit-out is another fundamental defensive technique you can use to escape from bottom positions. At times, you can also use the technique to drag your opponent to the bottom.

The most common wrestling escapes from the bottom position are Granby Roll, sucker drag, clear arm sucker drag, mule kick, beaking cradle, sitout hip heist, and Turtle roll. All these techniques help the wrestler to stand up or move away from an inferior position and gain control of the fight.
Bottom positions are the most dangerous positions in wrestling and thus escaping from them successfully is very important. These techniques help wrestlers to protect themselves against being pinned or put into submission holds. Wrestlers should always practice these techniques to improve their bottom game and increase their chances of winning matches.
Escaping from the bottom position is essential for a wrestler to be successful. Wrestlers should practice these moves regularly and understand the importance of being able to escape from inferior positions. With practice and dedication, these techniques can easily become second nature to the wrestler and make a big difference in their matches.
How Much is an Escape Worth in Wrestling?
In wrestling, an escape is worth one point. This means that if a wrestler escapes from the bottom position and stands up, they will be awarded one point. However, the wrestler must remain standing up in order to be successful and score the point. If they go back down or get put on a submission hold, the point will not be awarded.
Escape can be a crucial factor in deciding matches and can make the difference between winning and losing. It is important for a wrestler to have good technique when attempting to escape from the bottom position and be able to time it correctly in order to score the point.
What Wrestling Styles Benefit From Escaping?
All wrestling styles benefit from being able to escape from the bottom position. Greco-Roman and Freestyle wrestlers must be able to escape from inferior positions in order to score points and win matches.
In Folkstyle wrestling, escaping can help wrestlers avoid being put into submission holds or pinned and grant them time to get back in control of the match. Also, escaping can help wrestlers score points in Folkstyle matches, since they will be awarded one point if they escape from the bottom position and remain standing up.
How to Escape a Cradle in Wrestling?
To escape a cradle in wrestling, the wrestler must first turn their body away from the opponent. This will create space between them and make it easier to escape. The wrestler can then use their legs and arms to push off the opponent’s body, creating more space before standing up. This will help them escape the cradle and gain control of the match. The wrestler should also be aware of their opponent’s arms and make sure that they do not get caught in a submission hold.
Can I Practice Escapes at Home?
Yes, you can practice escapes at home. This is important for developing the muscle memory and technique necessary to escape from bad positions in wrestling.
You can practice by having someone hold you in a bad position, such as the bottom position, and then practicing escaping from it. You can also use objects, such as pillows and mats, to simulate the situation. It’s important to practice wrestling workouts at home to further improve your technique and condition yourself for the sport.

In the world of wrestling, defending against the leg ride is crucial for maintaining control, preventing scoring opportunities, and turning the tide in your favor. This article will delve into effective strategies for defending against the leg ride while exploring leg wrestling moves, wrestling leg rides, leg drops in wrestling, and the role of leg slaps in wrestling.
What this article covers:
1. Leg Wrestling Moves:
Leg wrestling moves encompass a variety of techniques that involve utilizing the legs to gain an advantage over your opponent. While defending against leg wrestling moves is important, understanding them can also inform your defensive strategies. Here are a couple of common leg wrestling moves:
a) Leg Lariat: The leg lariat is a powerful move where a wrestler jumps into the air, extending one leg to strike their opponent's upper body or head. When defending against this move, focus on evasive footwork, maintaining distance, and countering with quick counterattacks.b) Leg Whip: The leg whip involves forcefully swinging your opponent's leg in a lateral or circular motion. To defend against a leg whip, anticipate the movement, maintain a solid base, and utilize effective hand control to disrupt your opponent's grip and balance.

2. Wrestling Leg Rides:
Wrestling leg rides are techniques that aim to control and immobilize your opponent by utilizing their legs. Defending against leg rides requires a combination of skill, balance, and anticipation. Let's explore a couple of leg ride variations:a) Cross Body Ride: In the cross body ride, your opponent wraps their arm around your leg while maintaining a parallel position. To defend against this ride, focus on maintaining a strong base, utilizing hip and leg movement to disrupt your opponent's control, and countering with escapes or reversals.b) Spiral Ride: The spiral ride involves your opponent positioning themselves diagonally behind you, securing control of your leg and utilizing body positioning to maintain control. To defend against a spiral ride, focus on hand control, hip movement, and maintaining a solid base to prevent your opponent from establishing control and disrupting their balance.
3. Leg Drops in Wrestling:
Leg drops are impactful offensive moves that can catch you off guard and potentially lead to scoring points or even a pin. When defending against leg drops, consider the following strategies:a) Anticipate and React: Watch for cues and anticipate the leg drop, enabling you to react quickly and evade the strike. This can involve moving out of the way, utilizing evasive footwork, or countering with your own offensive techniques.b) Establish Solid Positioning: Maintain a strong base and solid balance to minimize the impact of a leg drop. By staying grounded and having a stable foundation, you can absorb the force of the leg drop more effectively.
4. Leg Slaps in Wrestling:
Leg slaps are techniques commonly used in professional wrestling, particularly in entertainment-based promotions, to enhance the impact of strikes or moves. While they don't directly relate to defending against leg rides, it's worth noting their purpose and effect. Leg slaps create a loud sound effect when a wrestler strikes their own thigh or leg, adding theatrics and engaging the audience.
Conclusion:
Defending against the leg ride in wrestling requires a combination of technique, anticipation, and solid positioning. By understanding leg wrestling moves, such as leg lariats and leg whips, you can better anticipate and counter your opponent's attacks. Meanwhile, familiarizing yourself with leg rides, such as the cross body ride and spiral ride, allows you to develop effective defensive strategies. Remember to maintain a strong base, utilize hand control, and employ quick reactions to counter leg drops effectively. While leg slaps are primarily associated with entertainment-based wrestling, they add an element of theatrics to the sport. By mastering defensive techniques andexpanding your arsenal, you can become a well-rounded wrestler capable of nullifying the leg ride and seizing control of the match.

Leg wrestling, also known as Indian leg wrestling, is a sport that has been gaining popularity in recent times. This unique form of wrestling tests the strength of the legs of two opponents as they struggle to push each other off balance.
What is leg wrestling? Leg wrestling is a sport in which two opponents sit facing each other with the soles of their feet touching. The contestants interlock their hands and then attempt to push their opponent’s foot backward using only their leg strength.
The first person to successfully force their opponent’s foot out of the way wins the match. Leg wrestling is often played for enjoyment and as a recreational rather than a competitive sport.
While leg wrestling may seem like a simple sport, there are a few techniques and rules to keep in mind to ensure a fair and exciting match.
In this guide, I will take a closer look at leg wrestling and provide you with everything you need to know to participate in this fun and challenging sport.
Why is it called Indian leg wrestling?
Indian leg wrestling is a variation of the sport that originated in India. It involves two people sitting on the ground with the soles of their feet touching. From there, the competitors push and pull in an effort to force the other person’s foot to the ground.
This version is sometimes called “butt-to-butt” wrestling, as the competitors sit on each other’s laps.
Indian leg wrestling is a type of arm wrestling, but instead of using hands, the two opponents lock their legs in a kneeling position.
The objective of the sport is to push the other person’s leg down and make them lose balance.
To begin, both opponents kneel opposite each other, lock their legs at the knees and grab each other’s ankles. At the same time, it may seem easy; like Sumo wrestling, leg wrestling requires strength and technique to win.
Indian leg wrestling techniques
There are several techniques that one can use during a leg wrestling match.
To become a skilled leg wrestler, one must focus on developing leg strength. Heavy resistance training, jumping, and plyometric exercises can help increase leg power.
In addition, one can also work on their speed and agility to react quickly to their opponent’s movements.
Training under a professional coach who can guide you on the proper techniques and rules is also essential.
A List of Leg Wrestling Rules
Leg wrestling, also known as Indian leg wrestling or leg scuffling, is a fun and exciting sport that has been around for generations. You need a list of rules to ensure you enjoy this game safely and fairly.
Here I will share a comprehensive list of leg wrestling rules that will make your game more enjoyable.
1. Setting Up The Game
The first step in leg wrestling is to place two competitors on the ground facing each other with the soles of their feet touching.
Each player’s position is crucial to the game’s success. Both players must sit upright, with their knees bent and their palms resting on the ground. They should also grip each other’s hands firmly.
2. The Timing
Leg wrestling is a game of endurance. It usually lasts for two rounds, each lasting a maximum of three minutes.
In between the rounds, there is a one-minute rest period. The competitor who wins both rounds or pins their opponent’s foot to the ground is declared the winner.
3. Rules of Engagement
Once the game begins, both competitors must keep their other leg straight and not touch each other with any other part of their body.
The game ends when one of the competitors manages to pin their opponent’s foot to the ground or if one of the players loses their grip. In case of a stalemate, the game may be declared a tie.
4. Fair Play
Leg wrestling is a game of strength, endurance, and technique. Both players must compete fairly and follow the rules of the game.
Any cheating, such as intentionally gripping your opponent’s wrist or arm, or using your free foot to push or block your opponent’s leg, is not allowed.
Players should compete to the best of their ability without resorting to foul play.
5. Safety Precautions
Safety is crucial, as with any competitive sport like Kickboxing and Muay Thai. To avoid injuries, players must be careful when setting up the game and during the game not to jerk their opponent’s arm or leg.
If you feel pain or discomfort during the game, immediately stop and seek medical attention if necessary.

Do you want to dominate your friends in a physical competition that doesn’t require any equipment, skills, or practice? Look no further than leg wrestling!
Now I’ll teach you how to play leg wrestling like a pro, from the basic rules to the winning techniques. Let’s get started!
Understanding the Basics
Leg wrestling is a simple game with a few important rules to follow.
Mastering the Techniques
Playing leg wrestling is about brute force, strategy, and balance.
There are several ways to get an advantage over your opponent, such as locking your foot tightly around theirs, leaning back to transfer your weight, or twisting your hips to generate more torque.
You can also fake a move to distract your rival and counter-attack when they least expect it. The key is to stay focused and react quickly to your opponent’s moves.
As you practice more, you’ll discover your signature techniques that work best for your body type.
Training your Legs
Of course, being physically fit and strong can give you an edge in leg wrestling.
While you don’t necessarily need bulging muscles to win, it helps to have trained legs that can endure the strain of the game.
Some exercises that can improve your leg stamina and power include squats, lunges, calf raises, and leg press.
You can also do some stretching and warm-up before the game to reduce the risk of injury. Just make sure not to overdo it and tire your legs before the match.
Challenging Your Friends
Now that you’re equipped with the knowledge and skills of leg wrestling, it’s time to put them to the test.
Challenge your friends, siblings, or co-workers to a match and see who is on top. Make it more interesting by betting on the outcome, such as treating the winner to a meal or a drink.
However, always remember to play fair and to respect the other person’s boundaries. Leg wrestling can be a rough game, but it doesn’t have to be violent or hurtful. Have fun, laugh, and enjoy the experience, win or lose.
Types of Leg Wrestling
Leg wrestling, also known as “Indian leg wrestling,” is a popular sport where two opponents face each other with the soles of their feet touching. This sport aims to push the opponent’s foot backward using only your leg strength.
Leg wrestling is an exciting and challenging sport that requires skill and strategy.
Here are some of the different types of leg wrestling.
1. Straight Leg Wrestling
Straight leg wrestling is the most common type of leg wrestling. The opponents sit on a mat facing each other and interlock their hands. Then, they extend their legs and place the soles of their feet together.
The objective is to force the opponent’s foot backward using only your leg strength. The person who successfully pushes their opponent’s foot out of the way wins the match.
2. Standing Leg Wrestling
Standing leg wrestling is another popular type of leg wrestling. In this type of leg wrestling, the opponents stand facing each other and interlock their hands. Then, they lift one leg and place the sole of their foot against their opponent’s.
The game’s objective is to knock your opponent off balance while maintaining your balance. The first person to lose their balance or touch the ground with any part of their body loses the game.
3. Blindfolded Leg Wrestling
Blindfolded leg wrestling adds a twist to the traditional leg wrestling game. In this version, the players are blindfolded and must rely on their sense of touch to win the game.
The opponents sit facing each other and interlock their hands. Then, they extend their legs and place the soles of their feet together.
The objective is to push the opponent’s foot backward using only your leg strength. Blindfolding the players adds an element of surprise and makes the game more challenging.
4. Partner Leg Wrestling
Partner leg wrestling is a fun and challenging game that requires coordination and teamwork. In this type of leg wrestling, two players work together to defeat another team of two. The opponents sit facing each other and interlock their hands.
Then, each player places the sole of their foot against the foot of the opposing team member. Working together, the partners attempt to push the opponent’s foot backward using only their leg strength.
5. Arm Wrestling with Legs
Arm wrestling with legs is a variation of leg wrestling where the opponents use their arms to grip each other’s legs instead of interlocking their hands.
The game involves the opponents sitting on the floor facing each other. They then grip each other’s legs at the ankles, with one hand placed on the other.
The game’s objective is to force your opponent’s ankle down using your arm strength.
How to play the wrestling leg-riding technique?
The leg riding technique is one of the most popular moves in leg wrestling.
How to win at leg wrestling?
Leg wrestling is all about leverage. It’s not necessarily about having the strongest legs but rather about using your opponent’s weight against them.
One tip is to keep your elbows locked into your body. This helps you apply more force and also prevents your opponent from getting a good grip on your hands.
Another tip is to practice your leg riding technique and focus on technique rather than brute force.
Is leg wrestling a sport?
Yes, leg wrestling is considered a sport. While it may not be as well-known as other sports like basketball or soccer, it is a legitimate competitive activity.
There are even leg wrestling competitions held around the world. One of the most famous competitions is the annual World Toe Wrestling Championship.
What is a double leg in wrestling?
A double leg in wrestling is a takedown move that involves grabbing both opponents’ legs and driving them down to the mat. This move is often used in freestyle and folkstyle wrestling and is considered one of the most effective ways to take down an opponent.
The key to executing a successful double leg is quickly and decisively driving forward after grabbing the opponent’s legs.

Leg Wrestling Rules: Exploring Strategies for Success
In the realm of combat sports, leg wrestling stands out as a distinctive and captivating competition that tests the strength, balance, and strategy of its participants.

As you embark on this journey of discovery, you’ll unravel the nuances of leg wrestling rules, uncover the techniques that define its matches, and gain insights into the intricate strategies employed by its athletes.
Navigating the Landscape of Leg Wrestling Rules
Commencement and Starting Positions
Leg wrestling matches commence with competitors seated face-to-face on the ground. Their legs are extended outward and their feet touch. This intimate contact forms the basis of the sport, where participants utilize their lower body strength and leverage to gain an upper hand.
Aiming for Victory
The ultimate objective in leg wrestling is to compel your opponent’s foot to touch the ground while keeping your own foot elevated. This requires a delicate balance of power, precision, and strategy. The first wrestler to achieve this feat secures victory in the match.
Hands Off the Ground
While participants begin with clasped hands, hands-off is the rule once the match is underway. Wrestlers are strictly forbidden from utilizing their hands to push or pull their opponent’s leg. This regulation emphasizes the reliance on lower body strength and maneuvering in this unique form of wrestling.

Leg wrestling is a popular sport that involves two opponents attempting to force each other’s legs to touch the ground. It requires not only strength but also strategy and technique. If you’re looking to dive into the world of leg wrestling and master the art of taking down your opponent, then you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we will guide you through seven essential steps to help you dominate your leg wrestling matches.
What is leg wrestling?
Leg wrestling is a competitive sport that focuses on the use of leg strength and technique to bring an opponent’s leg down to the ground. It requires agility, balance, and a solid grip to gain the upper hand in a match.
How important is strength in leg wrestling?
Strength plays a significant role in leg wrestling, as it allows you to exert force on your opponent’s leg. However, technique and strategy can often overcome pure strength. By utilizing the right moves and positioning, even a smaller opponent can take down a stronger adversary.
What are the basic rules of leg wrestling?
In leg wrestling, two opponents lie on their backs with their legs interlocked at the ankles. The objective is to force your opponent’s leg to the ground while keeping yours elevated. You win a match by successfully bringing your opponent’s leg down.
4. Step 1: Establish a strong base
To leg wrestle effectively, start by lying flat on your back with your upper body relaxed. Keep your legs extended and tighten your core muscles to create a solid base for balance and stability.
5. Step 2: Find a favorable grip
Grasp your opponent’s ankle firmly with both hands while keeping your elbows close to your body. Your grip should be strong yet flexible, allowing you to maintain control without losing your technique.
6. Step 3: Create leverage and use your hips
To gain an advantage, use your hips to generate leverage. Lift your hips slightly off the ground, allowing you to apply downward force on your opponent’s leg. This technique can put them on the defensive, making it harder for them to resist your maneuvers.
7. Step 4: Use quick and sudden movements
Leg wrestling is a fast-paced sport, and the element of surprise can be your greatest ally. Use sudden movements and quick shifts in direction to catch your opponent off guard. It will give you the element of surprise, making it harder for them to resist your attacks.
8. Step 5: Mind your balance and maintain control
While attempting to bring down your opponent’s leg, it’s crucial to maintain your own balance and control. Avoid becoming overly aggressive, as it can leave you vulnerable to counterattacks. Focus on maintaining a stable position and controlling your opponent’s movements.
9. Step 6: Use your opponent’s momentum against them
Exploit your opponent’s movements to your advantage. When they try to overpower you, use their momentum against them. Steer their leg in the direction they are pushing, subtly redirecting their force and hastening their downfall.
10. Step 7: Practice and assess your technique
Leg wrestling is a skill that demands practice and refinement. Regularly engage in training sessions and friendly matches to evaluate your technique and identify areas for improvement. Adapt and adjust your strategy based on the strengths and weaknesses of different opponents.
Leg wrestling is an exciting and challenging sport that engages both the body and the mind. By following these seven steps, you can develop a strong foundation and technique to take down your opponent with ease. Remember, success in leg wrestling is not solely determined by brute strength but rather by a combination of technique, strategy, and relentless practice. So, lace up your shoes, find a worthy opponent, and dive into the exhilarating world of leg wrestling.

Wrestling Positions
All wrestling moves stem from the opening positions of the wrestlers. This means that the wrestlers practice moves based on their positioning at the beginning of rounds. Depending on whether they are starting in the neutral position or the referee’s position, wrestlers have an idea of what moves they can make and how they can accumulate the most points from their starting position.

What Are the Positions in Wrestling?
The main positions in wrestling are:
Wrestling Positions
In wrestling, there are two main positions that coaches teach to their athletes: the neutral position and the referee’s position. These are the positions that every wrestling round will start in. The athletes may also take these positions if the referee stops the round for any reason in the middle of a round. The wrestlers will resume the round in the positions that reflect who had the advantage when the referee stopped play.
Neutral Position
The neutral position in wrestling is the position that begins a wrestling match. It is always the position that the wrestlers begin the first round of the match in. The neutral position is just as it sounds; it does not give either wrestler the advantage that the referee’s position gives. The wrestlers start standing up across the mat from each other and facing each other.
If there is an overtime period in the wrestling match, it begins with the wrestlers in the neutral position. It is generally harder for wrestlers to get points out of the neutral position as it is harder to get wrestlers down on the mat from the standing, neutral position.
Referee’s Position (Starting Position)
The second position in wrestling is called the referee's position or starting position. This is when one of the wrestlers begins or resumes the round with their hands and knees on the mat while the other wrestler starts on top, behind, and in control of their opponent.
Wrestlers each have one round to choose whether they would like to start in the referee’s position or the neutral position. Most wrestlers plan the moves they make out of the referee’s position, as they choose this position as a way to gain points early in rounds that are started like this.
The referee’s position is also used at the start of double overtime, with the participant that scored first deciding what position they want to start in. If there were no points scored throughout the match, then the referee flips a disk to determine who can choose their position. If nobody scores within that double overtime period, then the athlete that was on top of the starting position is declared the winner.
FAQ
What wrestling positions are used to begin rounds?
The neutral position and the referee’s position are the two positions used to start rounds in wrestling. The first round always begins in the neutral position. Then, each wrestler gets one round to choose whether to start in the neutral or referee’s position.

The first key point to getting good at ...","Keys To Escaping From Bottom
It is important to be able to escape from the bottom position, but it is a difficult position for many wrestlers, especially newer wrestlers who are trying to earn escapes. There is no one move that will get you an escape every time you are on the bottom, but there are some key things you can focus on to help you become more effective at earning escapes.
The first key point to getting good at escapes is to really focus on hand control when you are on bottom; it can’t be emphasized enough how important hand control is when you are on bottom. It is extremely difficult to work your way out to a better position if your opponent has the ability to grab, hook, or lock onto you. It doesn’t matter if you are flat on your belly, on your knees, or have made it up to your feet, you must have hand control if you want to be successful at escaping. Also, a lot of the time, just having one of your opponent’s hands isn’t good enough, really focus on controlling both of their hands. If your opponent has nothing to grab a hold of you with, they will not be able to keep you down.
Another way to get better at escaping to know how to counter common breakdowns. Now there are some pretty crazy moves out there, but for the most part, you know when the whistle blows that your opponent will most likely be hitting a spiral ride, an elbow chop, or a tight waist ankle. These are the three major breakdowns that pretty much all wrestlers do. If you can learn how to defend just these three breakdowns, you will see much more success when you are in the bottom position.
There are a lot of options to defend these breakdowns, if you know your opponent is going to elbow chop you, then make sure you clear the arm out of the way when the whistle blows or you could base out real hard to stop the elbow chop. If they try to go tight waist ankle on you, you can lean back into them and peel the hand off your ankle or you can hit a granby roll to defend it.
Another way you can get better at escaping is to constantly be moving. One of the worst things you can do on bottom is just sit there and let your opponent work pinning combinations on you. There is a great expression in wrestling that activity creates opportunity and that is definitely true when you are on bottom. The movements shouldn’t be wild and crazy but rather control and precise because the main objective is for your movement to create an opening for the escape. You can hit sit outs, stand ups, granby rolls, and knees slides in hopes to create an opening to get away. Just make sure you are staying in good positions and trying to establish hand control.
One thing that can help you from the bottom position is to know and understand the rules in terms of what it takes for the top guy to get hit with stalling. They guy on top has to come off to the side, they can’t ride parallel with your hips the whole time. Also, if you stand up, they have to be advancing, they cannot just hang on your waist or your leg. Use this to your advantage. Here is a great video of Max Askren going over the quadpod position and he talks about using the stalling calls to your advantage if your opponent drops down to your leg. Sometimes it pays to work smarter, not harder.

Another common thing that keeps wrestlers from escaping is when the guy on top throws legs in. This is something that you should be prepared for and know how to defend. The best defense to a leg rider is to not let them get the legs in in the first place. If they do, there are many different counters to them, but for the most part you want to create separation between your hips and your opponent’s. Check out his video of Chael Sonnen explaining some of his favorite ways to defend a leg rider.
Getting out from the bottom has a lot to do with attitude. A lot of wrestlers think that being on bottom means its break time, but it most definitely is not. In a wrestling match, you never want to be in the less dominant position and when you are on the bottom, that is exactly where you are. Your opponent has a huge advantage over you. If you struggle to get escapes, part of your problem might be between your ears, you have to have the same mentality of going hard to escape from the bottom as you do when you are trying to get a takedown or a pin.

Lastly, when you are in practice, take wrestling from top and bottom seriously. All to often, when guys are wrestling live in practice, they let each other go so they can wrestle from their feet. When this happens, it is a disservice to both wrestlers because one wrestler is getting robbed of the chance to get better at top and the other getting better at escapes. Then, when they go out on the mat for a real match, both wrestlers will not be properly prepared.
It is very important for wrestlers to focus on wrestling from the bottom. Being able to get an escape will often win you close matches, especially in college where a wrestler can earn riding time. Focus on the basics and be relentless on bottom until you get the escape or reversal.

There is probably no escape technique in wrestling that is more underrated than sit outs. Despite the effectiveness of the stand up, it often plays into the hands of leg riders, ankle grabbers, people with effective mat returns, and anyone who is willing to simply “cling”. Because it automatically separates hips, the most crucial aspect of escaping, executing sit outs quickly puts the bottom man close to an escape while placing the top man in an awkward position with few defenses.
See the 5 Step Sit Out Series Below
Step 1:  Basic sit out position
When initiating sit outs, sit back into your opponent, not away. Keep your position tight, abs flexed, being ready to react to chops, pulls, etc. One of the advantages of sit outs is that you can get to the sit out position from anywhere…your belly, side, etc.
Step 2: Seal off, hip heist away
Your first and most basic option when performing sit outs will be to hip heist away. Execute this by first sealing off both of your sides. Push back into opponent with your shoulders raising your hips off the mat, then hip heist away.
Step 3: Head gizoni
When your opponent hangs their head over your shoulder in the sit out position, this is a great time for a head gizoni. Scoot to opposite hip the opponents head is on and post your elbow on the mat as you grab their head. Next, high step away from the head and duck under your opponents arm. Wrap around their waist as you step up and take them to danger. It is very important for you to take a big step with that high leg so you do not get held to the mat. If your opponent sucks you back, hip heist towards their head to escape.
Step 4: Arm gizoni
If your opponent comes over your arm in the sit out position, grab their wrist with your crosswrist hand. Punch your arm up underneath the arm they have over, step up and hip heist under the arm. Again, it is very important to take a big step with your high step leg to make sure you do not get caught on the mat. Finish with the reversal behind your opponent.
Step 5: Knee under stand up
From the sit out position, establish hand control on one side and post your hand on the other. On the post side, raise up and slide your knee where your rear is. Back pressure up to your feet and clear using any stand up finish.
Sit outs also afford options to score reversals and back points, making it one of the few techniques that is fundamentally safe and offensively dangerous. Stay ahead of the curve with this old fashioned powerhouse!

Bring your front leg back up and go back to your wrestling stance. Drill these movements repeatedly multiple times a week, and you'll be shooting like a high-level wrestler in no time. 2) The Single-Leg Takedown.","10 Wrestling Moves And Techniques You Should Master
Wrestling is one of the most popular martial arts worldwide, and it’s been around as far back as 3000 BC. It’s a grappling-based martial art that focuses on putting your opponent on the ground, controlling their body, and pinning them.
Wrestling is also an effective martial art for self-defense, and many view it as one of the best bases for mixed martial arts – the most permissive combat sport in the world that allows many of the techniques you might have to deal with in self-defense situations.
There are countless techniques used in wrestling, with some being more effective than others. This article will examine some of the most effective wrestling moves and techniques you should master. Many of these techniques carry over to other grappling-based martial arts like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and Judo.
Ten Wrestling Moves You Should Master
Ready to improve your wrestling skills? Let’s dive right into our list of techniques you should master:
1) The Penetration Step
The penetration step is the foundation for many takedowns used in wrestling like the single and double leg takedown. The technique is performed to put you in a position to grab onto your opponent and take them to the canvas.
Any competent wrestling school gets their students to drill this technique regularly unless the rules of the specific wrestling style forbid takedowns that target the leg, as is the case with Greco-Roman wrestling.
Practice the penetration step often until it becomes part of your muscle memory so you can execute the technique smoothly and quickly. The technique starts in your stance with your lead leg slightly in front of your rear foot and your torso a little bit bent at your hips.
Here’s how to perform the penetration step:
2) The Single-Leg Takedown
The single-leg takedown is one of the most commonly used techniques in wrestling, and that’s because it’s highly effective. There are several variations of the single-leg takedown, but they all involve targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and dragging them to the ground. There’s also the high crotch – commonly known as the hi-C single-leg technique that involves targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and using the hold to pick them off the ground and throw them to the floor.
The high single-leg takedown is the easiest type of single-leg attack to learn since you don’t need to perform a penetration step before shooting in on your opponent’s leg
Here’s how to perform a conventional high single-leg takedown:
Here’s how to complete a conventional single-leg takedown
Figure out which single-leg attacks work best for you and incorporate them into your wrestling game. These techniques are highly effective in wrestling settings and other grappling arts like BJJ.
3) Double-Leg Takedown
Double-leg takedowns are another popular technique used in wrestling. It’s a more interesting technique than the single leg, as it involves rapidly changing levels and exploding forward into your opponent. There are many ways to set up double-leg takedowns, like head snaps, hand ties, and misdirection.
These techniques are more effective when you catch your opponent with both legs close to each other, allowing you to wrap and lock your arms around them.
Shooting in is the building block for many wrestling takedowns, including double-leg techniques. Drill it frequently when you train to make your takedowns more effective. The faster and smoother your penetration step is, the more likely you’ll be able to complete takedowns when you shoot for them.
Here’s how to perform a double-leg takedown:
4) Sprawl
Sprawling is one of the fundamental defensive techniques used in wrestling, and it’s effective at all levels. Takedowns like the single leg and double leg involve wrapping your legs around your opponent’s legs to complete, but sprawling moves your legs out of your opponent’s legs and forces them to carry your weight. Your hand, head, and hips are your first line of defense against takedowns and holds, but you can always sprawl when all that fails.
Here’s how to perform a proper sprawl:
5) Snap-Down
The snap-down is a simple technique that puts you in the top turtle position. The best time to go for it is when your opponent is hunched over as they try to defend against incoming attacks. At that point, there’s nothing to stop their forward posture from crashing.
It’s a popular technique with freestyle wrestlers. Grapplers from other grappling styles, like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, are equally fond of it.
Here are the mechanics of the snap-down:
Besides being a simple way to end up in the top turtle position, snap-downs also open up your takedowns since both techniques require your opponent to do opposing things to defend against them. Your opponent needs to move their legs away from you to defend against takedowns which opens them up to the snap-down. Conversely, your opponent must pull their torso backward to defend against the snap down, leaving them vulnerable to takedown attempts.
6) Whizzer
The whizzer is another effective defensive move that all wrestlers should master. When you’re not in a position to sprawl out of a takedown attempt, the whizzer is your next line of defense. The technique involves securing a deep overhook on your opponent’s nearest hand as they try to complete a takedown.
Securing a whizzer puts lots of pressure on your opponent’s shoulder, and that’s often enough to discourage them from completing takedowns. You can also use the whizzer to drive your opponent to the ground in a half-nelson by wrapping your free hand around their neck, or you can execute a hip toss.
7) Switch
The switch is one of the fundamental techniques used to reverse disadvantageous positions in wrestling. A completed switch puts you in a dominant position or gets you back to your feet. Unlike escapes which only earn you a point in a wrestling match, reversals like the switch get you two points.
Here’s how to perform the technique:
8) Sit-Out
The sit-out is another fundamental defensive technique you can use to escape from bottom positions. At times, you can also use the technique to drag your opponent to the bottom.
Here’s what the mechanics look like:
9) Front-Quarter Nelson
The front-quarter nelson is a handy wrestling technique that carries over into other grappling arts. It’s an effective way to transition to a dominant position after stuffing an opponent’s takedown attempt with a sprawl.
To perform a front-quarter nelson:
10)  Chicken Wing (Armbar)
The chicken wing is one of the most uncomfortable things you can do to your opponent from top position. It’s also one of the most reliable holds for wearing down opponents and pinning them. Also known as the armbar in wrestling, the chicken wing gives your multiple options once you’ve secured the hold.
Here’s what the technique looks like:

Your defensive wrestling position is extremely important and can affect the outcome of a match.","Defensive Wrestling Techniques
You’ve probably heard the phrase that states the best defense is a good offense. That phrase rings true in the sport of wrestling, in which counters and defensive maneuvers can help win a match. If your defense is good enough, you’ll force your opponent into desperate situations and errors, turning their haste and ineffectiveness into instant offense for you. There are several defensive wrestling moves every wrestler should know in order to be better prepared for a match. Check out CoachUp’s handy tips on defensive wrestling moves and techniques, and take your newly found knowledge to the mat!
STANCE
Your defensive wrestling position is extremely important and can affect the outcome of a match. Use your hands, arms, head, and waist to defend your position. Try to effectively use your hands to fight off any attack, pushing back any body part that comes your way by controlling one or both of the opponent’s hands via the wrists. Use your head to block an opponent trying to tie up with you. Keep your hips back when in your stance, this will allow you a better range of motion and a suitable solution when a rapid reaction is needed. Work on strengthening your core muscles so that you will have a more stable wrestling stance.
SPRAWLING
Sprawling is an effective defense against opponents trying to go for a leg take-down. The first thing you should do when an opponent shoots at you is to drive your legs back as far as possible. You should land on the upper back of your opponent and drive your hips down. If your opponent grabs one or both of your legs before you can get away, keep driving your hips down, this cannot be said enough. Your opponent will begin to flatten out and loosen his grip. If that is the case, you can turn your defensive position into an offensive one by getting behind your opponent. Sprawling is an athletic move and one of the best defensive wrestling maneuvers you can learn to defend from leg attacks.
SIDE ROLL When your opponent has a hold of you from above, a good way to escape or counter is the side roll. Grab your opponent’s wrist and pull it across your waist. Use your other arm to reach out and secure your opponent’s arm above the elbow. Pull your opponent’s arm and turn your body so that your he or she loses balance and lands next to you. This move is best when it’s a surprise, so use it with caution. Your opponent might be expecting it if you try it right at the referee’s whistle, a good wrestler will make sure they’re not predictable.

Huddle Up
Try asking your wrestling coach for more advanced defensive wrestling techniques and counter moves. If you can outsmart your opponents on defense, you’ll have an awesome advantage and be able to win more matches. However, if you’re still struggling with these moves or can’t find enough one-on-one time with your school coach, consider booking one of CoachUp’s private trainers to help you out.

The most common wrestling escapes from the bottom position are Granby Roll, sucker drag, clear arm sucker drag, mule kick, beaking cradle, sitout hip heist, and Turtle roll. All these techniques help the wrestler to stand up or move away from an inferior position and gain control of the fight.
Bottom positions are the most dangerous positions in wrestling and thus escaping from them successfully is very important. These techniques help wrestlers to protect themselves against being pinned or put into submission holds. Wrestlers should always practice these techniques to improve their bottom game and increase their chances of winning matches.
Escaping from the bottom position is essential for a wrestler to be successful. Wrestlers should practice these moves regularly and understand the importance of being able to escape from inferior positions. With practice and dedication, these techniques can easily become second nature to the wrestler and make a big difference in their matches.
How Much is an Escape Worth in Wrestling?
In wrestling, an escape is worth one point. This means that if a wrestler escapes from the bottom position and stands up, they will be awarded one point. However, the wrestler must remain standing up in order to be successful and score the point. If they go back down or get put on a submission hold, the point will not be awarded.
Escape can be a crucial factor in deciding matches and can make the difference between winning and losing. It is important for a wrestler to have good technique when attempting to escape from the bottom position and be able to time it correctly in order to score the point.
What Wrestling Styles Benefit From Escaping?
All wrestling styles benefit from being able to escape from the bottom position. Greco-Roman and Freestyle wrestlers must be able to escape from inferior positions in order to score points and win matches.
In Folkstyle wrestling, escaping can help wrestlers avoid being put into submission holds or pinned and grant them time to get back in control of the match. Also, escaping can help wrestlers score points in Folkstyle matches, since they will be awarded one point if they escape from the bottom position and remain standing up.
How to Escape a Cradle in Wrestling?
To escape a cradle in wrestling, the wrestler must first turn their body away from the opponent. This will create space between them and make it easier to escape. The wrestler can then use their legs and arms to push off the opponent’s body, creating more space before standing up. This will help them escape the cradle and gain control of the match. The wrestler should also be aware of their opponent’s arms and make sure that they do not get caught in a submission hold.
Can I Practice Escapes at Home?
Yes, you can practice escapes at home. This is important for developing the muscle memory and technique necessary to escape from bad positions in wrestling.
You can practice by having someone hold you in a bad position, such as the bottom position, and then practicing escaping from it. You can also use objects, such as pillows and mats, to simulate the situation. It’s important to practice wrestling workouts at home to further improve your technique and condition yourself for the sport.
Conclusion
Wrestling escapes are essential for a successful wrestler. There are many different techniques and moves that can be used to escape from a bad position and gain control of the match. Some of the most common escapes are Granby Roll, sucker drag, clear arm sucker drag, mule kick, beaking cradle, sitout hip heist, and Turtle roll.
Knowing when to use these techniques is important for a successful escape from the bottom position. Additionally, an escape is worth one point in wrestling and can be the deciding factor in a match.

Drill these movements repeatedly multiple times a week, and you'll be shooting like a high-level wrestler in no time. 2) The Single-Leg Takedown.","10 Wrestling Moves And Techniques You Should Master
Wrestling is one of the most popular martial arts worldwide, and it’s been around as far back as 3000 BC. It’s a grappling-based martial art that focuses on putting your opponent on the ground, controlling their body, and pinning them.
Wrestling is also an effective martial art for self-defense, and many view it as one of the best bases for mixed martial arts – the most permissive combat sport in the world that allows many of the techniques you might have to deal with in self-defense situations.
There are countless techniques used in wrestling, with some being more effective than others. This article will examine some of the most effective wrestling moves and techniques you should master. Many of these techniques carry over to other grappling-based martial arts like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and Judo.
Ten Wrestling Moves You Should Master
Ready to improve your wrestling skills? Let’s dive right into our list of techniques you should master:
1) The Penetration Step
The penetration step is the foundation for many takedowns used in wrestling like the single and double leg takedown. The technique is performed to put you in a position to grab onto your opponent and take them to the canvas.
Any competent wrestling school gets their students to drill this technique regularly unless the rules of the specific wrestling style forbid takedowns that target the leg, as is the case with Greco-Roman wrestling.
Practice the penetration step often until it becomes part of your muscle memory so you can execute the technique smoothly and quickly. The technique starts in your stance with your lead leg slightly in front of your rear foot and your torso a little bit bent at your hips.
Here’s how to perform the penetration step:
2) The Single-Leg Takedown
The single-leg takedown is one of the most commonly used techniques in wrestling, and that’s because it’s highly effective. There are several variations of the single-leg takedown, but they all involve targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and dragging them to the ground. There’s also the high crotch – commonly known as the hi-C single-leg technique that involves targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and using the hold to pick them off the ground and throw them to the floor.
The high single-leg takedown is the easiest type of single-leg attack to learn since you don’t need to perform a penetration step before shooting in on your opponent’s leg
Here’s how to perform a conventional high single-leg takedown:
Here’s how to complete a conventional single-leg takedown
Figure out which single-leg attacks work best for you and incorporate them into your wrestling game. These techniques are highly effective in wrestling settings and other grappling arts like BJJ.
3) Double-Leg Takedown
Double-leg takedowns are another popular technique used in wrestling. It’s a more interesting technique than the single leg, as it involves rapidly changing levels and exploding forward into your opponent. There are many ways to set up double-leg takedowns, like head snaps, hand ties, and misdirection.
These techniques are more effective when you catch your opponent with both legs close to each other, allowing you to wrap and lock your arms around them.
Shooting in is the building block for many wrestling takedowns, including double-leg techniques. Drill it frequently when you train to make your takedowns more effective. The faster and smoother your penetration step is, the more likely you’ll be able to complete takedowns when you shoot for them.
Here’s how to perform a double-leg takedown:
4) Sprawl
Sprawling is one of the fundamental defensive techniques used in wrestling, and it’s effective at all levels. Takedowns like the single leg and double leg involve wrapping your legs around your opponent’s legs to complete, but sprawling moves your legs out of your opponent’s legs and forces them to carry your weight. Your hand, head, and hips are your first line of defense against takedowns and holds, but you can always sprawl when all that fails.
Here’s how to perform a proper sprawl:
5) Snap-Down
The snap-down is a simple technique that puts you in the top turtle position. The best time to go for it is when your opponent is hunched over as they try to defend against incoming attacks. At that point, there’s nothing to stop their forward posture from crashing.
It’s a popular technique with freestyle wrestlers. Grapplers from other grappling styles, like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, are equally fond of it.
Here are the mechanics of the snap-down:
Besides being a simple way to end up in the top turtle position, snap-downs also open up your takedowns since both techniques require your opponent to do opposing things to defend against them. Your opponent needs to move their legs away from you to defend against takedowns which opens them up to the snap-down. Conversely, your opponent must pull their torso backward to defend against the snap down, leaving them vulnerable to takedown attempts.
6) Whizzer
The whizzer is another effective defensive move that all wrestlers should master. When you’re not in a position to sprawl out of a takedown attempt, the whizzer is your next line of defense. The technique involves securing a deep overhook on your opponent’s nearest hand as they try to complete a takedown.
Securing a whizzer puts lots of pressure on your opponent’s shoulder, and that’s often enough to discourage them from completing takedowns. You can also use the whizzer to drive your opponent to the ground in a half-nelson by wrapping your free hand around their neck, or you can execute a hip toss.
7) Switch
The switch is one of the fundamental techniques used to reverse disadvantageous positions in wrestling. A completed switch puts you in a dominant position or gets you back to your feet. Unlike escapes which only earn you a point in a wrestling match, reversals like the switch get you two points.
Here’s how to perform the technique:
8) Sit-Out
The sit-out is another fundamental defensive technique you can use to escape from bottom positions. At times, you can also use the technique to drag your opponent to the bottom.
Here’s what the mechanics look like:
9) Front-Quarter Nelson
The front-quarter nelson is a handy wrestling technique that carries over into other grappling arts. It’s an effective way to transition to a dominant position after stuffing an opponent’s takedown attempt with a sprawl.
To perform a front-quarter nelson:
10)  Chicken Wing (Armbar)
The chicken wing is one of the most uncomfortable things you can do to your opponent from top position. It’s also one of the most reliable holds for wearing down opponents and pinning them. Also known as the armbar in wrestling, the chicken wing gives your multiple options once you’ve secured the hold.

There is probably no escape technique in wrestling that is more underrated than sit outs. Despite the effectiveness of the stand up, it often plays into the hands of leg riders, ankle grabbers, people with effective mat returns, and anyone who is willing to simply “cling”. Because it automatically separates hips, the most crucial aspect of escaping, executing sit outs quickly puts the bottom man close to an escape while placing the top man in an awkward position with few defenses.
See the 5 Step Sit Out Series Below
Step 1:  Basic sit out position
When initiating sit outs, sit back into your opponent, not away. Keep your position tight, abs flexed, being ready to react to chops, pulls, etc. One of the advantages of sit outs is that you can get to the sit out position from anywhere…your belly, side, etc.
Step 2: Seal off, hip heist away
Your first and most basic option when performing sit outs will be to hip heist away. Execute this by first sealing off both of your sides. Push back into opponent with your shoulders raising your hips off the mat, then hip heist away.
Step 3: Head gizoni
When your opponent hangs their head over your shoulder in the sit out position, this is a great time for a head gizoni. Scoot to opposite hip the opponents head is on and post your elbow on the mat as you grab their head. Next, high step away from the head and duck under your opponents arm. Wrap around their waist as you step up and take them to danger. It is very important for you to take a big step with that high leg so you do not get held to the mat. If your opponent sucks you back, hip heist towards their head to escape.
Step 4: Arm gizoni
If your opponent comes over your arm in the sit out position, grab their wrist with your crosswrist hand. Punch your arm up underneath the arm they have over, step up and hip heist under the arm. Again, it is very important to take a big step with your high step leg to make sure you do not get caught on the mat. Finish with the reversal behind your opponent.
Step 5: Knee under stand up
From the sit out position, establish hand control on one side and post your hand on the other. On the post side, raise up and slide your knee where your rear is. Back pressure up to your feet and clear using any stand up finish.
Sit outs also afford options to score reversals and back points, making it one of the few techniques that is fundamentally safe and offensively dangerous. Stay ahead of the curve with this old fashioned powerhouse!

The wrestling stance is one of the fundamental aspects of the sport and is essential for executing various techniques and moves. It is important for wrestlers to adopt a low, balanced stance to maintain their position on the mat and move quickly in any direction. In this article, we'll explore the different aspects of the wrestling stance and the techniques and moves associated with it.
What this article covers:
Wrestling Positions:
There are three main wrestling positions that wrestlers can be in during a match: the neutral position, top position, and bottom position. In the neutral position, both wrestlers are standing and are attempting to take each other down. The top position is when one wrestler has control over the other and is attempting to pin them. The bottom position is when a wrestler is trying to escape or reverse their wrestling position from the bottom.

Wrestling Moves - Tilts:
One of the moves wrestlers use to score points is a tilt. A wrestling tilt is a technique where the wrestler turns their opponent onto their back while maintaining control of them. This move is typically executed from the top position and can earn the wrestler two or three points, depending on the rules of the match.
Wrestling Techniques:
Wrestlers use a variety of wrestling techniques to gain an advantage over their opponent. These include takedowns, throws, and holds. A takedown is when a wrestler takes their opponent to the mat from the standing position. Throws are similar to takedowns but involve lifting and throwing the opponent onto their back. Holds are techniques used to control an opponent's movements and limit their ability to escape or counter.
Wrestling Escapes:
Escapes are essential for wrestlers in the bottom position. A wrestling escape is when a wrestler frees themselves from their opponent's hold and reverses their position. The most common escape techniques include the stand-up, the switch, and the sit-out.
Wrestling Sweeps:
Wrestling sweeps are techniques used to off-balance an opponent and take them down to the mat. This move is typically executed from the neutral position and can be used to set up a takedown or throw. Common wrestling sweeps include the ankle pick, the single-leg sweep, and the double-leg sweep.

In conclusion, the wrestling stance is crucial for executing various moves and techniques in wrestling. Wrestlers must maintain a low, balanced position to move quickly and effectively on the mat. Understanding the different wrestling positions, moves, techniques, escapes, and sweeps can help wrestlers gain an advantage over their opponents and achieve success in their matches.

In the world of wrestling techniques, the mastery of takedowns and escapes is the ultimate path to dominance. These form the foundation of a wrestler’s success, allowing them to gain control over opponents, score crucial points, and ultimately emerge victorious.
The art of takedowns requires a combination of technique, timing, strength, and agility. From single-leg takedowns to fireman’s carries, wrestlers have a range of techniques to initiate action, gain control, and keep opponents on the defensive.
On the other hand, escapes demand quickness, flexibility, and tactical awareness. Techniques such as the sit-out, Granby roll, and switch are vital for regaining control and neutralizing an opponent’s attacks.
Join us as we uncover the power of wrestling techniques and learn how to dominate with takedowns and escapes.
Table of Contents
Wrestling Techniques
Wrestling techniques encompass various skills and maneuvers that wrestlers employ to gain control over their opponents, score points, and ultimately achieve victory. These techniques are essential elements of the sport and serve as the foundation for a wrestler’s success.
Wrestling techniques can be broadly categorized into two main categories: takedowns and escapes. Each category serves a distinct purpose and plays a crucial role in the overall strategy of a wrestler.
Takedowns
Takedowns involve offensive maneuvers to bring an opponent from a standing position to the mat. The primary objective of takedowns is to gain control over the opponent and earn points. Takedowns require a combination of technique, timing, strength, and agility.
Various takedown techniques exist, including single-leg takedowns, double-leg takedowns, high crotch takedowns, fireman’s carry, ankle pick, and head and arm throw. Mastering takedowns allow wrestlers to effectively initiate the action, take control of the match, and put their opponents on the defensive.
Escapes
Escapes are defensive techniques to break free from an opponent’s control and regain a neutral or advantageous position. When a wrestler finds themselves in a compromised position, such as being underneath an opponent or being controlled on the mat, escapes become crucial for regaining control and avoiding potential points scored by the opponent.
Escapes require quickness, flexibility, and tactical awareness. Common escape techniques include the sit-out, Granby roll, switch, Peterson roll, standing switch, and hip heist. Developing strong escape skills allows wrestlers to recover from disadvantageous positions, neutralize their opponents’ control, and potentially score their own points.
Both takedowns and escapes are vital components of a wrestler’s skill set. The ability to proficiently execute takedowns allows a wrestler to dictate the flow of the match, take their opponents off balance, and score valuable points.
Conversely, solid escape skills empower wrestlers to break free from an opponent’s control, reverse the momentum, and regain a position of advantage.
Takedowns Examined
When it comes to basic takedown techniques in wrestling, there are several fundamental moves that wrestlers should focus on mastering.
One such technique is the single-leg takedown, which involves attacking one of the opponent’s legs, securing it with both arms and driving through to complete the takedown. This move relies on proper positioning and explosive power to successfully execute.
Another essential takedown technique is the double-leg takedown. This move is known for its power and effectiveness. In a double-leg takedown, the wrestler reaches behind the opponent’s knees with both arms, driving forward to lift them off the ground and take them down to the mat. It requires good timing, coordination, and the ability to generate force with the lower body.
Moving on to advanced takedown techniques, one prominent move is the fireman’s carry. This dynamic technique requires the wrestler to hook an arm over the opponent’s shoulder, grab the opposite leg, and lift them onto their back for a takedown. It is an explosive move that requires coordination, strength, and precise execution.
Another advanced takedown technique is the ankle pick. This technique involves quickly grabbing the opponent’s ankle, lifting it while driving forward to off-balance them, and ultimately taking them down. It requires speed, agility, and the ability to anticipate and exploit openings in the opponent’s defense.
Escapes Examined
Regarding basic escape techniques in wrestling, there are a few fundamental moves that wrestlers should focus on mastering. One such technique is the sit-out. This escape involves quickly rotating on the mat to face the opponent and escape their control. Executing effectively requires hip movement, proper hand placement, and explosive power.
Another essential escape technique is the Granby roll. This rolling maneuver utilizes momentum and body rotation to escape from the bottom position. Wrestlers typically execute the Granby roll by rolling over the shoulder or the head, using their agility and timing to evade their opponent’s control and regain a more advantageous position.
The switch is another basic escape technique that wrestlers should learn. This technique involves changing directions while on the mat to escape an opponent’s control. It allows the wrestler to transition from a defensive position to a potentially advantageous position by utilizing quickness and strategic movement.
One notable move on to advanced escape techniques is the Peterson roll. This dynamic role requires the wrestler to counter an opponent’s pressure by utilizing leverage and momentum to execute a controlled roll and escape. It demands high technical skill and awareness of the opponent’s positioning.
Another advanced escape technique is the standing switch. This move allows the wrestler to escape from the bottom position while standing, using quickness, precise footwork, and timing. The wrestler aims to swiftly switch positions with the opponent, gaining an advantage.

Summary
Integrating takedowns and escapes is the key to a well-rounded game. Seamlessly transitioning between offensive and defensive maneuvers empowers wrestlers to adapt to any situation, exploit their opponent’s weaknesses, and capitalize on scoring opportunities.
A well-rounded wrestler can confidently engage in the ebb and flow of a match, confidently executing takedowns while remaining poised to escape when necessary.
Wrestlers must dedicate themselves to consistent training and development to achieve mastery in takedowns and escapes. Wrestlers can refine their technique, improve their timing, and enhance their overall performance on the mat through drills, partner work, and mental preparation.
By continuously seeking improvement and seeking guidance from experienced coaches and mentors, wrestlers can unlock their full potential and excel in the sport.

Wrestling Reversals
A reversal is a basic move in wrestling in which a wrestler turns a less-favorable position into a favorable one. There are numerous different types of reversals used in wrestling. Keep reading to learn all about reversals in wrestling.
Table of Contents
What Is a Reversal in Wrestling?
A reversal in wrestling is when the wrestlers are on the mat, and the wrestler on the bottom is able to reverse control and put their opponent on the bottom. This can be done either on the mat or in a rear-standing position. In high school and NCAA wrestling, a successful reversal move is worth two points. In professional wrestling leagues, a reversal move is often worth one point.
Types of Reversals
Types of reversals in wrestling include:
Switch
The switch is a reversal used when you are in the bottom position and the opponent has one of your arms. The tactic involved is to shift your body so that your held arm is holding you up, instead of your free arm, after which you use your free arm to reach backwards while turning your opposite hip, grab your opponent’s legs, and drive your body into theirs until you have switched positions.
Granby Roll
The Granby Roll is another form of reversal that is a more advanced switch. To start out, the wrestler must clear their arms, legs, and hips from the opponent’s grasp. Then, they execute a roll in a somersaulting motion to extricate themselves from the opponent’s grasp, followed by facing the opponent and attempting to control their wrist or establish themselves in the top position.
Peterson Roll
The Peterson Roll is a type of Granby Roll reputedly invented by wrestler Ben Peterson. It can be done from a standing position, and involves leaning the body forward while simultaneously hooking the opponent’s leg from behind to roll their body along with yours until you are on top.
FAQ
How many points is a reversal worth in wrestling?
In high school and college wrestling, reversals are worth two points. Reversals are distinguished from escape-takedowns, which turn the act of escaping into a takedown on an opponent. Wrestlers do not have to regain their feet to earn points for a reversal, so long as they take control from their opponent.
How do you do a reversal in wrestling?
To do a reversal in wrestling, you need to essentially regain control while on the bottom and reverse positions so that your opponent is on top. This can be executed from either a rear-standing position or on the mat, but it must involve the wrestler coming from underneath and forcing their opponent to be in a position touching the mat underneath.

Wrestling is a sport that requires both offensive and defensive techniques to succeed. When a wrestler finds themselves in the bottom position, they must focus on escaping or reversing their position to gain an advantage over their opponent. In this article, we'll explore the different wrestling moves from the bottom position and how they can help a wrestler succeed.
What this article covers:
Wrestling Pins:
One of the most common ways to win a wrestling match is through a pin. In the bottom position, wrestlers must focus on avoiding the pin while working to escape or reverse their position. This can be done through a variety of techniques, including the stand-up, switch, and granby roll. These moves require the wrestler to use their speed, strength, and technique to break free from their opponent's hold and avoid the wrestling pin.

Wrestling Tie Up:
A wrestling tie-up is a position in wrestling where both wrestlers are holding onto each other's arms or head. From the bottom position, wrestlers can use the tie-up to control their opponent's movements and set up an escape or reversal. Common tie-up moves include the arm drag, the duck under, and the snap down. These moves require the wrestler to use their technique and quick reflexes to gain control of their opponent.
Wrestling Sweeps:
Wrestling Sweeps are moves used in wrestling to take an opponent off balance and gain control of the match. From the bottom position, wrestlers can use sweeps to reverse their position and gain an advantage over their opponent. Common sweeps include the Peterson roll, the sit-out, and the granby roll. These moves require the wrestler to use their speed and technique to take their opponent off balance and gain control of the match.
Wrestling Stance:
In wrestling, a wrestler's stance is critical to their success. From the bottom position, wrestlers must maintain a strong base and keep their hips low to the mat to avoid being taken down. This can be done through the tripod stance, where the wrestler has one hand on the mat and their other two points of contact on their opponent, or the sit-out stance, where the wrestler has one leg bent and their other leg extended to the side.
Wrestling Moves - Tilts:
Wrestling Tilts are moves used in wrestling to turn an opponent onto their back and score points. From the bottom position, wrestlers can use tilts to gain control of the match and potentially score a pin. Common tilts include the cross-body ride and the far arm bar. These moves require the wrestler to use their strength and technique to turn their opponent onto their back while maintaining control of them.
Improve your wrestling today with Bo Nickal and FanaticWrestling.com's help!
In conclusion, wrestling moves from the bottom position are critical to a wrestler's success. Whether using pins, tie-ups, sweeps, or tilts, wrestlers must be proficient in offensive and defensive techniques to escape or reverse their position and gain an advantage over their opponent. A strong stance and quick reflexes are also critical to avoid being taken down and to set up successful moves.

Wrestling Moves from Bottom:
In the bottom position, wrestlers must focus on escapes and reversals to gain an advantage over their opponent.

Wrestling Moves - Tilts:
A wrestling tilt is a technique used by wrestlers to turn their opponent onto their back while maintaining control of them. This move is typically executed from the top position and can earn the wrestler two or three points, depending on the rules of the match. Common tilts include the cross-body ride and the far arm bar.
Wrestling Moves from Neutral:
In the wrestling neutral position, wrestlers must focus on takedowns and throws to gain control of the match. Common moves from the neutral position include the single-leg takedown, the double-leg takedown, and the high crotch. These moves require the wrestler to use their speed, strength, and technique to take their opponent down to the mat.

In the world of wrestling, defending against the leg ride is crucial for maintaining control, preventing scoring opportunities, and turning the tide in your favor. This article will delve into effective strategies for defending against the leg ride while exploring leg wrestling moves, wrestling leg rides, leg drops in wrestling, and the role of leg slaps in wrestling.
What this article covers:
1. Leg Wrestling Moves:
Leg wrestling moves encompass a variety of techniques that involve utilizing the legs to gain an advantage over your opponent. While defending against leg wrestling moves is important, understanding them can also inform your defensive strategies. Here are a couple of common leg wrestling moves:
a) Leg Lariat: The leg lariat is a powerful move where a wrestler jumps into the air, extending one leg to strike their opponent's upper body or head. When defending against this move, focus on evasive footwork, maintaining distance, and countering with quick counterattacks.b) Leg Whip: The leg whip involves forcefully swinging your opponent's leg in a lateral or circular motion. To defend against a leg whip, anticipate the movement, maintain a solid base, and utilize effective hand control to disrupt your opponent's grip and balance.

2. Wrestling Leg Rides:
Wrestling leg rides are techniques that aim to control and immobilize your opponent by utilizing their legs. Defending against leg rides requires a combination of skill, balance, and anticipation. Let's explore a couple of leg ride variations:a) Cross Body Ride: In the cross body ride, your opponent wraps their arm around your leg while maintaining a parallel position. To defend against this ride, focus on maintaining a strong base, utilizing hip and leg movement to disrupt your opponent's control, and countering with escapes or reversals.b) Spiral Ride: The spiral ride involves your opponent positioning themselves diagonally behind you, securing control of your leg and utilizing body positioning to maintain control. To defend against a spiral ride, focus on hand control, hip movement, and maintaining a solid base to prevent your opponent from establishing control and disrupting their balance.
3. Leg Drops in Wrestling:
Leg drops are impactful offensive moves that can catch you off guard and potentially lead to scoring points or even a pin. When defending against leg drops, consider the following strategies:a) Anticipate and React: Watch for cues and anticipate the leg drop, enabling you to react quickly and evade the strike. This can involve moving out of the way, utilizing evasive footwork, or countering with your own offensive techniques.b) Establish Solid Positioning: Maintain a strong base and solid balance to minimize the impact of a leg drop. By staying grounded and having a stable foundation, you can absorb the force of the leg drop more effectively.
4. Leg Slaps in Wrestling:
Leg slaps are techniques commonly used in professional wrestling, particularly in entertainment-based promotions, to enhance the impact of strikes or moves. While they don't directly relate to defending against leg rides, it's worth noting their purpose and effect. Leg slaps create a loud sound effect when a wrestler strikes their own thigh or leg, adding theatrics and engaging the audience.
Conclusion:
Defending against the leg ride in wrestling requires a combination of technique, anticipation, and solid positioning. By understanding leg wrestling moves, such as leg lariats and leg whips, you can better anticipate and counter your opponent's attacks. Meanwhile, familiarizing yourself with leg rides, such as the cross body ride and spiral ride, allows you to develop effective defensive strategies. Remember to maintain a strong base, utilize hand control, and employ quick reactions to counter leg drops effectively. While leg slaps are primarily associated with entertainment-based wrestling, they add an element of theatrics to the sport. By mastering defensive techniques andexpanding your arsenal, you can become a well-rounded wrestler capable of nullifying the leg ride and seizing control of the match.

Advanced Techniques
Throws and Takedowns
Throws and takedowns are crucial skills in freestyle wrestling that can help you gain an advantage over your opponent. These advanced techniques require precision, timing, and a combination of strength and technique. Here are some throws and takedowns commonly used in freestyle wrestling training:
Double Leg Takedown: The double leg takedown is a classic move where you shoot in on your opponent’s legs, driving them to the mat and gaining control. It involves grabbing both legs and using explosive power to take your opponent down.
Single Leg Takedown: The single leg takedown is another effective move that involves attacking one of your opponent’s legs. You can execute it by grabbing the leg, driving forward, and taking your opponent down to the mat.
Fireman’s Carry: The fireman’s carry is a dynamic move that involves lifting your opponent’s body and carrying them over your shoulder. It requires a combination of speed, agility, and strength to execute properly.
Suplex: The suplex is a high-risk, high-reward move that involves lifting your opponent off the ground and throwing them backwards. It requires excellent technique and control to avoid injury to both yourself and your opponent.
Pinning and Escapes
Once you have successfully taken your opponent down, the next step is to secure a pin or escape from your opponent’s control. Pinning your opponent involves immobilizing their shoulders to the mat for a certain amount of time, while escapes help you break free from your opponent’s control. Here are some advanced techniques for pinning and escapes:
Crucifix Pin: The crucifix pin is a highly effective technique where you trap your opponent’s arm and leg, rendering them unable to escape. It requires precise positioning and leverage to maintain control and secure the pin.
Granby Roll: The Granby roll is a popular escape technique used when your opponent has you in a compromising position on the mat. It involves rolling and using momentum to escape and regain control.
Peterson Roll: The Peterson roll is a dynamic move that allows you to go from being on the bottom to securing a pin on your opponent. It involves using your opponent’s momentum against them and executing a quick roll to gain control.
Transitions and Reversals
Transitions and reversals are essential skills in freestyle wrestling that allow you to quickly change positions and gain an advantage over your opponent. These advanced techniques require a combination of agility, timing, and technique. Here are some transitions and reversals commonly used in freestyle wrestling:
Switch: The switch is a technique used when your opponent has you in a controlling position on the mat. It involves quickly rotating your hips and changing directions to reverse the situation and gain control.
Granby Series: The Granby series is a sequence of techniques that involve using momentum and quick movements to transition from one position to another. It includes the Granby roll mentioned earlier, as well as other variations like the Granby tilt and Granby gut wrench.
Hip Heist: The hip heist is a fundamental movement used to create space and regain control when your opponent has you on the ground. It involves shifting your hips and explosively pushing off the mat to reverse the situation.
By mastering these advanced techniques in throws and takedowns, pinning and escapes, as well as transitions and reversals, you can elevate your freestyle wrestling skills to a whole new level. Practice these moves diligently, focus on proper technique, and constantly refine your execution to become a formidable competitor in the sport.
Strength and Conditioning
Cardiovascular Endurance
Cardiovascular endurance plays a crucial role in freestyle wrestling training. This aspect of conditioning refers to the ability of the heart, lungs, and blood vessels to deliver oxygen to the working muscles efficiently. In a sport like wrestling that requires bursts of intense activity, having a high level of cardiovascular endurance is essential.
To improve cardiovascular endurance, wrestlers can engage in various exercises such as running, swimming, cycling, or using the elliptical machine. These activities help increase heart rate, improve lung capacity, and enhance overall endurance. Incorporating high-intensity interval training (HIIT) into the workout routine can also be beneficial. This involves alternating between short bursts of intense exercise and periods of active recovery. HIIT helps simulate the energy demands experienced during a wrestling match and improves cardiovascular performance.
Strength Training
Strength training plays a vital role in freestyle wrestling as it enables wrestlers to overpower opponents and execute powerful moves. It involves exercises that target major muscle groups, including the legs, core, and upper body. Building strength not only enhances wrestling performance but also reduces the risk of injuries.
Common strength training exercises for wrestlers include squats, deadlifts, bench presses, pull-ups, and shoulder presses. These compound exercises work multiple muscle groups simultaneously, mimicking the demands of wrestling movements. Wrestlers can also incorporate plyometric exercises like box jumps, medicine ball throws, and explosive push-ups to develop explosive power.
It is important to note that strength training should be performed with proper technique and progressively increased weights to avoid injuries. Wrestlers can work with a qualified strength and conditioning coach to design a program tailored to their specific needs.
Flexibility and Mobility
Flexibility and mobility are crucial for freestyle wrestlers as they require a wide range of motion to execute various techniques effectively. Flexibility refers to the ability to stretch muscles and tendons, while mobility refers to the ability to move joints freely through their full range of motion.
To improve flexibility, wrestlers can incorporate static stretching exercises into their training routine. These stretches involve holding a specific position for a prolonged period, targeting specific muscle groups. Dynamic stretching, which involves moving through a range of motion, can also be beneficial for warming up before training or competing.
Mobility exercises focus on improving joint range of motion and can include exercises such as hip circles, shoulder rotations, and ankle mobility drills. Yoga and Pilates can also help improve both flexibility and mobility while promoting core strength and balance.
In conclusion, a comprehensive freestyle wrestling training program should include elements of cardiovascular endurance, strength training, and flexibility/mobility exercises. By focusing on these aspects of strength and conditioning, wrestlers can enhance their overall performance, reduce the risk of injuries, and gain a competitive edge in the sport.
Drills and Practice
Shadow Wrestling
Shadow wrestling is an essential component of freestyle wrestling training. This drill involves practicing moves and techniques without an actual opponent. It allows wrestlers to improve their footwork, balance, and overall technique. Shadow wrestling is a great way to perfect wrestling moves by focusing solely on the execution of each technique.
To perform shadow wrestling, find a clear space and visualize an opponent in front of you. Practice your takedowns, throws, and escapes as if you were in an actual match. Focus on maintaining proper form, speed, and fluidity of movements. It is important to incorporate different scenarios and angles to simulate real wrestling situations.
Live Wrestling
Live wrestling is the most realistic and challenging form of training in freestyle wrestling. This drill involves actual combat with a partner, allowing wrestlers to apply techniques and strategies in a dynamic and unpredictable environment. It helps improve timing, reaction speed, endurance, and mental toughness.
During live wrestling sessions, wrestlers engage in controlled sparring matches with a partner. The objective is to score points by executing takedowns, escapes, and pins. It is crucial to focus on maintaining proper technique and adapting to your opponent’s movements. Live wrestling provides an opportunity to practice offensive and defensive tactics, as well as develop a strong sense of anticipation and reaction.
Partner Drills
Partner drills are an effective way to enhance coordination, communication, and teamwork in freestyle wrestling. These drills involve working with a training partner to practice specific techniques and movements. Partner drills help wrestlers develop a deeper understanding of timing, distance, and leverage.
One common partner drill in freestyle wrestling is the takedown drill. In this drill, wrestlers take turns attempting takedowns on each other while their partner defends and counters. This exercise promotes agility, balance, and quick thinking. Another example is the clinch drill, which focuses on maintaining control and positioning in the upper body.
Partner drills should be performed with proper supervision and safety precautions. It is important to communicate and establish a level of intensity that both partners are comfortable with. These drills provide valuable opportunities for wrestlers to refine their skills, build trust with their training partners, and simulate real match scenarios.
By incorporating shadow wrestling, live wrestling, and partner drills into their training, freestyle wrestlers can improve their technique, physical conditioning, and overall performance on the mat. These drills offer a well-rounded approach to mastering the art of freestyle wrestling.
Preparation and Recovery
Warm-up and Stretching
Before engaging in any freestyle wrestling training, it is crucial to properly warm up your body and perform stretching exercises. A good warm-up routine increases blood flow to the muscles, raises your body temperature, and prepares your joints for the intense physical activity ahead. This helps reduce the risk of injuries and enhances your overall performance.
To warm up effectively, start with a light cardiovascular exercise such as jogging or jumping rope for about 5-10 minutes. This gets your heart rate up and primes your body for action. Following the cardio warm-up, transition into dynamic stretching exercises. Dynamic stretches involve moving parts of your body through a full range of motion while gradually increasing the intensity. Examples of dynamic stretches for freestyle wrestling could include arm circles, leg swings, and trunk rotations. These exercises help to improve flexibility, increase muscle activation, and enhance coordination.
Nutrition and Hydration
Proper nutrition and hydration play a vital role in maximizing your performance during freestyle wrestling training. It is essential to fuel your body with the right nutrients to optimize energy levels, enhance muscle recovery, and support overall health.
Aim for a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods such as lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Proteins are particularly important for wrestlers as they aid in muscle repair and growth. Include sources like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, and plant-based proteins in your meals. Carbohydrates provide the necessary energy for your workouts, so opt for complex carbohydrates like whole grain bread, brown rice, and quinoa.
In addition to proper nutrition, staying hydrated is crucial for optimal performance. Water is essential for regulating body temperature, lubricating joints, and transporting nutrients to muscles. Aim to drink water throughout the day and increase your intake during training sessions. Avoid sugary drinks or excessive caffeine as they can lead to dehydration.
Rest and Injury Prevention
Rest and recovery are often overlooked aspects of freestyle wrestling training, but they are just as important as the actual workouts. Giving your body time to recover allows for muscle repair and growth, reducing the risk of overuse injuries and fatigue.
Ensure you have dedicated rest days in your training schedule. These rest days give your body a chance to recuperate and rebuild. Additionally, prioritize getting enough quality sleep each night, as it is during sleep that your body undergoes essential repairs and recovery processes.
To prevent injuries, it is crucial to listen to your body and avoid overtraining. Pushing yourself too hard without proper rest can lead to burnout and increase the likelihood of injuries. Incorporate recovery techniques such as foam rolling, stretching, and light exercises on rest days to promote blood circulation and muscle relaxation.
Remember, preparation and recovery are key elements in freestyle wrestling training. By warming up properly, fueling your body with the right nutrients, staying hydrated, and allowing ample rest, you can optimize your performance, prevent injuries, and achieve your wrestling goals.
In conclusion, freestyle wrestling training is a comprehensive and dynamic approach to developing the skills and techniques necessary for success in the sport. By incorporating a variety of exercises that focus on strength, agility, and technique, wrestlers can enhance their performance in the ring. From mastering takedowns and escapes to improving endurance and flexibility, the training methods discussed in this article provide a solid foundation for wrestlers of all levels. With dedication, discipline, and regular practice, individuals can refine their skills and achieve their goals in the world of freestyle wrestling. So, lace up your boots, hit the mat, and embark on a journey of growth and excellence in freestyle wrestling.

You’ve probably heard the phrase that states the best defense is a good offense. That phrase rings true in the sport of wrestling, in which counters and defensive maneuvers can help win a match. If your defense is good enough, you’ll force your opponent into desperate situations and errors, turning their haste and ineffectiveness into instant offense for you. There are several defensive wrestling moves every wrestler should know in order to be better prepared for a match. Check out CoachUp’s handy tips on defensive wrestling moves and techniques, and take your newly found knowledge to the mat!
STANCE
Your defensive wrestling position is extremely important and can affect the outcome of a match. Use your hands, arms, head, and waist to defend your position. Try to effectively use your hands to fight off any attack, pushing back any body part that comes your way by controlling one or both of the opponent’s hands via the wrists. Use your head to block an opponent trying to tie up with you. Keep your hips back when in your stance, this will allow you a better range of motion and a suitable solution when a rapid reaction is needed. Work on strengthening your core muscles so that you will have a more stable wrestling stance.
SPRAWLING
Sprawling is an effective defense against opponents trying to go for a leg take-down. The first thing you should do when an opponent shoots at you is to drive your legs back as far as possible. You should land on the upper back of your opponent and drive your hips down. If your opponent grabs one or both of your legs before you can get away, keep driving your hips down, this cannot be said enough. Your opponent will begin to flatten out and loosen his grip. If that is the case, you can turn your defensive position into an offensive one by getting behind your opponent. Sprawling is an athletic move and one of the best defensive wrestling maneuvers you can learn to defend from leg attacks.
SIDE ROLL When your opponent has a hold of you from above, a good way to escape or counter is the side roll. Grab your opponent’s wrist and pull it across your waist. Use your other arm to reach out and secure your opponent’s arm above the elbow. Pull your opponent’s arm and turn your body so that your he or she loses balance and lands next to you. This move is best when it’s a surprise, so use it with caution. Your opponent might be expecting it if you try it right at the referee’s whistle, a good wrestler will make sure they’re not predictable.

Huddle Up
Try asking your wrestling coach for more advanced defensive wrestling techniques and counter moves. If you can outsmart your opponents on defense, you’ll have an awesome advantage and be able to win more matches. However, if you’re still struggling with these moves or can’t find enough one-on-one time with your school coach, consider booking one of CoachUp’s private trainers to help you out.

A spirial ride and half nelson ride is also very effective in stopping the Grandy series. From the referees position, as you step your lead foot up, place your belly button hand inside your oponent’s thigh and your elbow hand extends their arm above the elbow.

Once you get the half nelson, the series starts.
Step 4 of Granby Roll: Ankle ride
Another great way to stop the Granby series is to switch sides and apply an ankle ride. Off the whistle, switch sides on your opponent and bump them forward. When their rear is off their ankles, hook their ankle with your inside leg. This will prevent your opponent from executing the Granby series.
Step 5 of Granby Roll: Don’t grab around the waist
A key tactic to always be aware of when wrestling a Granby wrestler is to stay away from reaching around their waist from the opposite side. Be extra aware when going behind your opponent on takedowns. Be sure to grab your opponent’s hip or ankle instead.

1. Snapdown Wrestling:
Snapdowns are dynamic moves employed in wrestling to gain control over an opponent by forcefully pulling down on their head or neck.

2. Abdominal Stretch Wrestling Move:
The abdominal stretch is a submission hold and wrestling maneuver where a wrestler applies pressure to their opponent's midsection and stretches their torso. It involves wrapping an arm around the opponent's neck and reaching across their body to secure their leg. To execute the abdominal stretch, wrestlers must maintain control, apply pressure, and leverage their own body weight to force their opponent into a compromising position.
3. Defending the Armbar in Wrestling:
When faced with an armbar, a wrestler must employ sound defensive techniques to prevent their opponent from hyperextending or submitting their arm. Here are a few strategies for defending against arm bars:a) Hand Fighting: Maintain control of your hands and wrists to prevent your opponent from securing a tight grip and isolating your arm for the armbar.b) Posture and Base: Maintain a strong posture and solid base, keeping your elbows tucked in and preventing your opponent from fully extending your arm.c) Rolling Out: If caught in an armbar, roll out of the submission attempt by using explosive movements and maintaining constant motion to escape the hold.
4. Escaping Your Back in Wrestling:
Finding yourself on your back in wrestling puts you in a vulnerable position, as it increases the risk of giving up points or being pinned. Here are some techniques to help you escape:a) Bridge and Roll: Initiate a bridge by elevating your hips off the mat, driving through your toes and shoulders. As you gain momentum, roll onto your side and continue the movement to escape your opponent's control.b) Granby Roll: Use agility and constant movement to roll away from your opponent, creating separation and regaining a better position.c) Switch: Change positions and reverse your opponent's grip by executing a quick switch. This technique enables you to escape their control and potentially initiate your own offense.
5. Understanding Falls in Wrestling and Technical Fall Wrestling:
In wrestling, a ""fall"" refers to a decisive victory achieved through techniques like pinning an opponent's shoulders to the mat for a specific duration or accumulating a substantial point lead. Falls represent the ultimate goal for wrestlers. A technical fall occurs when a wrestler establishes a significant point margin over their opponent, resulting in an automatic victory. Technical falls showcase a wrestler's dominance and skill, allowing them to secure a decisive win.
Conclusion:
Snapdown wrestling provides wrestlers with an effective means of gaining control and dictating the flow of a match. By incorporating defensive strategies against arm bars, mastering techniques to escape from your back, and understanding the significance of falls in wrestling, athletes can elevate their performance. Technical falls, in particular, serve as a testament to a wrestler's dominance and skill. By honing snapdown techniques and complementing them with a well-rounded skill set, wrestlers can strive for victories while exhibiting their expertise on the mat.

If your defense is good enough, you’ll force your opponent into desperate situations and errors, turning their haste and ineffectiveness into instant offense for you. There are several defensive wrestling moves every wrestler should know in order to be better prepared for a match. Check out CoachUp’s handy tips on defensive wrestling moves and techniques, and take your newly found knowledge to the mat!
STANCE
Your defensive wrestling position is extremely important and can affect the outcome of a match. Use your hands, arms, head, and waist to defend your position. Try to effectively use your hands to fight off any attack, pushing back any body part that comes your way by controlling one or both of the opponent’s hands via the wrists. Use your head to block an opponent trying to tie up with you. Keep your hips back when in your stance, this will allow you a better range of motion and a suitable solution when a rapid reaction is needed. Work on strengthening your core muscles so that you will have a more stable wrestling stance.
SPRAWLING
Sprawling is an effective defense against opponents trying to go for a leg take-down. The first thing you should do when an opponent shoots at you is to drive your legs back as far as possible. You should land on the upper back of your opponent and drive your hips down. If your opponent grabs one or both of your legs before you can get away, keep driving your hips down, this cannot be said enough. Your opponent will begin to flatten out and loosen his grip. If that is the case, you can turn your defensive position into an offensive one by getting behind your opponent. Sprawling is an athletic move and one of the best defensive wrestling maneuvers you can learn to defend from leg attacks.
SIDE ROLL When your opponent has a hold of you from above, a good way to escape or counter is the side roll. Grab your opponent’s wrist and pull it across your waist. Use your other arm to reach out and secure your opponent’s arm above the elbow. Pull your opponent’s arm and turn your body so that your he or she loses balance and lands next to you. This move is best when it’s a surprise, so use it with caution. Your opponent might be expecting it if you try it right at the referee’s whistle, a good wrestler will make sure they’re not predictable.

Huddle Up
Try asking your wrestling coach for more advanced defensive wrestling techniques and counter moves. If you can outsmart your opponents on defense, you’ll have an awesome advantage and be able to win more matches. However, if you’re still struggling with these moves or can’t find enough one-on-one time with your school coach, consider booking one of CoachUp’s private trainers to help you out. Our team has won many, many matches in the ring and they’d love nothing more than to pass some of that knowledge down to you as well. What are you waiting for?

The last step is to break the leg free. To do this, Cejudo locks over his opponent's arms with an ""S"" grip and kicks the leg down to the mat and pulls the arms up. High Crotch.","Step Up Your Shot Defense With These Techniques
Just like most other sports, defense is a very important part of wrestling. How your react when someone shoots in on you can determine if you get taken down or if you end up with two points after it is all said and done. There are three main types of shots in wrestling: single leg, double leg, and a high crotch and each one of these shots is defended differently.
Single Leg
To defend a head inside single leg, the first thing you want to do is get a whizzer, but as you will see in the video, Cejudo does not get the whizzer in deep. Instead, he does what he calls a “raptor whizzer” because he keeps his elbow tight to his side and makes hook with his hand and wrist. With his other hand, he is attacking the far wrist.

Another thing Cejudo does right away is moves his right leg from in between his opponent's leg to the outside so he can use it to pressure into his opponent and block. It is very important to move you leg to the outside to prevent your opponent from elevating the leg and putting you in an even worse position.
Once he has the raptor whizzer and has the leg blocking on the outside of the thigh, Cejudo is using his foot that is planted on the mat to drive into his opponent. It is very difficult to finish a single leg when you are moving backwards. Also, you will notice that Cejudo does not have inside head position, but if you can get your head to the inside, it makes it even more difficult for your opponent to finish the single leg.
Once you have defended the initial part of the single leg, the next thing to do is to get your leg back down to the mat. To do this, the hand that is down on the wrist is going to come under the chin and it will push up on the chin and you will turn and face your opponent.
The last step is to break the leg free. To do this, Cejudo locks over his opponent’s arms with an “S” grip and kicks the leg down to the mat and pulls the arms up.
High Crotch
In this video, two time NCAA champion and Olympian Ben Askren shows how to defend a high crotch by sitting the corner.
Sitting the corner really neutralizes an opponent after they shoot a high crotch in a couple of ways. First, it takes away the option of transitioning to a single leg or a double leg. It also takes takes a way the option for them to drive through you and lastly, it gives you an angle to attack them.
When you sit the corner, be sure to push your opponent to the outside. This takes away their ability to drive through you. Watch now Ben sits to the mat. He doesn’t just drop to his butt; he sits in a circular motion. Once you are down on the mat, you can lock in the crotch, around the waist, or pull them in tight to you. The big thing is to not give them space.
From here, Askren shows a couple different options. The easiest is to post up and get your hips on top so you end up on top in a leg ride position or you can roll them and end up on top and hit a near side cradle. He also shows two great cradle options from the sit the corner position.
Double Leg
In this last video, four time NCAA champion and world champion goes in depth how to defend a double leg.
Let’s break this video down a bit. First, whenever someone shoots a double on you, it is important that you meet them with your hips. Watch how Dake uses his hips to stop the momentum of his partner. This is very important, because if your opponent can blast you backwards with the double then turns the corner and drives across, it is very hard to defend. So you must stop it before it starts.

Another big thing that Dake goes over is moving your opponent’s head. There is a basic rule you can follow when defending shots, not just doubles. Put your opponent's head on the opposite position they want it to be. Basically, if they shoot a head inside single, put their head to the outside and then you sit the corner. If they shoot a double with their head on the outside stuff it to the inside. Where the head goes the hips follow, so if you can put the head in a bad position, the hips usually end up in a bad position.
After he stuffs the head to the inside, then sprawls to put his weight on his opponent. Watch how he circles to collapse his opponent down to take the power out of his opponent’s hips. Towards the end of the video, he even uses it to lock up a cradle.
These are all very effective shot defenses that are used in the highest levels of wrestling. Be sure to drill these defenses and try them when you are wrestling in practice. Really pay attention to the small details in the video because the small details often make a huge difference, especially with higher level competition.

In the world of wrestling, defending against the leg ride is crucial for maintaining control, preventing scoring opportunities, and turning the tide in your favor. This article will delve into effective strategies for defending against the leg ride while exploring leg wrestling moves, wrestling leg rides, leg drops in wrestling, and the role of leg slaps in wrestling.
What this article covers:
1. Leg Wrestling Moves:
Leg wrestling moves encompass a variety of techniques that involve utilizing the legs to gain an advantage over your opponent. While defending against leg wrestling moves is important, understanding them can also inform your defensive strategies. Here are a couple of common leg wrestling moves:
a) Leg Lariat: The leg lariat is a powerful move where a wrestler jumps into the air, extending one leg to strike their opponent's upper body or head. When defending against this move, focus on evasive footwork, maintaining distance, and countering with quick counterattacks.b) Leg Whip: The leg whip involves forcefully swinging your opponent's leg in a lateral or circular motion. To defend against a leg whip, anticipate the movement, maintain a solid base, and utilize effective hand control to disrupt your opponent's grip and balance.

2. Wrestling Leg Rides:
Wrestling leg rides are techniques that aim to control and immobilize your opponent by utilizing their legs. Defending against leg rides requires a combination of skill, balance, and anticipation. Let's explore a couple of leg ride variations:a) Cross Body Ride: In the cross body ride, your opponent wraps their arm around your leg while maintaining a parallel position. To defend against this ride, focus on maintaining a strong base, utilizing hip and leg movement to disrupt your opponent's control, and countering with escapes or reversals.b) Spiral Ride: The spiral ride involves your opponent positioning themselves diagonally behind you, securing control of your leg and utilizing body positioning to maintain control. To defend against a spiral ride, focus on hand control, hip movement, and maintaining a solid base to prevent your opponent from establishing control and disrupting their balance.
3. Leg Drops in Wrestling:
Leg drops are impactful offensive moves that can catch you off guard and potentially lead to scoring points or even a pin. When defending against leg drops, consider the following strategies:a) Anticipate and React: Watch for cues and anticipate the leg drop, enabling you to react quickly and evade the strike. This can involve moving out of the way, utilizing evasive footwork, or countering with your own offensive techniques.b) Establish Solid Positioning: Maintain a strong base and solid balance to minimize the impact of a leg drop. By staying grounded and having a stable foundation, you can absorb the force of the leg drop more effectively.
4. Leg Slaps in Wrestling:
Leg slaps are techniques commonly used in professional wrestling, particularly in entertainment-based promotions, to enhance the impact of strikes or moves. While they don't directly relate to defending against leg rides, it's worth noting their purpose and effect. Leg slaps create a loud sound effect when a wrestler strikes their own thigh or leg, adding theatrics and engaging the audience.
Conclusion:
Defending against the leg ride in wrestling requires a combination of technique, anticipation, and solid positioning. By understanding leg wrestling moves, such as leg lariats and leg whips, you can better anticipate and counter your opponent's attacks. Meanwhile, familiarizing yourself with leg rides, such as the cross body ride and spiral ride, allows you to develop effective defensive strategies. Remember to maintain a strong base, utilize hand control, and employ quick reactions to counter leg drops effectively. While leg slaps are primarily associated with entertainment-based wrestling, they add an element of theatrics to the sport. By mastering defensive techniques andexpanding your arsenal, you can become a well-rounded wrestler capable of nullifying the leg ride and seizing control of the match.

5 Essential Freestyle Wrestling Techniques for Beginners

Grip Techniques
Collar Tie

Double Wrist Control
Another essential grip technique for beginners in freestyle wrestling is the double wrist control. This grip involves grabbing both of your opponent’s wrists, allowing you to control their arms and limit their offensive options. By maintaining double wrist control, you can effectively neutralize your opponent’s attacks and set up your own offensive moves. It is crucial to maintain a strong grip on both wrists to prevent your opponent from breaking free.
Underhook
The underhook is a powerful grip technique that involves getting your arm underneath your opponent’s arm and around their back. This grip allows you to control your opponent’s upper body and set up various takedowns and throws. The underhook is particularly effective in close-quarters situations and can give you a significant advantage over your opponent. It is important to maintain a tight underhook grip and use it strategically to dictate the flow of the match.

Practice these grips diligently and focus on maintaining a strong grip to maximize your control over your opponent and execute effective offensive and defensive moves.

Practice these moves regularly, focusing on proper technique, timing, and maintaining control, and you’ll be well on your way to becoming a skilled wrestler.
Escapes and Reversals
In freestyle wrestling, having effective escape and reversal techniques is crucial for beginners who want to gain an advantage over their opponents. Escapes and reversals allow wrestlers to break free from a disadvantageous position and turn the tables in their favor. Here are three essential escapes and reversals that every beginner should learn:
Stand-Up Escape
The stand-up escape is one of the most basic and commonly used techniques in wrestling. It involves quickly getting back on your feet from the bottom position. To perform a stand-up escape, follow these steps:
Mastering the stand-up escape is essential for beginners as it allows you to quickly regain control and avoid giving your opponent any easy points.
Granby Roll
The Granby roll is a highly effective escape technique that can catch your opponent off guard. It involves rolling through and escaping from the bottom position. Here’s how you can execute a Granby roll:
Mastering the Granby roll will give you an advantage in escaping from potentially dangerous situations and can lead to scoring points or initiating your own attacks.
Peterson Roll
The Peterson roll is a technique that allows you to reverse your opponent and gain control from the bottom position. It requires a combination of speed, technique, and timing. Here’s how you can execute a Peterson roll:
The Peterson roll is an advanced escape and reversal technique that may take time to master. However, once you’ve perfected it, it can become a valuable weapon in your wrestling arsenal.
By mastering these essential escapes and reversals, beginners in freestyle wrestling can become more confident in their ability to escape from difficult positions and turn the tide in their favor. Practice these techniques diligently to improve your overall wrestling skills and increase your chances of success on the mat.
Pinning Techniques
Half Nelson
The half nelson is one of the most fundamental and effective pinning techniques in freestyle wrestling. It involves controlling your opponent’s upper body by using your arm and shoulder to apply pressure on their neck and shoulder. To execute the half nelson, follow these steps:
The half nelson is a versatile technique that can be used to set up other pinning moves or to control your opponent’s movements during a match. It requires proper technique and timing to execute effectively, so beginners should practice it extensively before using it in a competitive setting.
Cradle
The cradle is another effective pinning technique that involves immobilizing your opponent by securing both their arms and head. It is a great move to use when you have gained control of your opponent’s upper body. Follow these steps to execute the cradle:
The cradle is a highly effective move for securing a pin, as it restricts your opponent’s movement and makes it difficult for them to escape. It requires coordination and strength to execute properly, so beginners should focus on mastering the technique before using it in live matches.
Armbar
The armbar is a pinning technique that focuses on controlling and immobilizing your opponent’s arm. It can be used to set up a pin or to create opportunities for other offensive moves. Follow these steps to execute the armbar:
The armbar is a versatile move that can be used from various positions, such as when your opponent is on their back or when you are in a top position. It requires proper technique and control to execute effectively, so beginners should practice it under the guidance of a coach or experienced wrestler.
Defense Techniques
Sprawl
One of the most crucial defensive techniques in freestyle wrestling is the sprawl. The sprawl is a technique used to defend against an opponent’s takedown attempt. It involves dropping the hips and sprawling the legs backward when the opponent shoots in for a takedown.
By performing a sprawl, a wrestler can avoid getting taken down and maintain a dominant position on the mat. This defensive move requires good timing and quick reflexes to anticipate the opponent’s takedown attempt and react swiftly.
Front Headlock
Another effective defense technique in freestyle wrestling is the front headlock. This technique involves controlling the opponent’s head and neck from the front while standing or on the ground.
When an opponent initiates an attack, the wrestler can quickly secure a front headlock position by wrapping their arm around the opponent’s neck and grabbing their own wrist. From this position, the wrestler can exert control over the opponent’s movements and prevent them from executing their techniques effectively.
The front headlock can be used to counter an opponent’s takedown attempt or to set up various offensive moves such as throws or chokes. It requires good leverage and upper body strength to maintain control over the opponent while defending against their attacks.
Whizzer
The whizzer is another essential defensive technique that wrestlers utilize to counter an opponent’s takedown attempt. This move involves using a well-timed hip and arm movement to disrupt the opponent’s attack and regain control of the match.
When an opponent tries to execute a takedown, the wrestler can counter by sprawling one leg back while driving their hip into the opponent’s side. Simultaneously, they can wrap their arm around the opponent’s arm or waist, creating a whizzer position. This helps in neutralizing the opponent’s attack and turning the situation to their advantage.
The whizzer can be used to launch a counter-attack, escape from a precarious position, or gain control over the opponent’s movements. It requires a combination of agility, timing, and technique to execute effectively and prevent the opponent from scoring points.
Mastering these defense techniques – the sprawl, front headlock, and whizzer – is crucial for beginners in freestyle wrestling. By honing these skills, wrestlers can effectively defend against their opponents’ attacks, maintain control on the mat, and create opportunities for their own offensive moves.
In conclusion, mastering the essential freestyle wrestling techniques is crucial for beginners who want to excel in the sport. By understanding the fundamentals of stance, takedowns, escapes, reversals, and pinning combinations, wrestlers can build a strong foundation for their future success. These techniques not only enhance their skills but also improve their overall physical fitness, discipline, and mental toughness. With consistent practice and dedication, beginners can develop their wrestling abilities and progress to higher levels in the sport. So, grab your wrestling gear, find a coach, and start learning and implementing these essential techniques to become a formidable force on the mat. Happy wrestling!

Activities",0.96367,Keys To Escaping From Bottom - Fanatic Wrestling,https://fanaticwrestling.com/blogs/news/keys-to-escaping-from-bottom,"It is very important for wrestlers to focus on wrestling from the bottom. Being able to get an escape will often win you close matches, especially in college where a wrestler can earn riding time. Focus on the basics and be relentless on bottom until you get the escape or reversal. Magic Mat Work by Hudson Taylor is a wrestling GOLD MINE.","Keys To Escaping From Bottom
It is important to be able to escape from the bottom position, but it is a difficult position for many wrestlers, especially newer wrestlers who are trying to earn escapes. There is no one move that will get you an escape every time you are on the bottom, but there are some key things you can focus on to help you become more effective at earning escapes.
The first key point to getting good at escapes is to really focus on hand control when you are on bottom; it can’t be emphasized enough how important hand control is when you are on bottom. It is extremely difficult to work your way out to a better position if your opponent has the ability to grab, hook, or lock onto you. It doesn’t matter if you are flat on your belly, on your knees, or have made it up to your feet, you must have hand control if you want to be successful at escaping. Also, a lot of the time, just having one of your opponent’s hands isn’t good enough, really focus on controlling both of their hands. If your opponent has nothing to grab a hold of you with, they will not be able to keep you down.
Another way to get better at escaping to know how to counter common breakdowns. Now there are some pretty crazy moves out there, but for the most part, you know when the whistle blows that your opponent will most likely be hitting a spiral ride, an elbow chop, or a tight waist ankle. These are the three major breakdowns that pretty much all wrestlers do. If you can learn how to defend just these three breakdowns, you will see much more success when you are in the bottom position.
There are a lot of options to defend these breakdowns, if you know your opponent is going to elbow chop you, then make sure you clear the arm out of the way when the whistle blows or you could base out real hard to stop the elbow chop. If they try to go tight waist ankle on you, you can lean back into them and peel the hand off your ankle or you can hit a granby roll to defend it.
Another way you can get better at escaping is to constantly be moving. One of the worst things you can do on bottom is just sit there and let your opponent work pinning combinations on you. There is a great expression in wrestling that activity creates opportunity and that is definitely true when you are on bottom. The movements shouldn’t be wild and crazy but rather control and precise because the main objective is for your movement to create an opening for the escape. You can hit sit outs, stand ups, granby rolls, and knees slides in hopes to create an opening to get away. Just make sure you are staying in good positions and trying to establish hand control.
One thing that can help you from the bottom position is to know and understand the rules in terms of what it takes for the top guy to get hit with stalling. They guy on top has to come off to the side, they can’t ride parallel with your hips the whole time. Also, if you stand up, they have to be advancing, they cannot just hang on your waist or your leg. Use this to your advantage. Here is a great video of Max Askren going over the quadpod position and he talks about using the stalling calls to your advantage if your opponent drops down to your leg. Sometimes it pays to work smarter, not harder.

Another common thing that keeps wrestlers from escaping is when the guy on top throws legs in. This is something that you should be prepared for and know how to defend. The best defense to a leg rider is to not let them get the legs in in the first place. If they do, there are many different counters to them, but for the most part you want to create separation between your hips and your opponent’s. Check out his video of Chael Sonnen explaining some of his favorite ways to defend a leg rider.
Getting out from the bottom has a lot to do with attitude. A lot of wrestlers think that being on bottom means its break time, but it most definitely is not. In a wrestling match, you never want to be in the less dominant position and when you are on the bottom, that is exactly where you are. Your opponent has a huge advantage over you. If you struggle to get escapes, part of your problem might be between your ears, you have to have the same mentality of going hard to escape from the bottom as you do when you are trying to get a takedown or a pin.

Lastly, when you are in practice, take wrestling from top and bottom seriously. All to often, when guys are wrestling live in practice, they let each other go so they can wrestle from their feet. When this happens, it is a disservice to both wrestlers because one wrestler is getting robbed of the chance to get better at top and the other getting better at escapes. Then, when they go out on the mat for a real match, both wrestlers will not be properly prepared.
It is very important for wrestlers to focus on wrestling from the bottom. Being able to get an escape will often win you close matches, especially in college where a wrestler can earn riding time. Focus on the basics and be relentless on bottom until you get the escape or reversal.

The most common wrestling escapes from the bottom position are Granby Roll, sucker drag, clear arm sucker drag, mule kick, beaking cradle, sitout hip heist, and Turtle roll. All these techniques help the wrestler to stand up or move away from an inferior position and gain control of the fight.
Bottom positions are the most dangerous positions in wrestling and thus escaping from them successfully is very important. These techniques help wrestlers to protect themselves against being pinned or put into submission holds. Wrestlers should always practice these techniques to improve their bottom game and increase their chances of winning matches.
Escaping from the bottom position is essential for a wrestler to be successful. Wrestlers should practice these moves regularly and understand the importance of being able to escape from inferior positions. With practice and dedication, these techniques can easily become second nature to the wrestler and make a big difference in their matches.
How Much is an Escape Worth in Wrestling?
In wrestling, an escape is worth one point. This means that if a wrestler escapes from the bottom position and stands up, they will be awarded one point. However, the wrestler must remain standing up in order to be successful and score the point. If they go back down or get put on a submission hold, the point will not be awarded.
Escape can be a crucial factor in deciding matches and can make the difference between winning and losing. It is important for a wrestler to have good technique when attempting to escape from the bottom position and be able to time it correctly in order to score the point.
What Wrestling Styles Benefit From Escaping?
All wrestling styles benefit from being able to escape from the bottom position. Greco-Roman and Freestyle wrestlers must be able to escape from inferior positions in order to score points and win matches.
In Folkstyle wrestling, escaping can help wrestlers avoid being put into submission holds or pinned and grant them time to get back in control of the match. Also, escaping can help wrestlers score points in Folkstyle matches, since they will be awarded one point if they escape from the bottom position and remain standing up.
How to Escape a Cradle in Wrestling?
To escape a cradle in wrestling, the wrestler must first turn their body away from the opponent. This will create space between them and make it easier to escape. The wrestler can then use their legs and arms to push off the opponent’s body, creating more space before standing up. This will help them escape the cradle and gain control of the match. The wrestler should also be aware of their opponent’s arms and make sure that they do not get caught in a submission hold.
Can I Practice Escapes at Home?
Yes, you can practice escapes at home. This is important for developing the muscle memory and technique necessary to escape from bad positions in wrestling.
You can practice by having someone hold you in a bad position, such as the bottom position, and then practicing escaping from it. You can also use objects, such as pillows and mats, to simulate the situation. It’s important to practice wrestling workouts at home to further improve your technique and condition yourself for the sport.

Just as it is important to drill takedowns and pinning techniques, it is equally as important to drill the fundamental techniques such as controlling your opponents hips. Watching high level wrestling often looks flashy and that is the point that every wrestler wants to get to. What you need not forget is that these high level guys don’t only drill the flashy attacks.
Wrestling is very much a sport of strategy. One of the fundamental strategies of wrestling is trying to maintain control of your opponent, more so than he has on you. Similar to Jiu Jitsu and other grappling sports, much power and control comes from the hips.
Understanding this and being aware of this in a match can make all of the difference. Hip control is important for both attacking and defending. Maintain control of the hips when your opponent is both attacking and defending, and you already have an advantage.
In this video, Steven Keith demonstrates a drill from crab ride that focuses on keeping your opponent in the pocket, check it out below!
Steven begins by explaining the purpose of this technique is to keep your partner in your pocket. He states that the pocket is considered to be the space between your knees and your hips. The primary goal of this technique is to keep your partners hips in your pocket.
There are many variations of technique for this strategy, but Steven states for this one he is going to be laying on his back and will have his partner directly on top of him. Steven states a potential defense for your partner from here would be him pushing off his knees, getting your knees up, and getting to the outside of your pocket.

A good drill to prevent this is to put your partner in your pocket and pull him directly on top of you. The first thing this does is it makes it slightly more difficult for your partner to push off of your knees to create space and get out of the pocket. Crab walking from here assists in making it difficult for your partner because they have to constantly be moving to stay balanced.
The first step in the drill is to have your partner push on your thighs and try to get out while you crab walk and work on keeping him on top of you and in your pocket. Something to notice from here is when your partner goes to push on your thigh, you are to drop your hands down as well. His goal is to get his knees to his chest so when you drop your hands down it allows you to push back on his knees and prevent him from doing that.
There should be no way for him to escape if you are doing this correctly. Steven states that as you progress with this technique, there should never be a time where he even touches your knees because you will have underhooks and an elbow to elbow tie on both of his arms, pulling them back and making them completely useless for him.
This is a great drill to practice back and forth with a partner. In doing so you get the feel of what the objective is from each position, and it will help you improve your technique on both the offensive and defensive side.

The crab ride is a top riding situation in wrestling where you are sitting behind your opponent while he's in a sit-out. Your legs are stretched forward to get control of your opponents hips and legs. It's very important to use your feet to pull your opponents calves outwards while you use your knees to pinch his hips. Your hands should always remain on the inside of the arms fighting for different handles (Half Nelson, Claw, Two-On-One, etc).
This ride can be used to great effect when trying to throw legs in. Although the Crab Ride is one of the more favored positions of a leg-rider, it tends to be the most unstable. So, if you are defending against a leg rider and he happens to get legs in, it is best to force them to a crab ride so you can manage the situation better and escape easier.
Offense
Both you and your opponent will be in a sit-out position (sitting on your butt, legs stretched in front of you). You will hook your feet under his legs in front of his knees, gripping onto the sides of his shins, controlling the bottom portion of his legs. Your knees will pinch the hips in an effort to control his hips better. Try to keep your hands and arms underneath his arms at all times. Try to keep his hips sitting between your legs at all times.
Defense
Defensively you want to grab the soles of both feet as quickly as possible and pull his feet up to your hip. This will make it very uncomfortable for your opponent. Usually for someone to work with a crab ride their hands need to be under your arms, pulling your chest back away from your legs. If you’re holding onto their feet it connects the pulling of your shoulder to his feet. So when he pulls your shoulders it pulls his feet, making it very awkward for your opponent.

The Cradle, like the Parallel Leg Ride, is one of those situations that you never want to have to defend. It's one of the hardest things to get out of, which also makes it very nice when you get one offensively. You'll have your opponent's head hooked with one arm, a leg hooked with the other, and your hands locked in between. Try to go for a nice Butterfly Lock, as all of the others are subpar in comparison. Once you have a Cradle locked up you should be able to at least score some back points, if not ride the guy out until time expires or a stalemate happens. Try to keep your lock positioned towards the head so he can't kick through your grip easily.
Near Side Cradle
First we have the kids chop their opponent down to expose their ankle so we can lock that up with our right leg. That will control the guy a little bit so you can grab his head with your left hand and pull that down as you reach behind the leg with your right arm. Try to pull the head down to the point that you can get your hands locked up. The next goal would be to try to push the guy to his hip. You can put your head into his side (in Folkstyle) and drive with your legs to get him there. Once he's on his side, you can use one of the first two moves in this situation. Otherwise, you'd be looking at trying to use the third.
Cross-Face Cradle
Your left arm will go across his face (Cross-Face) and grab the far elbow. You'll then fold the arm towards you as you break him down a little bit and slide your left arm a little tighter around the neck. You can keep the near leg locked up like the Near-Side Cradle, as you reach behind the far leg and try to get your hands locked. Try to keep the elbow controlled the entire time. You can grab your wrist instead of locking your hands in an effort to keep the arm controlled. If you lose the arm and it slips out and across your back when you're on the other side you'll be in a very bad situation and might have to completely bail from the top position.",0.95694,Step Up Your Shot Defense With These Techniques - Fanatic Wrestling,https://fanaticwrestling.com/blogs/news/step-up-your-shot-defense-with-these-techniques,"To do this, the hand that is down on the wrist is going to come under the chin and it will push up on the chin and you will turn and face your opponent.

There are three main types of shots in wrestling: single leg, double leg, and a high crotch and each one of these shots is defended differently.
Single Leg
To defend a head inside single leg, the first thing you want to do is get a whizzer, but as you will see in the video, Cejudo does not get the whizzer in deep. Instead, he does what he calls a “raptor whizzer” because he keeps his elbow tight to his side and makes hook with his hand and wrist. With his other hand, he is attacking the far wrist.

Another thing Cejudo does right away is moves his right leg from in between his opponent's leg to the outside so he can use it to pressure into his opponent and block. It is very important to move you leg to the outside to prevent your opponent from elevating the leg and putting you in an even worse position.
Once he has the raptor whizzer and has the leg blocking on the outside of the thigh, Cejudo is using his foot that is planted on the mat to drive into his opponent. It is very difficult to finish a single leg when you are moving backwards. Also, you will notice that Cejudo does not have inside head position, but if you can get your head to the inside, it makes it even more difficult for your opponent to finish the single leg.
Once you have defended the initial part of the single leg, the next thing to do is to get your leg back down to the mat. To do this, the hand that is down on the wrist is going to come under the chin and it will push up on the chin and you will turn and face your opponent.
The last step is to break the leg free. To do this, Cejudo locks over his opponent’s arms with an “S” grip and kicks the leg down to the mat and pulls the arms up.
High Crotch
In this video, two time NCAA champion and Olympian Ben Askren shows how to defend a high crotch by sitting the corner.
Sitting the corner really neutralizes an opponent after they shoot a high crotch in a couple of ways. First, it takes away the option of transitioning to a single leg or a double leg. It also takes takes a way the option for them to drive through you and lastly, it gives you an angle to attack them.
When you sit the corner, be sure to push your opponent to the outside. This takes away their ability to drive through you. Watch now Ben sits to the mat. He doesn’t just drop to his butt; he sits in a circular motion. Once you are down on the mat, you can lock in the crotch, around the waist, or pull them in tight to you. The big thing is to not give them space.
From here, Askren shows a couple different options. The easiest is to post up and get your hips on top so you end up on top in a leg ride position or you can roll them and end up on top and hit a near side cradle. He also shows two great cradle options from the sit the corner position.
Double Leg
In this last video, four time NCAA champion and world champion goes in depth how to defend a double leg.
Let’s break this video down a bit. First, whenever someone shoots a double on you, it is important that you meet them with your hips. Watch how Dake uses his hips to stop the momentum of his partner. This is very important, because if your opponent can blast you backwards with the double then turns the corner and drives across, it is very hard to defend. So you must stop it before it starts.

Another big thing that Dake goes over is moving your opponent’s head. There is a basic rule you can follow when defending shots, not just doubles. Put your opponent's head on the opposite position they want it to be. Basically, if they shoot a head inside single, put their head to the outside and then you sit the corner. If they shoot a double with their head on the outside stuff it to the inside. Where the head goes the hips follow, so if you can put the head in a bad position, the hips usually end up in a bad position.
After he stuffs the head to the inside, then sprawls to put his weight on his opponent. Watch how he circles to collapse his opponent down to take the power out of his opponent’s hips. Towards the end of the video, he even uses it to lock up a cradle.
These are all very effective shot defenses that are used in the highest levels of wrestling. Be sure to drill these defenses and try them when you are wrestling in practice. Really pay attention to the small details in the video because the small details often make a huge difference, especially with higher level competition.

Arguably, one of the strongest techniques in wrestling is the cradle. It is one of the best techniques to control and pin an opponent.
For new grapplers out there, here is an intro guide for cradle wrestling. Check out the sections below to learn all of the basics and important tips for using the cradle.
Contents
What is the Cradle Wrestling Technique?
The cradle wrestling technique is a pinning combination used in wrestling to control and pin an opponent. You trap an opponent’s head and leg with your arms to control their body to secure a pin.
It’s an effective technique that has been around since the beginning of wrestling. Since the creation of cradle wrestling, different variations and setups have been developed.
Within Jiu-Jitsu and MMA, grapplers have adopted the cradle into their arsenals. The effectiveness and simplicity of the cradle wrestle technique proves it’s an effective move that you should consider learning.
Basic Wrestling Cradles
Cradle wrestling has numerous variations and setups, but you must know the two basic versions. Those are the inside and outside cradles.
The Inside Cradle
The first of the basic cradle wrestling techniques you need to know is the inside cradle. This cradle is when you hook the opponent’s head and inside leg.
You can get into an inside cradle setup from anything from a snap-down to a sprawl. To get into the inside cradle, hook the opponent’s head and inside leg.
When you’re hooking the leg, make your arm drive in to connect your hands and not your other arm. If you drive in your hand controlling the head, it turns you and makes it easy to be put on your back.
After connecting your hands, drive your head/chest into your opponent and put their side on the mat. From here, you can hop/walk to either side to finish your pin.
If you practice MMA or BJJ, you can use the inside cradle to transition to dominant positions or various chokes.
The Outside Cradle (Far-Side Cradle)
The outside/far-side cradle is held the opposite from the inside cradle. In this variation, you hook the outside leg of your opponent, along with their head.
Just like with the inside cradle, the far-side cradle can be setup from the same scenarios. When you’re in top position, control the head as your other arm shoots between your opponent’s leg.
The arm between their legs drives in and connects with your other arm at the opponent’s chest. There are different ways to get your opponent into a pinning position, but we’ll give you two common entries.
The safest way is to step around from behind your opponent, sit on your side, and pull them other. Your other choice is to forward roll to get them into a pinning position.
If you’re a BJJ or MMA practitioner, you can also use the far-side counter to enter dominant positions and submissions.
Cradle Wrestling Variations
There are a wide variety of cradle wrestling variations that you can learn. Here are three of the most effective variations you should consider learning.
Cross-face Cradle
The cross-face cradle wrestling is one of the most brutal cradle variations out there. This setup starts when you have your opponent flattened out on their stomach and set up a pin.
While on top, aggressively take a cross-face on your opponent and cup their far arm. This cross-face gives you complete control of your opponent’s head.
After grabbing your opponent’s arm, aggressively force their head to their knee. Once in position, lock in a near-side cradle and put your opponent on their back for the pin.
Roll-Through Cradle
When you grab a cradle, a common reaction by your opponent is to try and sit up. If they do this, it gives you a setup into a roll-through cradle.
The mistake many make when in this position is to try and force your opponent down, but they can’t do it. Instead, just put your head on the mat, roll to the side, and put your opponent on their back.
This roll puts you on top for a pin or in side control if you’re doing BJJ or MMA.
SuicideCradle
The last variation of cradle wrestling we’ll review is the suicide cradle. This cradle variation breaks the rule of never going to your back, but in certain scenarios, it works.
Your opening for this variation opens when your opponent isn’t opening up for you to grab a far-side cradle. To get your grips, you hop over your opponent’s back to get the grips, while simultaneously putting them on their back.
Once your grip is secured, continue rolling as your opponent rolls on top of you and onto their back. You come up with a cradle in a top pinning position.
Cradle Entries
What makes using different cradle wrestling combinations is that there are numerous entries. You can grab a cradle off of both offensive and defensive entries.
How to Defend Against Cradle Wrestling
Cradle wrestling techniques are tough to deal with, but there are tactics for defending against them. Here is how you can defend against cradle wrestling techniques.
Block/Break Grips
When your opponent attempts to put you in a cradle, you have to block or break the grips. You can’t let them connect their hands or you’re going to have a difficult time escaping.
Hands In
In order to keep out of the cradle, you need to keep your hands in to defend. With your hands in, you can block your opponent’s grips, hips, and escape.
Block Opponent’s Hips
If you get put in a cradle, the first defense you must do is block your opponent’s hips. You need to create space in order to take the pressure off and make room to escape
Kick Leg Out
When your opponent hooks your leg, you need to quickly kick out to avoid them gaining control.
Belly Down
To escape a cradle attempt, go belly down and elongate your body. Doing this will keep your opponent from crunching you inward while giving space to escape.
Important Tips to Remember When Doing Cradle Wrestling
Cradle wrestling is a great way to control your opponent, but you must remember the details. Here are some important tips to remember when using cradle wrestling.

The most common wrestling escapes from the bottom position are Granby Roll, sucker drag, clear arm sucker drag, mule kick, beaking cradle, sitout hip heist, and Turtle roll. All these techniques help the wrestler to stand up or move away from an inferior position and gain control of the fight.
Bottom positions are the most dangerous positions in wrestling and thus escaping from them successfully is very important. These techniques help wrestlers to protect themselves against being pinned or put into submission holds. Wrestlers should always practice these techniques to improve their bottom game and increase their chances of winning matches.
Escaping from the bottom position is essential for a wrestler to be successful. Wrestlers should practice these moves regularly and understand the importance of being able to escape from inferior positions. With practice and dedication, these techniques can easily become second nature to the wrestler and make a big difference in their matches.
How Much is an Escape Worth in Wrestling?
In wrestling, an escape is worth one point. This means that if a wrestler escapes from the bottom position and stands up, they will be awarded one point. However, the wrestler must remain standing up in order to be successful and score the point. If they go back down or get put on a submission hold, the point will not be awarded.
Escape can be a crucial factor in deciding matches and can make the difference between winning and losing. It is important for a wrestler to have good technique when attempting to escape from the bottom position and be able to time it correctly in order to score the point.
What Wrestling Styles Benefit From Escaping?
All wrestling styles benefit from being able to escape from the bottom position. Greco-Roman and Freestyle wrestlers must be able to escape from inferior positions in order to score points and win matches.
In Folkstyle wrestling, escaping can help wrestlers avoid being put into submission holds or pinned and grant them time to get back in control of the match. Also, escaping can help wrestlers score points in Folkstyle matches, since they will be awarded one point if they escape from the bottom position and remain standing up.
How to Escape a Cradle in Wrestling?
To escape a cradle in wrestling, the wrestler must first turn their body away from the opponent. This will create space between them and make it easier to escape. The wrestler can then use their legs and arms to push off the opponent’s body, creating more space before standing up. This will help them escape the cradle and gain control of the match. The wrestler should also be aware of their opponent’s arms and make sure that they do not get caught in a submission hold.
Can I Practice Escapes at Home?
Yes, you can practice escapes at home. This is important for developing the muscle memory and technique necessary to escape from bad positions in wrestling.
You can practice by having someone hold you in a bad position, such as the bottom position, and then practicing escaping from it. You can also use objects, such as pillows and mats, to simulate the situation. It’s important to practice wrestling workouts at home to further improve your technique and condition yourself for the sport.
Conclusion
Wrestling escapes are essential for a successful wrestler. There are many different techniques and moves that can be used to escape from a bad position and gain control of the match. Some of the most common escapes are Granby Roll, sucker drag, clear arm sucker drag, mule kick, beaking cradle, sitout hip heist, and Turtle roll.
Knowing when to use these techniques is important for a successful escape from the bottom position. Additionally, an escape is worth one point in wrestling and can be the deciding factor in a match. With practice and dedication, wrestlers can master these techniques and become successful wrestlers.",0.90859,,,,,

Gut wrench wrestling is a powerful technique utilized to control opponents on the ground and potentially score points or secure falls. In this article, we will delve into the art of gut wrench wrestling, while also exploring the intricacies of crucifix holds, technical fall victories, snapdowns, frog splashes, and techniques for escaping your back in wrestling.
What this article covers:
1. Gut Wrench Wrestling:
Gut wrench wrestling involves applying pressure to an opponent's midsection or ""gut"" to control their position and potentially expose their back for a pinfall. By leveraging strength, body positioning, and technique, a wrestler can manipulate their opponent's balance and create scoring opportunities. Gut wrench techniques require precision and control to disrupt an opponent's defenses and assert dominance on the mat.

2. Crucifix Holds:
Crucifix holds are a type of wrestling technique used to immobilize an opponent by trapping both of their arms. By securing one of your opponent's arms across their body while using your own arm to control their other arm, you restrict their movement and limit their defensive options. Crucifix holds can be utilized to set up pinning combinations or create scoring opportunities, enhancing a wrestler's chances of securing a fall.
3. Technical Fall Wrestling:
Technical falls occur when a wrestler establishes a significant point lead over their opponent, resulting in an automatic victory. The specific point margin required for a technical fall may vary depending on the wrestling style and competition rules. In freestyle wrestling, for example, a technical fall is often achieved when a wrestler establishes a lead of ten points or more. Technical falls highlight a wrestler's dominance and skill throughout the match.
4. Snapdown Wrestling:
Snapdowns are explosive moves used to bring an opponent to the mat by swiftly pulling down on their head or neck. Employing snapdowns in wrestling allows a wrestler to gain control and initiate scoring opportunities. By quickly reacting to an opponent's movements and capitalizing on openings, snapdowns can be utilized to gain an advantage and create opportunities for further offensive maneuvers.
5. Frog Splash Wrestling:
Frog splash wrestling is a high-impact move commonly seen in professional wrestling. It involves a wrestler leaping from an elevated position, such as the top rope, and landing on an opponent lying on the mat. Although primarily associated with entertainment-based wrestling, the visual appeal and potential for securing a pinfall make frog splashes notable within the realm of wrestling falls.
6. Escaping Your Back in Wrestling:
Finding yourself on your back in wrestling puts you in a vulnerable position, as it increases the risk of giving up points or being pinned. Here are some techniques to help you escape:a) Bridge and Roll: Initiate a bridge by elevating your hips off the mat, driving through your toes and shoulders. As you gain momentum, roll onto your side and continue the movement to escape your opponent's control.b) Granby Roll: Utilize constant movement and agility to roll away from your opponent, creating separation and regaining a better position.c) Switch: Execute a quick switch to reverse your opponent's grip and change positions. This technique enables you to escape their control and potentially initiate your own offense.
Conclusion:
Gut wrench wrestling, with its emphasis on controlling an opponent's midsection, showcases the skill and strength of a wrestler. By mastering techniques like the crucifix hold, understanding the significance of technical falls, incorporating explosive moves like snapdowns, and appreciating the visual spectacle of frog splashes, wrestlers can expand their repertoire and aim for victories. Furthermore, by developing effective strategies to escape from compromised positions on their back, wrestlers can minimize the risk of giving up pointsor falls. Through dedication, practice, and a comprehensive skill set, wrestlers can excel in gut wrench wrestling and establish themselves as formidable competitors on the mat.

The five step teaching process below is effective and efficient at teaching beginning FS & GR wrestlers Gut Wrench offense and defense. When they start scoring with the Gut and stopping it their confidence in competing in FS & GR will increase significantly.
Master the Wrestling Gut WrenchIn Just 5 Steps
Step 1:
The Set-up
A very effective set-up to the gut wrench is to begin by straddling one of your opponent’s legs. With the same side arm, reach under the opponent’s far armpit and lift their upperbody off the mat. As they are lifted, wrap your opposite arm under their waste and grab your own knee to ensure that you have your arm deep enough.
Step 2:
The Lock
After you have executed your gut wrench set-up, use your tight waist arm to grab your opposite elbow or as close to the elbow as possible. If you can get an elbow to elbow lock, that is generally best. If not, get as close to it as possible. Be sure to get your lock on the soft area of your opponent’s ribcage to ensure the tightest lock.
Step 3:
Pressure Position
Once you got your gut wrench lock where you want it, drop your shoulder to your opponent’s lower back. Think about having your shoulder below your lock. Step your inside foot up between your opponent’s legs and get your rear end in the air, staying square with your opponent’s body. This will drive all of your weight on to your lock. Keep the pressure in this position by driving down and forward.
Step 4:
The Drive
As you’re driving forward on your gut wrench, lift your opponent with your elbows to get their hips off the mat.
Step 5:
Turn and Finish
Once you get your opponent’s hips lifted on the gut wrench, drive your knee under them to put them in your lap. A good rule is, as you turn, your opponent turns with you. As you and your opponent are turning, pop your hips into a backarch and throw your lock to your head. This will take your opponent forward over their shoulders, eliminating any sort of defensive tactics they might have. Be sure to run your feet to get you back to the same straddle starting position. This will allow for a faster transition to another gut wrench. The solo gut drill is a great way for you to practice the gut wrench technique on your own.
When learning the gut wrench, cover all of the parts and make sure you have a basic understanding them. Be sure to focus on the lock, the shoulder position, the drive, turn and follow through. Once you master the gut wrench, you will take your freestyle and greco-roman wrestling to another level!

Most people see arm wrestling as a battle of strength, but champion arm wrestlers know that technique is critical. In fact, winning an arm-wrestling match has less to do with brute strength than with the way in which you place your body and torso in relation to your opponent. Rather than trying to push your opponent's arm down, use your arm and shoulder strength to pull down on your opponent's hand.

Remember, consistent practice, dedication, and learning from each match are key to becoming a formidable arm wrestler. ← Previous Post.","How to Get Better at Arm Wrestling: Mastering Key Techniques
Discover essential techniques to improve your arm wrestling skills with our comprehensive guide. Learn about Rising, Cupping, Wrist Cupping, Pronation, Belt Grip, and Strength Training to dominate your arm wrestling matches. Perfect for beginners and seasoned competitors alike
Here’s a list of key techniques how to get better at arm wrestling.
Rising
The Rising technique in arm wrestling is a strategic move that focuses on lifting your opponent’s hand upwards to gain leverage. This technique is not just about physical strength; it’s about understanding the mechanics of leverage and using it to your advantage.
Rising works by targeting the weakest point in your opponent’s grip – typically the fingers or the wrist. By lifting their hand upwards, you disrupt their stable position, making it harder for them to apply force effectively. This move shifts the battle from sheer force to a more strategic manipulation of leverage.
The key to rising is in the wrist and fingers. The action involves a combination of wrist flexion and finger extension. By flexing your wrist upwards while extending your fingers, you create an upward force on your opponent’s grip. This movement requires strength in the forearm and flexibility in the wrist.
To effectively implement rising in a match:
To train for rising, focus on exercises that strengthen your wrists and forearms. Wrist curls, reverse wrist curls, and finger extensions are great exercises. Additionally, practicing the rising movement with a partner or using an arm wrestling table can help develop the specific muscles and techniques needed.
Cupping: Securing a Strong Grip
Cupping is a fundamental technique in arm wrestling that involves curling your hand towards your wrist. This move is essential for establishing and maintaining a strong, controlling grip on your opponent’s hand. Mastering cupping can significantly enhance your arm wrestling prowess by allowing you to dictate the flow of the match.
Cupping centers around the concept of reducing your opponent’s leverage while maximizing your own. By curling your fingers and thumb towards your wrist, you effectively ‘cup’ your hand, creating a concave shape. This action tightens your grip and limits your opponent’s ability to maneuver or escape.
To successfully implement cupping:
To train for this technique, focus on exercises that strengthen your forearm flexors and enhance your grip strength. Activities such as wrist curls, finger curls, and grip strength trainers are beneficial. Additionally, practicing the cupping motion during sparring sessions can help in developing muscle memory and technique refinement.
Wrist Cupping: A Twist on Traditional Cupping
Wrist cupping is an advanced arm wrestling technique that builds upon the basic cupping move by adding a twist to the wrist. This nuanced approach not only enhances grip strength but also introduces an element of control that can be pivotal in a match. Understanding and mastering wrist cupping can give arm wrestlers an edge, especially in challenging bouts.
The technique starts with the basic cupping motion – curling your hand towards your wrist. Once this grip is established, you then add a twisting motion. This rotation typically involves turning your wrist inwards, towards your body. This movement not only strengthens your grip but also disrupts your opponent’s alignment and leverage.
To effectively use wrist cupping in a match:
Developing proficiency in wrist cupping requires specific training focused on wrist flexibility and strength. Exercises like wrist curls with a twist, pronation and supination movements with weights, and grip strengthening exercises are particularly effective. Practice the combined cupping and twisting motion regularly to build muscle memory.
Wrist cupping offers a strategic advantage by providing a more secure grip and disrupting the opponent’s strategy. It can be particularly effective against opponents who rely heavily on their wrist strength or those who use techniques like top-rolling. Mastering wrist cupping can be a game-changer, especially in high-stakes matches where every little advantage counts.
Pronation: The Art of Twisting
Pronation in arm wrestling is a critical technique where you rotate your arm to make your palm face downwards. This movement is particularly effective for countering your opponent’s grip and can play a pivotal role in gaining the upper hand in a match. Mastering pronation can greatly enhance your arm wrestling abilities, providing a strategic advantage over opponents.
Pronation involves rotating the forearm so that the palm turns to face down. This move is crucial in arm wrestling as it can weaken your opponent’s grip and reduce their leverage. By pronating your arm, you apply a twisting force that can disrupt your opponent’s position and strategy, making it difficult for them to maintain a strong hold.
To successfully use pronation in a match:
Pronation in arm wrestling is a critical technique where you rotate your arm to make your palm face downwards. This movement is particularly effective for countering your opponent’s grip and can play a pivotal role in gaining the upper hand in a match. Mastering pronation can greatly enhance your arm wrestling abilities, providing a strategic advantage over opponents.
Pronation offers a strategic edge in arm wrestling by allowing you to counter various grip techniques and styles. It’s especially useful against opponents who rely on techniques like the top roll or hook. Effective pronation can shift the dynamics of a match, giving you the leverage to overpower your opponent.
Belt Grip
The Belt Grip is a lesser-known but highly effective technique in arm wrestling that involves utilizing your belt or waistband to gain additional stability and leverage during a match. This technique is particularly useful in situations where maintaining endurance and a steady position is crucial. Understanding and correctly implementing the Belt Grip can provide a significant advantage in arm wrestling competitions.
The Belt Grip technique is based on the principle of using your own body and clothing as leverage points. By gripping your belt or waistband with your non-wrestling hand, you create a point of stability that helps you anchor your body more effectively. This technique allows for better control over your movements and can help resist the force exerted by your opponent.
In arm wrestling, balance and stability are as important as strength. The Belt Grip aids in maintaining a balanced posture by providing an additional anchor point. By holding onto your belt or waistband, you can prevent your body from being easily moved or twisted by your opponent’s actions, thereby maintaining a more advantageous position.
To effectively use the Belt Grip:
While the Belt Grip doesn’t require specific physical training, it does require practice to master. Incorporating this technique into your practice sessions will help you get accustomed to the feel and benefits it offers. Focus on maintaining the grip throughout various movements and techniques to understand how it affects your overall performance.
The main advantage of the Belt Grip is the added stability and leverage it provides. This can be especially beneficial in lengthy matches where endurance plays a crucial role. It also offers a psychological edge, as maintaining a steady and controlled posture can be intimidating to opponents.
Strength
In the world of arm wrestling, strength training is more than just a routine; it’s a crucial component for achieving success. While techniques and strategies are vital, the role of physical strength, particularly in the forearms, biceps, and shoulders, cannot be overstated. A well-rounded strength training program can significantly enhance your arm wrestling capabilities.
Arm wrestling demands a unique combination of strength, endurance, and power. It’s a sport that tests the limits of your arm’s muscular capabilities. Strengthening the muscles in your forearm, biceps, and shoulders not only improves your ability to exert force but also enhances your resistance against your opponent’s moves.
Recovery is as crucial as the workout itself. Ensure you have adequate rest days and consider incorporating recovery techniques like stretching, massage, or foam rolling. Proper nutrition and hydration are also vital for muscle repair and growth.
Conclusion
Improving at arm wrestling requires a mix of technique, strategy, and physical strength. By mastering techniques like Rising, Cupping, Wrist Cupping, Pronation, and the Belt Grip, and by enhancing your overall strength, you can significantly improve your performance in this challenging sport. Remember, consistent practice, dedication, and learning from each match are key to becoming a formidable arm wrestler.

What's a crotch lock?","#2: High Crotch Defense & Crack-Down
In wrestling, we always want to have options. We focus on winning and scoring out of every position. This hopefully happens when we are in on the shot, but sometimes we're not so quick and our opponent is in on our leg.
Even though we're in a defensive position, we should still look to score. This series goes over a bunch of different ways to capitalize on when our opponent makes that split second pause that so many do before finishing. Today, we're countering the so often used high crotch.
This lesson will also cover how to handle our opponent putting us in the same situation, offensively. We always try to teach both sides of the coin in this sport, offense and defense, because they are equally important to your knowledge base. You never know when you'll get thrown into a crackdown, it happens in scrambles all of the time.
High Crotch Defense
This would be when your opponent is in the high crotch position. You will want to react as quickly as possible. This is assuming you didn't stop him with your head and hands, you didn't sprawl well, so your opponent is in perfect position to finish the shot. You must attack this situation just like you would any other. You were put into a position, assess the situation as quickly as you can and react to the first move that comes to mind that seems easiest to get.
Crack Down Defense
When he has a high crotch, you can push his head and shoulders to the right. This will allow you to get past his shoulder and do what I call 'cut the corner'. Your right leg, the one he has control of, can slide between his leg as you grab a 'crotch lock'. What's a crotch lock? When you're on the left side of the crack down, your left arm will go through the legs, your right arm will go over his hips, and you'll lock your hands. While you're here, your right leg will be between his legs, you will be sitting on your right hip with a crotch lock. You should keep your left knee up, foot hugging your hips, in an attempt to prevent an easy double.
Double Defense
So in this position, he'll be running double and on his way to finishing the shot. You don't have many options in this case, and it very well might be too late depending on how well your opponent transitioned from the shot to the finish. If you act quickly enough and attack the following options, you can still salvage the position.
Crack Down Offense
When you get into a crack down (from the offensive side of the situation) you will want to get into what I call good position for the offensive guy. You should put your right hip down on the other side of his left leg (stage left). Drive your arm under the left leg to secure your shoulder into his hip which will prevent him from grabbing a crotch lock or attacking a leg to funk or something similar. If you stay in this position you will be pretty safe, allowing you to look for many different options.",0.95848,Crotch Wrestling: Exploring the High Crotch Technique - Fanatic Wrestling,https://fanaticwrestling.com/blogs/news/crotch-wrestling,"Crotch wrestling, a fundamental aspect of the sport, forms the backbone of various takedowns and control positions in wrestling.

Grappling
Shadow wrestling is more than a way to drill technique. It is also a wrestling conditioning modality and a highly effective one at that. If you want to level up your wrestling fundamentals and conditioning simultaneously, then start shadow wrestling now!
Shadow wrestling is a form of solo drilling where you are performing wrestling techniques without a training partner.
It’s as simple as that. So, let’s run through if shadow wrestling is effective for wrestlers (and even BJJ) and the main benefits of these solo wrestling drills.
Table of Contents
Is Shadow Wrestling Effective
I would class shadow wrestling as the most effective exercise you could do outside of normal wrestling training. And I’m not one to label something as best as it’s often dependent on the individual.
However, if I’m ranking conditioning modalities or use of time outside of wrestling class, this would be at number one. And you don’t even need extra wrestling equipment!
But if you’re wondering why, I’ve got 4 major benefits of shadow wrestling for you.
4 Major Benefits Of Shadow Wrestling
Retain & Perfect Techniques
Drill, drill, drill. While learning overarching concepts is important, you need to drill techniques over and over again so they become muscle memory and reactionary. As in, when you see an opening to shoot, you shoot. Not be standing there thinking about shooting before you do where it will be too late.
If you are a beginner, you can practice the basic techniques you’ve learned from class. If you learn some new stances or movements, you may not revisit them for a week so the techniques are easily lost. By shadow wrestling, you can practice them and keep new techniques fresh.
For more advanced wrestlers, shadow wrestling is going to hone your technique to perfection and improve the speed at which you can execute them. Not to mention, you are creating great habits.
Ingrain Good Habits
Wrestlers can develop poor habits especially when they aren’t practicing techniques or stances often enough. Sometimes it can come down to laziness or getting tired when training. For example, standing up tall and bouncing to “reset.” You’re basically signaling to your opponent you’re not ready to defend a shot.
5 Step Blueprint To Build A BJJ Strength Workout To Demolish Your Opposition
Learn how to plan your strength training to maximize transfer to the mats.
You can eliminate habits like this by shadow wresting. If you are aware this is you, you can make sure to consciously avoid doing this during your shadow drills and nail the wrestling fundamentals.
Specific Conditioning That Will Transfer To Grappling
There is a reason spending your training time cycling doesn’t help you run a marathon faster. And that is the lack of transfer. That is why you can run miles every week in your off-season, but when you get back on the mats, you feel like you haven’t trained at all.
Wrestling fitness is a beast of its own. Having to quickly change levels, push and pull opponents, and perform rapid changes of direction is vastly different than placing one foot in front of the other as you jog or sprint.
To paraphrase Russian sports scientist Yuri Verkhoshansky, the anaerobic threshold (the limit of the aerobic energy system before the anaerobic energy system starts to become the predominant supplier of energy) reflects the aerobic potential of the muscles involved in the work and it must stimulate the muscles in the same way as the competition exercise.
Meaning, while running or cycling trains the legs, it trains them in different muscular actions compared to wrestling. For example, running has little bending of the knees while cycling has no eccentric contractions.
That means the transfer to staying in a wrestling stance, having the stamina to be consistently moving side to side, and then making explosive shots or sprawls is minimal. Therefore, if you can perform your conditioning workouts with your wrestling techniques, you will find the greatest transfer to the mats.
Can Primarily Target Aerobic Or Anaerobic Energy Systems
While you can’t isolate energy systems as they all work together, you can manipulate intensity and work to rest ratios to emphasize certain energy systems and target certain adaptations.
For example, performing continuous shadow wrestling for 20-40 minutes while keeping your heart rate below 150 BPM will emphasize the aerobic energy system, increase the size of your heart chamber, develop blood vessels in the muscles being used, and increase the work capacity of your muscles.
These adaptations are vitally important as it improves the ability to deliver and use oxygen and enhances your ability to recover between high-intensity efforts like taking shots and scrambling. You can also perform high-intensity conditioning such as 2 x (6 x 60sec/90sec) of near-maximal shadow wrestling with 5-8 minutes of light movement between sets.
Here you are emphasizing the anaerobic lactic energy system and the ability to tolerate lactate and the associated by-products that build up as you dip into anaerobic energy production. Want to know what high-intensity shadow wrestling looks like? Check out Roman Bravo-Young below.

Visualization Of Opponents Offence
The final perk of solo wrestling drills is the ability to visualize what your opponent is doing and reacting to it in real-time. Running on the treadmill, while you can visualize yourself wrestling, doesn’t let you react and perform techniques based on what you imagine your opponent doing.
This visualization can cement the triggers that cause you to react with various techniques. For example, visualizing someone shooting after faking a snap down so you sprawl.
How To Shadow Wrestle Effectively
Effective shadow wrestling comes down to ruthlessly executing the fundamentals within your set work to rest ratios. Here are some videos with basic wrestling drills you can use for low and high-intensity solo wrestling drills.
Working on stances, footwork, and offensive and defensive techniques in a random or predetermined order is all you need. How fast you go will depend on the adaptations and energy systems you are targeting. Slower with less rest will emphasize aerobic energy production whereas faster with more rest will emphasize anaerobic energy production.

If you have a partner, you can level up your solo wrestling drills and perform partner drills that are even more specific as you are drilling the techniques. This video is a great example and you don’t even need mats. Just find some outdoor space with a friend.
When Should You Shadow Wrestle?
Shadow wrestling can be a great standalone training session. A solo wrestling drill workout can be used for the benefits mentioned above. However, shadow wrestling is the perfect warm-up to your wrestling class or even as a cool-down.

Shot Re-Shot Drill. The first drill on the list is a shot/re-shot drill. If you are not familiar with this, you can do it both offensively or defensively. To drill it offensively, grab a partner and have them block your first shot attempt.","8 Drills To Take Your Wrestling To The Next Level
To get better at wrestling, you need to be doing drills. There are so many different wrestling drills a person can and often times people fall into a pattern of doing the same drills over and over, but this may not be the best use of you time in practice. Plus, if you are only doing the same drills, you may hit a point where you feel like you aren’t really improving. Here are eight drills to help you take your wrestling to the next level.
Shot Re-Shot Drill
The first drill on the list is a shot/re-shot drill. If you are not familiar with this, you can do it both offensively or defensively. To drill it offensively, grab a partner and have them block your first shot attempt. Then, while your level is still low take another shot. You can change the type of shots you are looking for each time too. You may start with a double leg, then re-shoot with an outside sweep single. You can even have your partner change up how many shots they block so it may take you two or up to five shots before you get in on a leg.
To do this drill defensively, have your partner take a shot and this time you block them. Once you block their shot, as soon as the start to raise their level to come back up into a stance, you take a shot on them. Using the motion of your opponent’s shots as a setup is a great way to score takedowns. If you want to see this in action, check out some of Jordan Burroughs’ matches. He utilizes re-shots better than anyone in the world.
Cradle Drill
The next drill you can add is a cradle drill. You can start with your partner sitting with their knees bent, like they just hit a sitout from the bottom. Then practice going from one side to the other and each time locking up either a near side cradle or a farside cradle. When you feel that you have that down, you can have your partner move around on bottom and look to lock up cradles from the different positions they move to. This drill will help you to notice how many opportunities there are in a match to lock up cradles and there are a lot, but if you haven’t trained yourself to see them in the moment, when the opportunity presents itself, you will miss it.
Shot Transition Drill
Being able to smoothly transition from single legs to doubles and vice versa is an important skill in wrestling. To do this drill, get in on either a single leg or a double leg. Then, work on driving into your partner while they use their hips to pressure back into you. While you are driving them back, be sure to keep your head up and you hips under you; don’t try to finish the shot.
If you start with a single leg, your head should be on the inside. Your partner will push your head from the inside position to the outside. When they do, transition to a double leg. Begin moving and driving them around in a double leg until they push your head back to the inside, then transition back to single leg. You can keep going back and forth. This drill will help you to stay in good position when you are in on a shot.
Takedown To Pin
Every wrestler practices takedowns and pins, but a great drill to do is hit a takedown and immediately put your partner on their back and look for the pin. You could drill single legs to a half to a pin. Or you could hit a double leg straight into a turk. The combinations of takedowns to pins are endless. By doing this drill, it will train you to automatically look to turn your opponent when you hit a takedown in a match. Check out this video by Olympic gold medalist Henry Cejudo where he teaches a double leg directly into a turk finish.
Hand Control Drill
Another great drill to incorporate into your training is a hand control from the bottom drill. This is something that wrestlers at every level needs to work on. If you go to any wrestling meet, you will hear coaches yelling at their wrestler to get hand control when they are on the bottom. To do this drill, start out flat on your belly and have your partner get on top and get wrist control. From here, roll your wrists out and establish hand control on both sides. Then, work off your belly all the way to an escape on your feet. Be sure to keep hand control the whole time. As you feel more comfortable with this, have your partner give you some resistance and have them try to break your hand control while you work to escape. If you want to get good escaping from the bottom position, you have to learn to control your opponent’s hands.

Clearing Ties
One drill that can really help you out on your feet is clearing ties. To do this drill, get in a stance in front of a partner and have them reach up and try to lock up a collar tie. When you see the reaching, block with your hand and circle to the side they reached with. Then reset back to a neutral position. If they lock on to a collar tie before you can block their arm, then defend that with a shuck off or an over-tie or whatever other way you like to clear a collar tie. When you get comfortable, start clearing the tie then going immediately into a shot. This drill will help you use your opponent’s reach as a set up to your shot and train you to stay out of an ear to ear tie up. Check out this video of Bekzod Abdurakhminov where he teaches a double leg set up by posting up a collar tie.
Follow Drill
The next drill will help you get better at top and bottom. A follow drill is when you and your partner start out with one guy on bottom and one guy on top. The guy on bottom tries to move around without stopping by hitting sit outs, granby rolls, hip heists, and whatever else they want to try to escape the guy on top without doing a standup. This will help teach you to continuously move on bottom because in a match, if you just sit on bottom and aren’t trying to move, it makes it easy for your opponent to work pinning combinations on you. Good movement on bottom is key to earning escapes.
This drill also helps the top guy by forcing them to anticipate how the guy on bottom is going to move. Think of it as trying to ride a guy out for the win in double overtime.
Whizzer Single Leg Drill
One very common position that wrestlers at all levels find themselves in is holding onto a single leg while there opponent defends it with a whizzer. Since this is such a common position, it makes sense to practice what to do when you get in it. So you lock up a single leg and let your partner get in on a whizzer. From there, at a slow pace, practice different finishes and defenses to the whizzer. When you feel comfortable with them, increase the intensity until you are basically going at a live pace.

When it comes to combat sports, strength and conditioning training is most beneficial in wrestling. To succeed, you need the physical prowess to control and dominate an opponent of comparable stature and the mental toughness to not stop attacking until victory is achieved.
To give you an advantage in wrestling, I am providing you with the top workouts, exercises, and an analysis of the most critical physical metrics.
15 Best Strength & Conditioning Exercises For Wrestling
Shadow Wrestling
Mastering shadow wrestling requires diligent practice of the fundamentals during proper work-to-rest intervals. Many videos online demonstrate fundamental wrestling drills ideal for low- and high-intensity solo training.
Effective practice involves focusing on posture, movement, and offensive and defensive maneuvers in a planned or spontaneous sequence.
The intensity of your workout is determined by the physical adaptations and energy systems you want to target.
A slower pace with shorter rest times focuses predominantly on aerobic energy production, whereas a faster pace with longer rest periods increases anaerobic energy production.
If you can practice with a partner, you can improve your training by including partner drills, which allow for more direct application of techniques.
If you have a grappling dummy, use it to practice repeated takedown drills.
Rope Climbs
The rope climb is highly effective for wrestlers since it improves upper body strength, grip, and endurance.
This exercise develops the arms, shoulders, and back, providing a complete workout that is especially good for the physical demands of wrestling.
Squats
The squat is widely regarded as the best lower-body exercise working the glutes and quadriceps, albeit its efficiency depends on back strength. There are numerous varieties, including back, front, and Zercher squats.
Your previous injuries, training phase, and personal comfort with the exercise will determine your choice. Personally, I like the front squat, and here's how it's done.
Trap Bar Deadlifts
The deadlift is a crucial lower-body exercise in wrestling training targeting the glutes, hamstrings, quads, and back while improving grip strength.
While I'm wary about incorporating heavy deadlifts into routines since they can be difficult to recover from, affecting subsequent wrestling performance, it's unquestionably a favorite among some wrestlers and, when done correctly, can considerably complement a training program.
Many wrestlers, however, suffer from lower back ailments, which deadlifting can exacerbate. I advise using the trap bar instead of a standard barbell since it reduces lower back strain, and the higher grips limit the range of motion. Here is the technique:
Power Clean
I love combining Olympic weightlifting exercises with wrestling training, but you don't have to focus on thе classic snatch and clean and jerk exercises. Instead, you can go for easier-to-learn weightlifting variations that can efficiently increase strength and power without learning difficult techniques.
The goal is to rapidly lift big weights, bridging the gap between resistance training and wrestling practice. Here's how to do it effectively:
Snatch High Pull
The snatch high pull is my favorite exercise in weight training for building a strong upper back. It requires a concentrated effort from the ground up, utilizing the hips and upper back muscles to propel the barbell upwards toward your chest.
This exercise is a comprehensive full-body strength builder for wrestlers, including a mat return movement similar to the power clean. Here is the technique:
Fat Bar Bench Press
While powerlifters excel in bench pressing, not all approaches may be appropriate for wrestling-specific training. Adopting specific characteristics, such as their setup and leg drive, is advantageous, but changing the grip breadth is recommended for wrestling-specific strength. Here's a step-by-step instructions:
Push Press
The push press, derived from Olympic weightlifting, is essential to a wrestler's strength training regimen. It requires channeling strength from your legs to your hands and arms, similar to many wrestling takedowns. Here is how to do it:
Barbell Row
The barbell row is a powerful strength-building exercise that requires you to balance both your body weight and the weight of the barbell. Personally, I find this exercise difficult, but often, the most despised exercises produce the most significant benefits.
The dumbbell row is an excellent alternative to the barbell, especially when using big weights. Here's how to do a barbell row:
Towel Pull-Ups
Choosing towel pull-ups over the traditional type provides variety to your training. While not required, utilizing towels instead of a bar offers a unique challenge that focuses on hand, grip, and forearm strength, all of which are essential for wrestling in terms of good gripping and wrist control.
If you're new to towel pull-ups, start with a simple dead hang to develop your grip strength.
Jump Squats
Jumps are a great alternative to standard weightlifting routines. It's simple to begin, and you may ramp up the intensity by adjusting the weight. You can use a barbell on your back or hold a trap bar or dumbbells at your side.
Jumps can help you improve your ability to quickly generate force, an essential skill for wrestling. Here's a guide for doing them:
Romanian Deadlift
The Romanian Deadlift (RDL) is essential for anyone looking to strengthen their legs, particularly the hamstrings. It can be done with big loads, delivers a superb hamstring stretch, and efficiently strengthens the glutes and lower back. Unlike the regular deadlift, the RDL starts from the standing position.
To clarify, moving the weight off the floor does not constitute the first repetition of the RDL. Let's look at the proper technique for maximizing hamstring development.
KB Swing
The Kettlebell swing is a dynamic hip extension exercise that results in a swift and intense stretch in the hamstrings and glutes as the kettlebell swings back, followed by a quick hip thrust to activate these muscles.
Even a light 16 kg kettlebell can engage the glutes similarly to hip thrusts with a load equivalent to a 10-repetition maximum.
This is the proper technique:
Sandbag Carry
The bearhug carry, similar to sandbag loading, is a strenuous Strongman exercise that tests your whole body, from your hips to your hands. Regular practice of this workout can considerably improve your endurance. Here is the technique:
Farmers Walk
The farmer's walk is a crucial part of any wrestling training regimen, known for its emphasis on grip strength and upper back conditioning. While farmer's handles are commonly used, kettlebells are also feasible. Here is the method:
Importance Of Strength & Conditioning For Wrestlers
The easiest method to demonstrate the significance of strength and conditioning for wrestlers is to compare elite and sub-elite wrestling competitors.
126 male wrestlers were divided into three categories: top elite, elite, and amateur, with the top elite winning medals at European and/or World Championships, elite wrestlers competing but not winning a medal, and amateurs not competing [1].
A comprehensive array of testing evaluated strength, power, and conditioning. Top elite wrestlers had a 12% higher aerobic capacity than amateurs, except lightweight wrestlers, who showed no significant difference.
During maximal cycling sprint tests, top wrestlers outperformed amateurs in terms of average and peak lower body power.
Elite wrestlers produced 12.5% and 7.5% more peak and average power production, respectively, but only in middleweight.
When comparing top elite and elite wrestlers, the distinctions were not obvious, implying that beyond a certain threshold of physical ability, top-tier wrestlers are distinguished by their technical and strategic talents.
It should be noted the amateurs in this study had less training experience than the elite wrestlers, which may account for their lesser physical talents.
However, these findings are based on a single study, and a wealth of additional information is available.
Wrestling Strength Elite vs. Non-Elite
A four-time World Senior Greco-Roman wrestling champion from Iran, participating in the 55 kg category, performed 30% more pull-ups and 8% more sit-ups than the national average, demonstrating his outstanding muscular endurance ability [2].
When adjusted for body weight, this wrestler displayed more strength in the back squat than national requirements, scoring 1.83 instead of 1.79. However, his bench press performance was marginally lower, at 1.39, compared to the national norm of 1.48 relative to body weight.
Elite Iranian junior wrestlers in the 55 kg weight class exhibited comparable strength, with averages of 1.9 and 1.4 for squat and bench press, respectively, when assessed against body weight [3].
Elite Iranian Junior wrestlers had better squat and bench press values than Division III American College wrestlers, indicating top-tier wrestlers may have more strength [4].
Furthermore, a study of elite Junior Turkish wrestlers examined strength differences between those who made the National Team for the World Championships and those who did not.
Instead of using standard dynamic movements such as squats and bench presses, this study assessed isometric grip, back, and leg strength [5]. Wrestlers chosen for the national squad had a 10% greater grip strength, 12% more back strength, and 7% better leg strength isometrically than non-selected wrestlers.
A 2015 study of senior wrestlers compared elite and sub-elite competitors [6].
Elite wrestlers had over eight years of experience and had competed in at least three international tournaments, whereas sub-elite wrestlers were national finalists who had never competed internationally.
Elite wrestlers performed more bench presses (1.1 vs. 0.9) and squats (1.4 vs. 1.1) proportional to their body weight than sub-elite wrestlers.
A 2011 study intended to uncover physical parameters predicting wrestling performance by comparing elite and amateur wrestlers across weight classes (lightweight, middleweight, heavyweight) [7].
Elite wrestlers had more lean mass and demonstrated 12-26% more squat and bench press strength than amateurs. Their maximum muscle power for these workouts was much higher, ranging from 14 to 30 percent more than amateurs.
Surprisingly, the primary difference in muscle strength and power was not age or training experience but lean body mass.
Top-level wrestlers displayed greater grip strength in the lightweight and middleweight categories, increasing by 6-19%, but this difference was not detected in the heavyweight class. Furthermore, elite wrestlers demonstrated a 7-20% increase in maximal back strength compared to amateurs.
It is obvious dynamic and isometric strength are critical for wrestling performance and should be prioritized in a wrestler's strength training plan.
Wrestling Conditioning Elite vs. Non-Elite
Aerobic and anaerobic performance were measured in elite Junior Iranian freestyle wrestlers, with lower body average power ranging from 330 to 620 Watts and aerobic capacity averaging 50 to 57 ml.kg-1min-1[3].
For context, top-level endurance athletes can have aerobic capacities of more than 70 ml.kg-1min-1 [8], while senior elite wrestlers frequently have average power outputs of around 836 Watts [9]. Exceptionally, certain athletes can produce power outputs of more than 1000 W!
Junior elite wrestlers frequently outperform elite taekwondo practitioners regarding average power relative to body weight, highlighting the importance of lower-body anaerobic strength in wrestling over striking-based combat sports [10].
Interestingly, these young elite wrestlers' lower body power outputs beat those of the German 4000m pursuit World Record holders from the 2000 Olympics [11].
Early research comparing elite and non-elite juvenile wrestlers in the United States found peak anaerobic power of the arms and legs, proportional to body weight, was a significant differentiator. In comparison, aerobic ability was not as important [13].
But how do top-tier senior wrestlers compare to their less experienced peers?
Elite Spanish wrestlers competing internationally showed 11% more peak power than their national-level peers [12]. However, elite wrestlers had only a slight edge in aerobic capacity over sub-elite rivals.
A comprehensive 2011 study of 92 wrestlers from five nations, grouped by experience level and body weight, stands out in this research field [14].
Elite wrestlers in this study had extensive experience and competed in major European and/or World Championships, while amateurs were national finalists.
Elite wrestlers in all weight classes performed better on the Wingate test in terms of absolute and relative upper-body average, as well as peak power.
The significant difference in anaerobic power could be ascribed to top wrestlers' 3-5% higher lean mass, which corresponds strongly with anaerobic peak and median power in such tests [15].
A more recent evaluation of 71 research publications, including 2,124 wrestlers, sought to uncover significant physiological features among wrestlers [16]. The key findings include:
According to the research, elite wrestling performance is defined by the ability to create high levels of anaerobic power and capacity. Improving this requires significant fat-free mass, muscular strength, and power. It should be addressed within a wrestling conditioning program.

Should You Do Strength & Conditioning In-Season?
For both parents and ""lazy"" college wrestlers, not doing S&C during the season is one of the worst decisions they can make.
Strength training should never be stopped during the season. Your risk of injury will rise as the season goes on because you will get weaker and less fit.
If you compete at least once a week, you might not even need to do any additional conditioning, but weightlifting should remain a priority.
It could be once or twice a week depending on how often you wrestle. The following is a sample two day per week sample schedule for a wrestling strength program during the season:
Day 1
A1) Front Squat 3 x 3 @80% 1RM
B1) Fat Close Grip Bench Press 4 x 2 @83% 1RM
B2) Weighted Towel Pull-Up 4 x 5-6 @8 RPE
C1) Sandbag Carry 2 x 20-40m
Day 2
A1) Medicine Ball Scoop Toss 3 x 3
B1) Power Clean + Push Press 2 x 2+2, 1 x 2+1, 1 x 1+1
C1) DB Jump Squat 2 x 5 @10% bodyweight
C2) Explosive Incline Push-Up 2 x 5
Summary
Wrestling strength and conditioning do not have to be complicated. It's all about consistency and doing just enough to foster growth while keeping you healthy enough to wrestle. It's a tricky balancing act involving trial and error.

To get better at wrestling, you have to drill movements over and over until they become second nature so when you are on the mat competing, you aren’t thinking what to do you are just reacting with good technique. Wrestling is unique in that you practice and compete on a mat which most people don’t have at home, but what do you do if you are at home and want to work on your wrestling skills and don’t have access to a wrestling mat or even a training partner? Well there are ways to train and get better even if you are home alone. Here are six wrestling drills you can do from home without a wrestling mat or a partner.
Standups
Standing up from the bottom is a very important skill that any wrestler needs to have. You do not need a mat and definitely do not need a partner to practice stand ups. You can do these in your living room, garage, or even your bedroom. To drill stand ups at home, you do not need to do them fast, in fact drilling moves slow with perfect technique is a better way to learn moves than doing them fast and with sloppy technique. Then, when you have the technique down, you will be able to speed the drill up and still maintain great form.
When drilling stand ups alone, you can practice both an inside leg stand up or an outside leg stand up. Really focus on bocking hands and getting ready to grab hand control. Make sure you hips are under you and you are pressuring back. You can mimic peeling hands off you and turning and facing your opponent ending in a good stance. You can hit it on the right side or the left, each time imagining different scenarios that may unfold on the mat. Another variation you can do is get in referee’s position next to a wall. Then, hit your stand up and use the wall to pressure back in to.
Stance and Motion
Practicing your wrestling stance and motion is an easy drill you can do at home. The more time you spend in your stance overall, the easier it will be to maintain a good stance when you are tired during a match.
All you have to do to practice stance and motion is find an open space. Be sure to switch up your lead legs, you can lower your level, imagine you are blocking a shot, or even face a wall and pretend your shadow is your opponent. Make sure you are staying light on your feet and circling. Since you won’t be on a wrestling mat, you probably don’t want slide your knees across the carpet, but you can practice taking high level singles or double leg shots or duck unders.  If you want to take it to the next level, get some rubber training bands and use those for resistance while you are motioning in your stance.
Drop Steps
Another easy move to practice is the footwork of a drop step or sometimes called a back step which is used in many different types of throws. Make sure you practice on both sides and really focus on sticking your butt way out when you finish. If you don’t know what a drop step is, check out this video where Henry Cejudo uses a drop step to hit a hip toss.
Back Arches and Neck Bridges
Back arches are important skills to develop in wrestling and you don’t need a partner or a wrestling mat to do them. To work on a back arch, simply lay on the floor and get in the back arch position and hold. This will help to develop flexibility in the spine and the hips which is very beneficial in wrestling. If you want to take it to the next level, do wall walk back arches. Stand a couple feet from a wall facing away. Then lean back and use your hands to walk yourself down the wall then back up.

Having a strong neck as a wrestler will help you defend half nelsons, help you maintain a good stance when a guy is trying to snap your head down, and even fight off your back. To do neck bridges, do a back arch, but instead of using your hands, arch up on the back of your head. Then you can flex and extend your neck to help build up the muscles in your neck. Once you feel you are comfortable with those, you can step over to a tripod position and then back to the neck bridge. If you need, fold a towel up and put it under your head for some extra padding.
Agility Drills
Being light on your feet and having good movement in wrestling is important. There are all kinds of drills you can do at home to increase footspeed, balance, and agility. A quick internet search of the words “agility drills” or “foot speed drills” will provide you with more than enough drills to keep you busy. You can purchase an agility ladder for very cheap and do drills with it in your garage or out in your yard.
Pull-ups
The last thing on the list is pull-ups. Now pull-ups aren’t necessarily a wrestling drill like the others on the list, but having a strong back and grips are so important in wrestling that developing these strengths is something you should focus on and doing pull-ups is an easy way to do it. All you need to do is install a simple pull-up bar in your house and you are all set. There are a lot of pull-up variations to keep you from getting bored with them. If you have a pull-up bar at your house, you can literally do them everyday.
Hopefully this list gives you some ideas on ways you can get better even if you don’t have access to a wrestling mat. Doing little drills like this may not seem like much, but if you stick with them they can make a huge difference in your skill level.

Takedown tactics: the science behind wrestling success
There’s something primal about wrestling – two grapplers locked in a tense struggle, where raw strength meets cunning strategy. It’s a dance of leverage, momentum, and the will to win. And the key to mastering that dance? The takedown.
A well-timed takedown in wrestling can turn the tables in an instant. It’s both a powerful offensive weapon and a key way to avoid dangerous positions. But beyond brute force, what makes a takedown truly effective? Let’s break it down.
The Anatomy of a Takedown
A successful takedown isn’t just one move. It’s a series of actions, each setting up the next:
Power vs. Precision: A Takedown Taxonomy
Many takedowns fall into two broad categories, but the best wrestlers master a mix of both:
The Role of Defense
Just as important as launching a takedown is knowing how to stop one. Sprawls, whizzers, and strategic movement are your arsenal for staying on your feet. Good defense means forcing your opponent to work even harder for the takedown.

From here, roll your wrists out and establish hand control on both sides. Then, work off your belly all the way to an escape on your feet. Be sure to keep hand control the whole time.","8 Drills To Take Your Wrestling To The Next Level
To get better at wrestling, you need to be doing drills. There are so many different wrestling drills a person can and often times people fall into a pattern of doing the same drills over and over, but this may not be the best use of you time in practice. Plus, if you are only doing the same drills, you may hit a point where you feel like you aren’t really improving. Here are eight drills to help you take your wrestling to the next level.
Shot Re-Shot Drill
The first drill on the list is a shot/re-shot drill. If you are not familiar with this, you can do it both offensively or defensively. To drill it offensively, grab a partner and have them block your first shot attempt. Then, while your level is still low take another shot. You can change the type of shots you are looking for each time too. You may start with a double leg, then re-shoot with an outside sweep single. You can even have your partner change up how many shots they block so it may take you two or up to five shots before you get in on a leg.
To do this drill defensively, have your partner take a shot and this time you block them. Once you block their shot, as soon as the start to raise their level to come back up into a stance, you take a shot on them. Using the motion of your opponent’s shots as a setup is a great way to score takedowns. If you want to see this in action, check out some of Jordan Burroughs’ matches. He utilizes re-shots better than anyone in the world.
Cradle Drill
The next drill you can add is a cradle drill. You can start with your partner sitting with their knees bent, like they just hit a sitout from the bottom. Then practice going from one side to the other and each time locking up either a near side cradle or a farside cradle. When you feel that you have that down, you can have your partner move around on bottom and look to lock up cradles from the different positions they move to. This drill will help you to notice how many opportunities there are in a match to lock up cradles and there are a lot, but if you haven’t trained yourself to see them in the moment, when the opportunity presents itself, you will miss it.
Shot Transition Drill
Being able to smoothly transition from single legs to doubles and vice versa is an important skill in wrestling. To do this drill, get in on either a single leg or a double leg. Then, work on driving into your partner while they use their hips to pressure back into you. While you are driving them back, be sure to keep your head up and you hips under you; don’t try to finish the shot.
If you start with a single leg, your head should be on the inside. Your partner will push your head from the inside position to the outside. When they do, transition to a double leg. Begin moving and driving them around in a double leg until they push your head back to the inside, then transition back to single leg. You can keep going back and forth. This drill will help you to stay in good position when you are in on a shot.
Takedown To Pin
Every wrestler practices takedowns and pins, but a great drill to do is hit a takedown and immediately put your partner on their back and look for the pin. You could drill single legs to a half to a pin. Or you could hit a double leg straight into a turk. The combinations of takedowns to pins are endless. By doing this drill, it will train you to automatically look to turn your opponent when you hit a takedown in a match. Check out this video by Olympic gold medalist Henry Cejudo where he teaches a double leg directly into a turk finish.
Hand Control Drill
Another great drill to incorporate into your training is a hand control from the bottom drill. This is something that wrestlers at every level needs to work on. If you go to any wrestling meet, you will hear coaches yelling at their wrestler to get hand control when they are on the bottom. To do this drill, start out flat on your belly and have your partner get on top and get wrist control. From here, roll your wrists out and establish hand control on both sides. Then, work off your belly all the way to an escape on your feet. Be sure to keep hand control the whole time. As you feel more comfortable with this, have your partner give you some resistance and have them try to break your hand control while you work to escape. If you want to get good escaping from the bottom position, you have to learn to control your opponent’s hands.

Clearing Ties
One drill that can really help you out on your feet is clearing ties. To do this drill, get in a stance in front of a partner and have them reach up and try to lock up a collar tie. When you see the reaching, block with your hand and circle to the side they reached with. Then reset back to a neutral position. If they lock on to a collar tie before you can block their arm, then defend that with a shuck off or an over-tie or whatever other way you like to clear a collar tie. When you get comfortable, start clearing the tie then going immediately into a shot. This drill will help you use your opponent’s reach as a set up to your shot and train you to stay out of an ear to ear tie up. Check out this video of Bekzod Abdurakhminov where he teaches a double leg set up by posting up a collar tie.
Follow Drill
The next drill will help you get better at top and bottom. A follow drill is when you and your partner start out with one guy on bottom and one guy on top. The guy on bottom tries to move around without stopping by hitting sit outs, granby rolls, hip heists, and whatever else they want to try to escape the guy on top without doing a standup. This will help teach you to continuously move on bottom because in a match, if you just sit on bottom and aren’t trying to move, it makes it easy for your opponent to work pinning combinations on you. Good movement on bottom is key to earning escapes.
This drill also helps the top guy by forcing them to anticipate how the guy on bottom is going to move. Think of it as trying to ride a guy out for the win in double overtime.
Whizzer Single Leg Drill
One very common position that wrestlers at all levels find themselves in is holding onto a single leg while there opponent defends it with a whizzer. Since this is such a common position, it makes sense to practice what to do when you get in it. So you lock up a single leg and let your partner get in on a whizzer. From there, at a slow pace, practice different finishes and defenses to the whizzer. When you feel comfortable with them, increase the intensity until you are basically going at a live pace.

Mastering Takedowns: How to Defend a Headlock
A wrestling headlock catches a lot of wrestlers off guard. Let’s learn how a wrestler can defend a headlock.
I have witnessed numerous veteran wrestlers get thrown in a wrestling headlock.
In my opinion, a wrestler should never get thrown in a headlock after he was wrestled for a couple of years.
No Wrestler should go looking for Headlocks
Any decent wrestler knows how to defend a headlock. I have seen kids that were extremely good at headlocks, but most wrestlers should not be looking for a headlock.
A headlock is a move that young wrestlers use. You see a lot of headlocks in heavyweight wrestling. The only time an older wrestler should use a headlock is if it is blatantly given to him by his opponent or if a wrestler is behind and needs a home run to win a wrestling match
The Pitfalls of Head Hunting
In the world of wrestling, the headlock has long been considered a fundamental move, especially among younger athletes. While it may be tempting to rely on this technique, seasoned wrestlers understand the importance of restraint and strategic thinking in utilizing the headlock. In this article, we delve into the reasons why wrestlers, regardless of their skill level, should exercise caution when considering the headlock as their go-to move.
It’s undeniable that the headlock holds a certain allure, particularly for novice wrestlers. It’s a move that’s relatively easy to learn, and its execution appears straightforward. However, the reality is that any decent wrestler can adeptly defend against a headlock, rendering it less effective than one might initially think.
Young wrestlers often find themselves drawn to the headlock, showcasing their enthusiasm and eagerness to engage in the sport. It’s a move commonly witnessed in the heavyweight division, where raw power and physicality can sometimes overshadow strategic finesse. However, as wrestlers progress in their skill levels, a critical shift in approach becomes necessary.
For most wrestlers, relying on the headlock as a primary move is ill-advised. The move’s limitations become apparent as opponents become more seasoned and skillful. As the level of competition increases, the headlock transforms from a reliable technique to a risky gamble that could leave a wrestler vulnerable to counterattacks.
While younger wrestlers may experiment with the headlock as part of their learning process, it’s crucial for older, more experienced athletes to exercise discretion. Utilizing a headlock should be a deliberate decision, reserved for specific scenarios where its use is justified. Older wrestlers should be cautious not to fall into the trap of over-relying on a move that becomes increasingly less effective against skilled opponents.
One of the critical aspects of wrestling is strategic timing. A headlock should only be employed when the opportunity is unmistakably presented by the opponent. Wrestlers should resist the urge to force a headlock in situations where it isn’t naturally available. Instead, focus on honing a diverse set of techniques to maintain adaptability and keep opponents guessing.
For older wrestlers, the headlock should be viewed as a last resort—a move to be employed when circumstances demand a bold, decisive action. Whether a wrestler finds themselves behind on points or facing a particularly challenging opponent, the headlock can serve as a potential game-changer. However, it should not be the default option but rather a strategic choice made with careful consideration.
In the complex and dynamic world of wrestling, a well-rounded skill set is essential for success. Wrestlers, regardless of their experience level, should recognize the limitations of the headlock and avoid the temptation of head hunting. By embracing a strategic and adaptable approach, athletes can navigate the mat with confidence, minimizing risks and maximizing their chances of victory.
Wrestlers Should NEVER be thrown from a Headlock
A wrestler should be learning how to defend a headlock in their first or second year of wrestling.
Learning how to defend a headlock is key to learning how to be a good wrestler.
Defending a headlock should be entrenched in a wrestler so he doesn’t even think about it. As soon as he feels his opponent grabbing this head, he should automatically go into defense mode.
Wrestling Coaches – Teach Headlock Defense Often
If you are a wrestling coach, you should teach your wrestlers how to defend a headlock as soon as you see one of your wrestlers get thrown with a headlock.
In fact, I would recommend adding headlock defense into your chain wrestling drills.
Having your wrestlers do situation drills where they defend a headlock will help them when they see headlocks in a real match.
Techniques to Defend a Wrestling Headlock
Here some of the tips on how a wrestler can avoid being thrown in a headlock.
Here is a great video by Mike Krause from NXT LVL Wrestling Academy.  I like the way he teaches headlock defense.

The Front Headlock is a very dangerous position for the defensive guy, and an extremely controlling position for the guy on offense. Whenever your opponent is hanging his head down a little you can snap his head down. You can also get this if your opponent takes a bad shot and you sprawl good enough that he's not on your legs or barely has them. It's very easy to control your opponent with a Front Headlock and if used correctly you should be able to get a takedown.
You will pull his head underneath your chest. Grab the chin with your right hand while keeping your elbow high so it's harder for him to grab it. Your arm should be fairly shallow. You can even grip the neck, making your elbow even harder to reach. Your right shoulder should be digging into his trap muscle on the left side of his neck. With your left hand, you'll grab the opposite arm and lift it up. Keeping one of his arms elevated makes it so he can only use one to either support himself or defend his position. If you stuff his arm above his head it will warm his upper-body and make him especially uncomfortable. You can be over the arm or underneath it, but we recommend being over unless you're trying to get a Cement Job and other related moves.
Ideally, you'll want to snap him down to the mat and finish from there. You have more control on the mat than on your feet.
Front Headlock On Feet
You'll have the Front Headlock, but both you and your opponent will be standing on your feet. So this is before you snap him down to the mat. Usually you'll get here while hand-fighting or if he takes a bad shot but doesn't fully commit and you snap the head under your chest. You can control this by lifting the arm up with your arm on the outside, or by having your arm under his arm (Under-Hook, Cement Job). I recommend you try to keep your hand on the outside to lower the chances of him grabbing both elbows and forcing a stalemate.
Front Headlock Defense On Feet
Your head is stuck under his chest so he has a Front Headlock. The goal is to get out of this position as soon as possible before it gets any worse. You can shoot out of most tie-ups, but for this one I want you to get out of it first before you attack. These moves have that goal in mind. If you try to shoot under a Front Headlock there's a very good chance that an experienced wrestler will feel this start to happen and he'll sprawl on you, making the situation worse for yourself. Do not dig yourself a bigger hole. Do not get into a false sense of security thinking that moves that work against bad wrestlers will work against good wrestlers. Remember: your style should not change depending on who you're wrestling. You need to have consistent and good technique if you want to win consistently. Don't use bad technique just because you can. Develop good habits that you'll need to use against good wrestlers.
Front Headlock On The Mat
This would be when you have the Front Headlock but down on the mat. Your opponent will be on his hands and knees, you should be off of your knees to improve your mobility and to put more pressure or weight on your opponent. You can snap his head down repeatedly (bounce the head) to break him down and keep his weight on his hands, but don't do it too often or too aggressively or you'll end up giving up Unnecessary Roughness call.
Front Headlock Defense On The
When you're on the mat and stuck in a Front Headlock, you should probably grab an elbow and pull it down as soon as you can. This will secure your position a little bit and give you time to improve your situation. It'll also limit the amount of attacks the top wrestler can use and it will keep him in front of you. You can grab the chin hand with two hands and post it down, but it's a little bit more dangerous because the top guy has a lot more mobility in this situation compared to when you're on your feet. He can start to spin around you and with his weight on you it's harder to match his rotation. Grabbing the elbow solves this a little better.
Front Headlock Short Offense
To me this means you'll be keeping your arms short, hands over top of the head and/or shoulders. This way your opponent cannot grab your elbows and slow you down in this position. You'll have a lot more mobility, but you will have less control of your opponent. Make sure you keep your hips low, knees off the mat, feet wide and back. You don't want to run into a random shot, and you don't want to lose him completely.",0.91857,Mastering the Front Headlock: Combat Sports Skills Upgrade,https://blog.spartacus-mma.com/front-headlock/,"The front headlock is more than just a move; it's a game-changer in combat sports.

FAQs
What is a front headlock in combat sports?
A front headlock in combat sports is a grappling technique where one fighter wraps their arm around the opponent’s neck from the front, often coupling it with a hand grip behind the head. This move is used to control the opponent’s posture, limit their movement, and set up various attacks or transitions.
How do you properly execute a front headlock?
Proper execution involves swiftly sliding one arm under the opponent’s chin and around their neck, securing the back of their head with the hand of that arm. The other hand assists by either grabbing your own wrist or applying pressure on the opponent’s back or arm. The key is to maintain tight control and pressure, keeping your hips close to the opponent to prevent them from gaining leverage.
What are the key grips for a front headlock?
The most common grips are the palm-to-palm grip, where the hands are clasped together, and the Gable grip, named after wrestling legend Dan Gable, which involves interlocking hands without the thumbs. Each grip offers different control and pressure advantages.

Common mistakes include not securing the head tightly enough, allowing the opponent to slip out; positioning your legs too close, making yourself vulnerable to takedowns; and neglecting to control the opponent’s body, reducing the effectiveness of the hold.
How can you defend against a front headlock?
Defense involves preventing the opponent from securing a deep grip. This can be done by keeping your head up and back straight, using your hands to control their attacking arm, and looking for opportunities to move to a safer position. Training in escape techniques is also crucial.

Effective drills include practicing the entry from different positions, holding the grip against resistance, and transitioning to other techniques from the front headlock. Partner drills, where one person attempts to escape while the other maintains control, are particularly beneficial.

Positioning is crucial. Proper alignment of your body, especially your hips and legs, determines your balance and ability to apply pressure. Being too upright can make you vulnerable, while proper angling can increase control and effectiveness.

Drilling is a huge part of getting better in wrestling. The more you go through specific patterns and movements, the more they will be ingrained into your mind and body so when the time comes in a match for you to hit a move, you won’t need to think about it; you will just react. To get better at different skills, you need to do different drills that put an emphasis on specific areas. Here are some awesome wrestling drills.
Stance and Motion
One of the most important drills you can do in wrestling is a stance and motion drill. It is so important to not only have a great stance, but to also be able to move around correctly in it. In wrestling, everything on your feet stems from a good stance.
All of you offense starts with a good stance. When you are in a good wrestling stance with your head up, elbows in, and good knee and hip bend, you are putting yourself in a great position to shoot a shot. If your head is down and elbows are out and your butt is way up high, any shot you take will result in failure if it is against a good opponent because you are already in terrible position before you start.
To get better at stance and motion, the best thing to do is move around in your stance and shadow wrestle. Basically, pretend there is an opponent in front of you and circle, change you level, move forward and back, and sprawl. Get used to moving all around while keeping excellent position. If you really want to improve, you can take a video of yourself moving around in your stance and watch it to see the areas you need to work on the most.
Here is a great video by Mike Malinconinco where he goes over how to improve your stance and motion.

Stance and First Contact
Another area that is great to drill is stance and first contact. It is important to practice how you are going to engage your opponent when you first step out onto the mat. If you stand up and reach, you are opening up for your opponent to shoot and easy shot on you. It may sound simple to maintain a good stance and keep your elbows in and not just reach up for the head, but in reality, this is something that happens way too often in matches.
To do this drill, get a partner and get in your stances and practice keep your arms down until you make contact with your head first, then you can transition into hand fighting. It is a simple drill, but if you can teach yourself to not reach up for your opponent’s head, it will make a big difference.
Check out this video of Kyle Dake where he goes over the importance of stance and making first contact correctly.
Bicep Tie Drill
In wrestling, you need to be able to move your opponent around. One of the best ways to do this is with an inside tie, also called a bicep tie. A great drill you can do is grab a partner and work on moving your partner around using the bicep tie. When you get more comfortable with it, you can even throw in different variables like having your partner shoot on you to make sure you are staying in good position or you can work to get them to step with a certain leg and take a shot. Another great way to do this drill is to start in your stance, make good first contact, then hand fight to the bicep tie position and move your opponent around from there.
Here is a great video of Ben Akren showing the bicep tie drill.
Shot Drills
After you have your stance and motion down, the next thing you want to drill is your shot. In order to earn takedowns, your shot must be on point from start to finish. There are some key points when hitting a shot that will help you to have more success and these drills help you develop the proper technique when taking a shot.
The first key point is you must lower your level. Lowering your level helps you to get past your opponent’s first line of defense and puts you in a great position to drive your opponent back which leads to the second key point, you must drive through your opponent, not to your opponent. When you take a shot, let's say a double leg, you should be moving your opponent backwards, if you aren’t, you are not shooting through them. Another key point is you must lower your level. Changing your level and getting low helps you to go under your opponent’s first line of defense and puts you in an explosive position to drive through your opponent.
Check out this video of Henry Cejudo where he goes over a couple different shot drills that will help you improve your takedowns.
Defense Reaction
You not only need to do offensive drills, but also defensive drills as well. One way to get better at defense is to do reaction drills that train you to pick up on attacks quicker so you can defend them quicker. These drills will help to increase foot speed and also improve how quick you sprawl when you get shot on. Here is another video with Henry Cejudo where he shows a couple different reaction drills you can use to become better defensively.
Hip Heist Drill
A hip heist is a very important movement in wrestling. It is when you switch the direction your hips are facing, either up or down, but don’t move laterally. Common place you see people using a hip heist in a match are when they are trying to create movement on the bottom or if they are in a scramble and need to quickly switch the position of their hips.
In this video, Mike Malinconinco goes over a couple different hip heist drills you can do that will help you improve your hip speed and power.
Although many of these drills may seem basic, they are very important. In fact, pretty much all NCAA wrestlers and even Olympians due drills like this at almost every practice; you are never too good to stop working on your fundamentals and if you were to talk with many of these high level guys, they would tell you that one of the reasons they have had so much success in wrestling is because they spend a lot of time working on the small details that these drills help to improve upon.

Drill these movements repeatedly multiple times a week, and you'll be shooting like a high-level wrestler in no time. 2) The Single-Leg Takedown.","10 Wrestling Moves And Techniques You Should Master
Wrestling is one of the most popular martial arts worldwide, and it’s been around as far back as 3000 BC. It’s a grappling-based martial art that focuses on putting your opponent on the ground, controlling their body, and pinning them.
Wrestling is also an effective martial art for self-defense, and many view it as one of the best bases for mixed martial arts – the most permissive combat sport in the world that allows many of the techniques you might have to deal with in self-defense situations.
There are countless techniques used in wrestling, with some being more effective than others. This article will examine some of the most effective wrestling moves and techniques you should master. Many of these techniques carry over to other grappling-based martial arts like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and Judo.
Ten Wrestling Moves You Should Master
Ready to improve your wrestling skills? Let’s dive right into our list of techniques you should master:
1) The Penetration Step
The penetration step is the foundation for many takedowns used in wrestling like the single and double leg takedown. The technique is performed to put you in a position to grab onto your opponent and take them to the canvas.
Any competent wrestling school gets their students to drill this technique regularly unless the rules of the specific wrestling style forbid takedowns that target the leg, as is the case with Greco-Roman wrestling.
Practice the penetration step often until it becomes part of your muscle memory so you can execute the technique smoothly and quickly. The technique starts in your stance with your lead leg slightly in front of your rear foot and your torso a little bit bent at your hips.
Here’s how to perform the penetration step:
2) The Single-Leg Takedown
The single-leg takedown is one of the most commonly used techniques in wrestling, and that’s because it’s highly effective. There are several variations of the single-leg takedown, but they all involve targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and dragging them to the ground. There’s also the high crotch – commonly known as the hi-C single-leg technique that involves targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and using the hold to pick them off the ground and throw them to the floor.
The high single-leg takedown is the easiest type of single-leg attack to learn since you don’t need to perform a penetration step before shooting in on your opponent’s leg
Here’s how to perform a conventional high single-leg takedown:
Here’s how to complete a conventional single-leg takedown
Figure out which single-leg attacks work best for you and incorporate them into your wrestling game. These techniques are highly effective in wrestling settings and other grappling arts like BJJ.
3) Double-Leg Takedown
Double-leg takedowns are another popular technique used in wrestling. It’s a more interesting technique than the single leg, as it involves rapidly changing levels and exploding forward into your opponent. There are many ways to set up double-leg takedowns, like head snaps, hand ties, and misdirection.
These techniques are more effective when you catch your opponent with both legs close to each other, allowing you to wrap and lock your arms around them.
Shooting in is the building block for many wrestling takedowns, including double-leg techniques. Drill it frequently when you train to make your takedowns more effective. The faster and smoother your penetration step is, the more likely you’ll be able to complete takedowns when you shoot for them.
Here’s how to perform a double-leg takedown:
4) Sprawl
Sprawling is one of the fundamental defensive techniques used in wrestling, and it’s effective at all levels. Takedowns like the single leg and double leg involve wrapping your legs around your opponent’s legs to complete, but sprawling moves your legs out of your opponent’s legs and forces them to carry your weight. Your hand, head, and hips are your first line of defense against takedowns and holds, but you can always sprawl when all that fails.
Here’s how to perform a proper sprawl:
5) Snap-Down
The snap-down is a simple technique that puts you in the top turtle position. The best time to go for it is when your opponent is hunched over as they try to defend against incoming attacks. At that point, there’s nothing to stop their forward posture from crashing.
It’s a popular technique with freestyle wrestlers. Grapplers from other grappling styles, like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, are equally fond of it.
Here are the mechanics of the snap-down:
Besides being a simple way to end up in the top turtle position, snap-downs also open up your takedowns since both techniques require your opponent to do opposing things to defend against them. Your opponent needs to move their legs away from you to defend against takedowns which opens them up to the snap-down. Conversely, your opponent must pull their torso backward to defend against the snap down, leaving them vulnerable to takedown attempts.
6) Whizzer
The whizzer is another effective defensive move that all wrestlers should master. When you’re not in a position to sprawl out of a takedown attempt, the whizzer is your next line of defense. The technique involves securing a deep overhook on your opponent’s nearest hand as they try to complete a takedown.
Securing a whizzer puts lots of pressure on your opponent’s shoulder, and that’s often enough to discourage them from completing takedowns. You can also use the whizzer to drive your opponent to the ground in a half-nelson by wrapping your free hand around their neck, or you can execute a hip toss.
7) Switch
The switch is one of the fundamental techniques used to reverse disadvantageous positions in wrestling. A completed switch puts you in a dominant position or gets you back to your feet. Unlike escapes which only earn you a point in a wrestling match, reversals like the switch get you two points.
Here’s how to perform the technique:
8) Sit-Out
The sit-out is another fundamental defensive technique you can use to escape from bottom positions. At times, you can also use the technique to drag your opponent to the bottom.
Here’s what the mechanics look like:
9) Front-Quarter Nelson
The front-quarter nelson is a handy wrestling technique that carries over into other grappling arts. It’s an effective way to transition to a dominant position after stuffing an opponent’s takedown attempt with a sprawl.
To perform a front-quarter nelson:
10)  Chicken Wing (Armbar)
The chicken wing is one of the most uncomfortable things you can do to your opponent from top position. It’s also one of the most reliable holds for wearing down opponents and pinning them. Also known as the armbar in wrestling, the chicken wing gives your multiple options once you’ve secured the hold.
Here’s what the technique looks like:

When it comes to combat sports, strength and conditioning training is most beneficial in wrestling. To succeed, you need the physical prowess to control and dominate an opponent of comparable stature and the mental toughness to not stop attacking until victory is achieved.
To give you an advantage in wrestling, I am providing you with the top workouts, exercises, and an analysis of the most critical physical metrics.
15 Best Strength & Conditioning Exercises For Wrestling
Shadow Wrestling
Mastering shadow wrestling requires diligent practice of the fundamentals during proper work-to-rest intervals. Many videos online demonstrate fundamental wrestling drills ideal for low- and high-intensity solo training.
Effective practice involves focusing on posture, movement, and offensive and defensive maneuvers in a planned or spontaneous sequence.
The intensity of your workout is determined by the physical adaptations and energy systems you want to target.
A slower pace with shorter rest times focuses predominantly on aerobic energy production, whereas a faster pace with longer rest periods increases anaerobic energy production.
If you can practice with a partner, you can improve your training by including partner drills, which allow for more direct application of techniques.
If you have a grappling dummy, use it to practice repeated takedown drills.
Rope Climbs
The rope climb is highly effective for wrestlers since it improves upper body strength, grip, and endurance.
This exercise develops the arms, shoulders, and back, providing a complete workout that is especially good for the physical demands of wrestling.
Squats
The squat is widely regarded as the best lower-body exercise working the glutes and quadriceps, albeit its efficiency depends on back strength. There are numerous varieties, including back, front, and Zercher squats.
Your previous injuries, training phase, and personal comfort with the exercise will determine your choice. Personally, I like the front squat, and here's how it's done.
Trap Bar Deadlifts
The deadlift is a crucial lower-body exercise in wrestling training targeting the glutes, hamstrings, quads, and back while improving grip strength.
While I'm wary about incorporating heavy deadlifts into routines since they can be difficult to recover from, affecting subsequent wrestling performance, it's unquestionably a favorite among some wrestlers and, when done correctly, can considerably complement a training program.
Many wrestlers, however, suffer from lower back ailments, which deadlifting can exacerbate. I advise using the trap bar instead of a standard barbell since it reduces lower back strain, and the higher grips limit the range of motion. Here is the technique:
Power Clean
I love combining Olympic weightlifting exercises with wrestling training, but you don't have to focus on thе classic snatch and clean and jerk exercises. Instead, you can go for easier-to-learn weightlifting variations that can efficiently increase strength and power without learning difficult techniques.
The goal is to rapidly lift big weights, bridging the gap between resistance training and wrestling practice. Here's how to do it effectively:
Snatch High Pull
The snatch high pull is my favorite exercise in weight training for building a strong upper back. It requires a concentrated effort from the ground up, utilizing the hips and upper back muscles to propel the barbell upwards toward your chest.
This exercise is a comprehensive full-body strength builder for wrestlers, including a mat return movement similar to the power clean. Here is the technique:
Fat Bar Bench Press
While powerlifters excel in bench pressing, not all approaches may be appropriate for wrestling-specific training. Adopting specific characteristics, such as their setup and leg drive, is advantageous, but changing the grip breadth is recommended for wrestling-specific strength. Here's a step-by-step instructions:
Push Press
The push press, derived from Olympic weightlifting, is essential to a wrestler's strength training regimen. It requires channeling strength from your legs to your hands and arms, similar to many wrestling takedowns. Here is how to do it:
Barbell Row
The barbell row is a powerful strength-building exercise that requires you to balance both your body weight and the weight of the barbell. Personally, I find this exercise difficult, but often, the most despised exercises produce the most significant benefits.
The dumbbell row is an excellent alternative to the barbell, especially when using big weights. Here's how to do a barbell row:
Towel Pull-Ups
Choosing towel pull-ups over the traditional type provides variety to your training. While not required, utilizing towels instead of a bar offers a unique challenge that focuses on hand, grip, and forearm strength, all of which are essential for wrestling in terms of good gripping and wrist control.
If you're new to towel pull-ups, start with a simple dead hang to develop your grip strength.
Jump Squats
Jumps are a great alternative to standard weightlifting routines. It's simple to begin, and you may ramp up the intensity by adjusting the weight. You can use a barbell on your back or hold a trap bar or dumbbells at your side.
Jumps can help you improve your ability to quickly generate force, an essential skill for wrestling. Here's a guide for doing them:
Romanian Deadlift
The Romanian Deadlift (RDL) is essential for anyone looking to strengthen their legs, particularly the hamstrings. It can be done with big loads, delivers a superb hamstring stretch, and efficiently strengthens the glutes and lower back. Unlike the regular deadlift, the RDL starts from the standing position.
To clarify, moving the weight off the floor does not constitute the first repetition of the RDL. Let's look at the proper technique for maximizing hamstring development.
KB Swing
The Kettlebell swing is a dynamic hip extension exercise that results in a swift and intense stretch in the hamstrings and glutes as the kettlebell swings back, followed by a quick hip thrust to activate these muscles.
Even a light 16 kg kettlebell can engage the glutes similarly to hip thrusts with a load equivalent to a 10-repetition maximum.
This is the proper technique:
Sandbag Carry
The bearhug carry, similar to sandbag loading, is a strenuous Strongman exercise that tests your whole body, from your hips to your hands. Regular practice of this workout can considerably improve your endurance. Here is the technique:
Farmers Walk
The farmer's walk is a crucial part of any wrestling training regimen, known for its emphasis on grip strength and upper back conditioning. While farmer's handles are commonly used, kettlebells are also feasible. Here is the method:
Importance Of Strength & Conditioning For Wrestlers
The easiest method to demonstrate the significance of strength and conditioning for wrestlers is to compare elite and sub-elite wrestling competitors.
126 male wrestlers were divided into three categories: top elite, elite, and amateur, with the top elite winning medals at European and/or World Championships, elite wrestlers competing but not winning a medal, and amateurs not competing [1].
A comprehensive array of testing evaluated strength, power, and conditioning. Top elite wrestlers had a 12% higher aerobic capacity than amateurs, except lightweight wrestlers, who showed no significant difference.
During maximal cycling sprint tests, top wrestlers outperformed amateurs in terms of average and peak lower body power.
Elite wrestlers produced 12.5% and 7.5% more peak and average power production, respectively, but only in middleweight.
When comparing top elite and elite wrestlers, the distinctions were not obvious, implying that beyond a certain threshold of physical ability, top-tier wrestlers are distinguished by their technical and strategic talents.
It should be noted the amateurs in this study had less training experience than the elite wrestlers, which may account for their lesser physical talents.
However, these findings are based on a single study, and a wealth of additional information is available.
Wrestling Strength Elite vs. Non-Elite
A four-time World Senior Greco-Roman wrestling champion from Iran, participating in the 55 kg category, performed 30% more pull-ups and 8% more sit-ups than the national average, demonstrating his outstanding muscular endurance ability [2].
When adjusted for body weight, this wrestler displayed more strength in the back squat than national requirements, scoring 1.83 instead of 1.79. However, his bench press performance was marginally lower, at 1.39, compared to the national norm of 1.48 relative to body weight.
Elite Iranian junior wrestlers in the 55 kg weight class exhibited comparable strength, with averages of 1.9 and 1.4 for squat and bench press, respectively, when assessed against body weight [3].
Elite Iranian Junior wrestlers had better squat and bench press values than Division III American College wrestlers, indicating top-tier wrestlers may have more strength [4].
Furthermore, a study of elite Junior Turkish wrestlers examined strength differences between those who made the National Team for the World Championships and those who did not.
Instead of using standard dynamic movements such as squats and bench presses, this study assessed isometric grip, back, and leg strength [5]. Wrestlers chosen for the national squad had a 10% greater grip strength, 12% more back strength, and 7% better leg strength isometrically than non-selected wrestlers.
A 2015 study of senior wrestlers compared elite and sub-elite competitors [6].
Elite wrestlers had over eight years of experience and had competed in at least three international tournaments, whereas sub-elite wrestlers were national finalists who had never competed internationally.
Elite wrestlers performed more bench presses (1.1 vs. 0.9) and squats (1.4 vs. 1.1) proportional to their body weight than sub-elite wrestlers.
A 2011 study intended to uncover physical parameters predicting wrestling performance by comparing elite and amateur wrestlers across weight classes (lightweight, middleweight, heavyweight) [7].
Elite wrestlers had more lean mass and demonstrated 12-26% more squat and bench press strength than amateurs. Their maximum muscle power for these workouts was much higher, ranging from 14 to 30 percent more than amateurs.
Surprisingly, the primary difference in muscle strength and power was not age or training experience but lean body mass.
Top-level wrestlers displayed greater grip strength in the lightweight and middleweight categories, increasing by 6-19%, but this difference was not detected in the heavyweight class. Furthermore, elite wrestlers demonstrated a 7-20% increase in maximal back strength compared to amateurs.
It is obvious dynamic and isometric strength are critical for wrestling performance and should be prioritized in a wrestler's strength training plan.
Wrestling Conditioning Elite vs. Non-Elite
Aerobic and anaerobic performance were measured in elite Junior Iranian freestyle wrestlers, with lower body average power ranging from 330 to 620 Watts and aerobic capacity averaging 50 to 57 ml.kg-1min-1[3].
For context, top-level endurance athletes can have aerobic capacities of more than 70 ml.kg-1min-1 [8], while senior elite wrestlers frequently have average power outputs of around 836 Watts [9]. Exceptionally, certain athletes can produce power outputs of more than 1000 W!
Junior elite wrestlers frequently outperform elite taekwondo practitioners regarding average power relative to body weight, highlighting the importance of lower-body anaerobic strength in wrestling over striking-based combat sports [10].
Interestingly, these young elite wrestlers' lower body power outputs beat those of the German 4000m pursuit World Record holders from the 2000 Olympics [11].
Early research comparing elite and non-elite juvenile wrestlers in the United States found peak anaerobic power of the arms and legs, proportional to body weight, was a significant differentiator. In comparison, aerobic ability was not as important [13].
But how do top-tier senior wrestlers compare to their less experienced peers?
Elite Spanish wrestlers competing internationally showed 11% more peak power than their national-level peers [12]. However, elite wrestlers had only a slight edge in aerobic capacity over sub-elite rivals.
A comprehensive 2011 study of 92 wrestlers from five nations, grouped by experience level and body weight, stands out in this research field [14].
Elite wrestlers in this study had extensive experience and competed in major European and/or World Championships, while amateurs were national finalists.
Elite wrestlers in all weight classes performed better on the Wingate test in terms of absolute and relative upper-body average, as well as peak power.
The significant difference in anaerobic power could be ascribed to top wrestlers' 3-5% higher lean mass, which corresponds strongly with anaerobic peak and median power in such tests [15].
A more recent evaluation of 71 research publications, including 2,124 wrestlers, sought to uncover significant physiological features among wrestlers [16]. The key findings include:
According to the research, elite wrestling performance is defined by the ability to create high levels of anaerobic power and capacity. Improving this requires significant fat-free mass, muscular strength, and power. It should be addressed within a wrestling conditioning program.

Should You Do Strength & Conditioning In-Season?
For both parents and ""lazy"" college wrestlers, not doing S&C during the season is one of the worst decisions they can make.
Strength training should never be stopped during the season. Your risk of injury will rise as the season goes on because you will get weaker and less fit.
If you compete at least once a week, you might not even need to do any additional conditioning, but weightlifting should remain a priority.
It could be once or twice a week depending on how often you wrestle. The following is a sample two day per week sample schedule for a wrestling strength program during the season:
Day 1
A1) Front Squat 3 x 3 @80% 1RM
B1) Fat Close Grip Bench Press 4 x 2 @83% 1RM
B2) Weighted Towel Pull-Up 4 x 5-6 @8 RPE
C1) Sandbag Carry 2 x 20-40m
Day 2
A1) Medicine Ball Scoop Toss 3 x 3
B1) Power Clean + Push Press 2 x 2+2, 1 x 2+1, 1 x 1+1
C1) DB Jump Squat 2 x 5 @10% bodyweight
C2) Explosive Incline Push-Up 2 x 5
Summary
Wrestling strength and conditioning do not have to be complicated. It's all about consistency and doing just enough to foster growth while keeping you healthy enough to wrestle. It's a tricky balancing act involving trial and error.

When it comes to combat sports, strength and conditioning training is most beneficial in wrestling. To succeed, you need the physical prowess to control and dominate an opponent of comparable stature and the mental toughness to not stop attacking until victory is achieved.
To give you an advantage in wrestling, I am providing you with the top workouts, exercises, and an analysis of the most critical physical metrics.
15 Best Strength & Conditioning Exercises For Wrestling
Shadow Wrestling
Mastering shadow wrestling requires diligent practice of the fundamentals during proper work-to-rest intervals. Many videos online demonstrate fundamental wrestling drills ideal for low- and high-intensity solo training.
Effective practice involves focusing on posture, movement, and offensive and defensive maneuvers in a planned or spontaneous sequence.
The intensity of your workout is determined by the physical adaptations and energy systems you want to target.
A slower pace with shorter rest times focuses predominantly on aerobic energy production, whereas a faster pace with longer rest periods increases anaerobic energy production.
If you can practice with a partner, you can improve your training by including partner drills, which allow for more direct application of techniques.
If you have a grappling dummy, use it to practice repeated takedown drills.
Rope Climbs
The rope climb is highly effective for wrestlers since it improves upper body strength, grip, and endurance.
This exercise develops the arms, shoulders, and back, providing a complete workout that is especially good for the physical demands of wrestling.
Squats
The squat is widely regarded as the best lower-body exercise working the glutes and quadriceps, albeit its efficiency depends on back strength. There are numerous varieties, including back, front, and Zercher squats.
Your previous injuries, training phase, and personal comfort with the exercise will determine your choice. Personally, I like the front squat, and here's how it's done.
Trap Bar Deadlifts
The deadlift is a crucial lower-body exercise in wrestling training targeting the glutes, hamstrings, quads, and back while improving grip strength.
While I'm wary about incorporating heavy deadlifts into routines since they can be difficult to recover from, affecting subsequent wrestling performance, it's unquestionably a favorite among some wrestlers and, when done correctly, can considerably complement a training program.
Many wrestlers, however, suffer from lower back ailments, which deadlifting can exacerbate. I advise using the trap bar instead of a standard barbell since it reduces lower back strain, and the higher grips limit the range of motion. Here is the technique:
Power Clean
I love combining Olympic weightlifting exercises with wrestling training, but you don't have to focus on thе classic snatch and clean and jerk exercises. Instead, you can go for easier-to-learn weightlifting variations that can efficiently increase strength and power without learning difficult techniques.
The goal is to rapidly lift big weights, bridging the gap between resistance training and wrestling practice. Here's how to do it effectively:
Snatch High Pull
The snatch high pull is my favorite exercise in weight training for building a strong upper back. It requires a concentrated effort from the ground up, utilizing the hips and upper back muscles to propel the barbell upwards toward your chest.
This exercise is a comprehensive full-body strength builder for wrestlers, including a mat return movement similar to the power clean. Here is the technique:
Fat Bar Bench Press
While powerlifters excel in bench pressing, not all approaches may be appropriate for wrestling-specific training. Adopting specific characteristics, such as their setup and leg drive, is advantageous, but changing the grip breadth is recommended for wrestling-specific strength. Here's a step-by-step instructions:
Push Press
The push press, derived from Olympic weightlifting, is essential to a wrestler's strength training regimen. It requires channeling strength from your legs to your hands and arms, similar to many wrestling takedowns. Here is how to do it:
Barbell Row
The barbell row is a powerful strength-building exercise that requires you to balance both your body weight and the weight of the barbell. Personally, I find this exercise difficult, but often, the most despised exercises produce the most significant benefits.
The dumbbell row is an excellent alternative to the barbell, especially when using big weights. Here's how to do a barbell row:
Towel Pull-Ups
Choosing towel pull-ups over the traditional type provides variety to your training. While not required, utilizing towels instead of a bar offers a unique challenge that focuses on hand, grip, and forearm strength, all of which are essential for wrestling in terms of good gripping and wrist control.
If you're new to towel pull-ups, start with a simple dead hang to develop your grip strength.
Jump Squats
Jumps are a great alternative to standard weightlifting routines. It's simple to begin, and you may ramp up the intensity by adjusting the weight. You can use a barbell on your back or hold a trap bar or dumbbells at your side.
Jumps can help you improve your ability to quickly generate force, an essential skill for wrestling. Here's a guide for doing them:
Romanian Deadlift
The Romanian Deadlift (RDL) is essential for anyone looking to strengthen their legs, particularly the hamstrings. It can be done with big loads, delivers a superb hamstring stretch, and efficiently strengthens the glutes and lower back. Unlike the regular deadlift, the RDL starts from the standing position.
To clarify, moving the weight off the floor does not constitute the first repetition of the RDL. Let's look at the proper technique for maximizing hamstring development.
KB Swing
The Kettlebell swing is a dynamic hip extension exercise that results in a swift and intense stretch in the hamstrings and glutes as the kettlebell swings back, followed by a quick hip thrust to activate these muscles.
Even a light 16 kg kettlebell can engage the glutes similarly to hip thrusts with a load equivalent to a 10-repetition maximum.
This is the proper technique:
Sandbag Carry
The bearhug carry, similar to sandbag loading, is a strenuous Strongman exercise that tests your whole body, from your hips to your hands. Regular practice of this workout can considerably improve your endurance. Here is the technique:
Farmers Walk
The farmer's walk is a crucial part of any wrestling training regimen, known for its emphasis on grip strength and upper back conditioning. While farmer's handles are commonly used, kettlebells are also feasible. Here is the method:

Back arches are important skills to develop in wrestling and you don't need a partner or a wrestling mat to do them. To work on a back arch, simply lay on the floor and get in the back arch position and hold. This will help to develop flexibility in the spine and the hips which is very beneficial in wrestling.","6 Wrestling Drills You Can Do from Home without a Mat or Partner
To get better at wrestling, you have to drill movements over and over until they become second nature so when you are on the mat competing, you aren’t thinking what to do you are just reacting with good technique. Wrestling is unique in that you practice and compete on a mat which most people don’t have at home, but what do you do if you are at home and want to work on your wrestling skills and don’t have access to a wrestling mat or even a training partner? Well there are ways to train and get better even if you are home alone. Here are six wrestling drills you can do from home without a wrestling mat or a partner.
Standups
Standing up from the bottom is a very important skill that any wrestler needs to have. You do not need a mat and definitely do not need a partner to practice stand ups. You can do these in your living room, garage, or even your bedroom. To drill stand ups at home, you do not need to do them fast, in fact drilling moves slow with perfect technique is a better way to learn moves than doing them fast and with sloppy technique. Then, when you have the technique down, you will be able to speed the drill up and still maintain great form.
When drilling stand ups alone, you can practice both an inside leg stand up or an outside leg stand up. Really focus on bocking hands and getting ready to grab hand control. Make sure you hips are under you and you are pressuring back. You can mimic peeling hands off you and turning and facing your opponent ending in a good stance. You can hit it on the right side or the left, each time imagining different scenarios that may unfold on the mat. Another variation you can do is get in referee’s position next to a wall. Then, hit your stand up and use the wall to pressure back in to.
Stance and Motion
Practicing your wrestling stance and motion is an easy drill you can do at home. The more time you spend in your stance overall, the easier it will be to maintain a good stance when you are tired during a match.
All you have to do to practice stance and motion is find an open space. Be sure to switch up your lead legs, you can lower your level, imagine you are blocking a shot, or even face a wall and pretend your shadow is your opponent. Make sure you are staying light on your feet and circling. Since you won’t be on a wrestling mat, you probably don’t want slide your knees across the carpet, but you can practice taking high level singles or double leg shots or duck unders.  If you want to take it to the next level, get some rubber training bands and use those for resistance while you are motioning in your stance.
Drop Steps
Another easy move to practice is the footwork of a drop step or sometimes called a back step which is used in many different types of throws. Make sure you practice on both sides and really focus on sticking your butt way out when you finish. If you don’t know what a drop step is, check out this video where Henry Cejudo uses a drop step to hit a hip toss.
Back Arches and Neck Bridges
Back arches are important skills to develop in wrestling and you don’t need a partner or a wrestling mat to do them. To work on a back arch, simply lay on the floor and get in the back arch position and hold. This will help to develop flexibility in the spine and the hips which is very beneficial in wrestling. If you want to take it to the next level, do wall walk back arches. Stand a couple feet from a wall facing away. Then lean back and use your hands to walk yourself down the wall then back up.

Having a strong neck as a wrestler will help you defend half nelsons, help you maintain a good stance when a guy is trying to snap your head down, and even fight off your back. To do neck bridges, do a back arch, but instead of using your hands, arch up on the back of your head. Then you can flex and extend your neck to help build up the muscles in your neck. Once you feel you are comfortable with those, you can step over to a tripod position and then back to the neck bridge. If you need, fold a towel up and put it under your head for some extra padding.
Agility Drills
Being light on your feet and having good movement in wrestling is important. There are all kinds of drills you can do at home to increase footspeed, balance, and agility. A quick internet search of the words “agility drills” or “foot speed drills” will provide you with more than enough drills to keep you busy. You can purchase an agility ladder for very cheap and do drills with it in your garage or out in your yard.
Pull-ups
The last thing on the list is pull-ups. Now pull-ups aren’t necessarily a wrestling drill like the others on the list, but having a strong back and grips are so important in wrestling that developing these strengths is something you should focus on and doing pull-ups is an easy way to do it. All you need to do is install a simple pull-up bar in your house and you are all set. There are a lot of pull-up variations to keep you from getting bored with them. If you have a pull-up bar at your house, you can literally do them everyday.
Hopefully this list gives you some ideas on ways you can get better even if you don’t have access to a wrestling mat. Doing little drills like this may not seem like much, but if you stick with them they can make a huge difference in your skill level.
If you would like to learn more wrestling drills and technique, be sure to check out Fanatic Wrestling’s video library where you will find world class wrestling instructional videos on all sorts of different techniques from many different wrestler.

1. Strength and Endurance
Wrestlers must have good physical strength and endurance to be able to grapple, hold down opponents and resist the pressure applied by their opponents. Many wrestlers also employ techniques such as the sit-out, which requires a great deal of strength and endurance to execute.
2. Stance
Wrestlers must have good balance and a strong stance in order to stay in control of the match. A good stance also helps wrestlers be agile and move quickly when the situation calls for it.
3. Penetration
Penetration is the act of pushing or driving through an opponent to gain control and initiate the offense. To be successful at it, wrestlers must have good coordination, timing, and technique.
4. Takedowns
Takedowns involve taking your opponent down to the mat to score points. To be successful, wrestlers must have good timing and technique when performing these maneuvers.
5. Motion
Motion is the ability to move quickly and smoothly around the mat while maintaining a strong defense. Good motion allows wrestlers to counter their opponent’s moves and create openings to score points.
6. Lifting
Lifting involves using power and control to lift an opponent off their feet in order to gain a dominant position. Wrestlers must be able to use their strength and technique to lift their opponents in order to score points.
7. Leverage
Leverage is the ability to use one’s body weight to overpower an opponent. Wrestlers must be able to use their own strength and technique in order to gain an advantage over their opponents.
8. Level Change
Level change is the ability to quickly transition from one position to another. Wrestlers must be able to move quickly while maintaining control of their opponents in order to score points.
9. Pummeling
Wrestlers use “pummeling” to rehearse the motion of consistently sliding in for improved grip and setting up takedowns. Partnering up is essential when practicing pummeling; secure an overhook and underhook with each hand respectively.
10. Wrist Control
Wrestling requires a lot of upper-body strength and having control over your opponent’s wrists can give you the leverage you need to secure a takedown. Learning how to control your opponent’s wrists is essential for good offensive wrestling and can be practiced by pairing up with a partner and drilling wrist control techniques.
11. Hand Fighting
Hand fighting in wrestling is used to gain control of an opponent’s wrists. It involves using a variety of techniques such as grabbing, pushing, and pulling in order to gain control and set up takedowns. Hand fighting is an important skill for wrestlers to master and is best practiced with a partner.
12. Back Step
The back step is a key movement for wrestlers. It allows them to change levels quickly and set up takedowns. The back step involves taking one big step back while changing levels and can be practiced with a partner in order to perfect the technique.
13. Footwork
Footwork is essential for wrestlers as it allows them to move quickly and stay in control. Wrestlers should practice their footwork by drilling different combinations such as the jab and cross, or the jab and duck.
14. Back Arch
The back arch is an important defensive move that can be used to counter your opponent’s takedown attempts. The back arch involves arching your back, tightening your core, and pushing against your opponent. This technique can be practiced with a partner in order to perfect the form.
15. Defense
Defense is a crucial skill for any wrestler. It involves using different techniques such as sprawls, bridges, and reversals in order to stay in control and score points. Wrestlers should practice their defense regularly in order to stay sharp.
16. Attack
An attack is an offensive skill for wrestlers to master. It involves using different combinations of moves such as takedowns, trips and throws in order to score points. Wrestlers should practice their attack regularly in order to stay one step ahead of their opponents. A wrestler who doesn’t attack can get a passivity call from the referee, so it’s important to be aggressive and to attack when needed.
17. Conditioning
Conditioning is essential for any wrestler. It involves building strength and endurance which allows wrestlers to last longer in matches. Wrestlers should practice drills such as sprints, push-ups, and squats in order to build their physical strength.
18. Mental Focus
A mental mindset in wrestling is just as important as physical conditioning. Wrestlers need to stay focused and be able to think quickly in order to make the right decisions during matches. Wrestlers can practice visualization and positive affirmations in order to stay focused.
Women Wrestling Skills
The skills required for women’s wrestling are the same as those for men. Women need to develop strong defensive abilities, quick reflexes, and good footwork in order to be successful. They also need to develop strong offensive moves such as takedowns, trips, and throws.
Women wrestlers should also practice their mental focus in order to stay one step ahead of their opponents. In order to be successful in women’s wrestling, it is important to practice all of the skills mentioned above regularly. This will not only give them the confidence they need to compete in matches but also help them become overall better wrestlers.
How to Improve Wrestling Skills
In order to improve your wrestling skills, it is important to practice regularly and focus on the fundamentals. The best ways to do so are:
1. Shadow wrestling
Shadow wrestling is a great way to practice your technique without having a partner. It involves mimicking the movements of an opponent and can be done in front of a mirror in order to perfect your technique.
2. Drill partners
Drill partners are essential for wrestlers as they provide an opportunity to practice with a partner. Doing drills such as takedowns, shots, and escapes with a partner allows you to perfect your technique and get comfortable in different situations.
3. Video analysis
Video analysis is a great way for wrestlers to analyze their performance and identify areas of improvement. Watching footage of your matches and identifying mistakes can help you learn from your mistakes and make adjustments in order to perform better.
4. Strength training
Strength training and cardio improvement for wrestling are also important parts of wrestling. Strength training can help wrestlers build power, speed, and endurance which will be useful in matches. Wrestlers should incorporate exercises such as squats, push-ups, and pull-ups into their training in order to develop strength and power.
5. Dummy drills
Dummy drills are an important part of wrestling and can help wrestlers practice their technique with a partner. They involve using a dummy or another wrestler to practice takedowns, throws, and other wrestling moves. Doing dummy drills can help wrestlers become comfortable with different moves and be able to execute them in matches.
6. Cross-training and competing
Cross-training is one of the best ways to improve wrestling skills as it helps wrestlers become better overall athletes. They can practice other sports such as running and martial arts which will help them become better wrestlers. Competing in matches also provides an opportunity for wrestlers to practice their skills and gain valuable experience.
7. Join a Club or Team
Joining a wrestling club or team is another great way to improve your skills. Being part of a club will give you access to coaches and training partners who can help you become better. You’ll also have the opportunity to compete in tournaments and gain experience from these matches.
8. Nutrition
Nutrition is also an important factor in wrestlers’ performance. Eating healthy and getting sufficient rest are key elements for improving wrestling skills. Eating a balanced diet and getting enough sleep will help wrestlers stay in peak physical condition and perform at their best.
Conclusion
Improving wrestling skills requires a combination of physical and mental training. Practicing the fundamentals, drilling with partners, analyzing the footage, strength training, dummy drills, cross-training and competing, joining a club or team, and following a proper nutrition plan can help wrestlers become better overall athletes. With dedication and hard work, wrestlers can reach their goals and become successful competitors.

Takedown tactics: the science behind wrestling success

Shooting in is the building block for many wrestling takedowns, including double-leg techniques. Drill it frequently when you train to make your takedowns more effective.","10 Wrestling Moves And Techniques You Should Master
Wrestling is one of the most popular martial arts worldwide, and it’s been around as far back as 3000 BC. It’s a grappling-based martial art that focuses on putting your opponent on the ground, controlling their body, and pinning them.
Wrestling is also an effective martial art for self-defense, and many view it as one of the best bases for mixed martial arts – the most permissive combat sport in the world that allows many of the techniques you might have to deal with in self-defense situations.
There are countless techniques used in wrestling, with some being more effective than others. This article will examine some of the most effective wrestling moves and techniques you should master. Many of these techniques carry over to other grappling-based martial arts like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and Judo.
Ten Wrestling Moves You Should Master
Ready to improve your wrestling skills? Let’s dive right into our list of techniques you should master:
1) The Penetration Step
The penetration step is the foundation for many takedowns used in wrestling like the single and double leg takedown. The technique is performed to put you in a position to grab onto your opponent and take them to the canvas.
Any competent wrestling school gets their students to drill this technique regularly unless the rules of the specific wrestling style forbid takedowns that target the leg, as is the case with Greco-Roman wrestling.
Practice the penetration step often until it becomes part of your muscle memory so you can execute the technique smoothly and quickly. The technique starts in your stance with your lead leg slightly in front of your rear foot and your torso a little bit bent at your hips.
Here’s how to perform the penetration step:
2) The Single-Leg Takedown
The single-leg takedown is one of the most commonly used techniques in wrestling, and that’s because it’s highly effective. There are several variations of the single-leg takedown, but they all involve targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and dragging them to the ground. There’s also the high crotch – commonly known as the hi-C single-leg technique that involves targeting your opponent’s frontmost leg and using the hold to pick them off the ground and throw them to the floor.
The high single-leg takedown is the easiest type of single-leg attack to learn since you don’t need to perform a penetration step before shooting in on your opponent’s leg
Here’s how to perform a conventional high single-leg takedown:
Here’s how to complete a conventional single-leg takedown
Figure out which single-leg attacks work best for you and incorporate them into your wrestling game. These techniques are highly effective in wrestling settings and other grappling arts like BJJ.
3) Double-Leg Takedown
Double-leg takedowns are another popular technique used in wrestling. It’s a more interesting technique than the single leg, as it involves rapidly changing levels and exploding forward into your opponent. There are many ways to set up double-leg takedowns, like head snaps, hand ties, and misdirection.
These techniques are more effective when you catch your opponent with both legs close to each other, allowing you to wrap and lock your arms around them.
Shooting in is the building block for many wrestling takedowns, including double-leg techniques. Drill it frequently when you train to make your takedowns more effective. The faster and smoother your penetration step is, the more likely you’ll be able to complete takedowns when you shoot for them.
Here’s how to perform a double-leg takedown:
4) Sprawl
Sprawling is one of the fundamental defensive techniques used in wrestling, and it’s effective at all levels. Takedowns like the single leg and double leg involve wrapping your legs around your opponent’s legs to complete, but sprawling moves your legs out of your opponent’s legs and forces them to carry your weight. Your hand, head, and hips are your first line of defense against takedowns and holds, but you can always sprawl when all that fails.
Here’s how to perform a proper sprawl:
5) Snap-Down
The snap-down is a simple technique that puts you in the top turtle position. The best time to go for it is when your opponent is hunched over as they try to defend against incoming attacks. At that point, there’s nothing to stop their forward posture from crashing.
It’s a popular technique with freestyle wrestlers. Grapplers from other grappling styles, like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, are equally fond of it.
Here are the mechanics of the snap-down:
Besides being a simple way to end up in the top turtle position, snap-downs also open up your takedowns since both techniques require your opponent to do opposing things to defend against them. Your opponent needs to move their legs away from you to defend against takedowns which opens them up to the snap-down. Conversely, your opponent must pull their torso backward to defend against the snap down, leaving them vulnerable to takedown attempts.
6) Whizzer
The whizzer is another effective defensive move that all wrestlers should master. When you’re not in a position to sprawl out of a takedown attempt, the whizzer is your next line of defense. The technique involves securing a deep overhook on your opponent’s nearest hand as they try to complete a takedown.
Securing a whizzer puts lots of pressure on your opponent’s shoulder, and that’s often enough to discourage them from completing takedowns. You can also use the whizzer to drive your opponent to the ground in a half-nelson by wrapping your free hand around their neck, or you can execute a hip toss.
7) Switch
The switch is one of the fundamental techniques used to reverse disadvantageous positions in wrestling. A completed switch puts you in a dominant position or gets you back to your feet. Unlike escapes which only earn you a point in a wrestling match, reversals like the switch get you two points.
Here’s how to perform the technique:
8) Sit-Out
The sit-out is another fundamental defensive technique you can use to escape from bottom positions. At times, you can also use the technique to drag your opponent to the bottom.
Here’s what the mechanics look like:
9) Front-Quarter Nelson
The front-quarter nelson is a handy wrestling technique that carries over into other grappling arts. It’s an effective way to transition to a dominant position after stuffing an opponent’s takedown attempt with a sprawl.
To perform a front-quarter nelson:
10)  Chicken Wing (Armbar)
The chicken wing is one of the most uncomfortable things you can do to your opponent from top position. It’s also one of the most reliable holds for wearing down opponents and pinning them. Also known as the armbar in wrestling, the chicken wing gives your multiple options once you’ve secured the hold.
Here’s what the technique looks like:

Mastering the Art of Takedowns in Freestyle Wrestling: A Comprehensive Guide
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling. If you are passionate about this dynamic combat sport and want to enhance your skills in taking down opponents, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we will delve into the essential techniques, strategies, and training drills that will empower you to dominate your opponents on the wrestling mat. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your takedown abilities, this guide is designed to provide you with valuable insights and expert advice to take your freestyle wrestling game to the next level.
Understanding the Basics of Takedowns
Takedowns are a fundamental aspect of freestyle wrestling. They involve swiftly and strategically taking down your opponent to gain control or score points. Understanding the basics of takedowns is crucial for any wrestler looking to excel in this dynamic sport.
Different Types of Takedowns
Single Leg Takedown: This is one of the most common takedown techniques used in freestyle wrestling. It involves grabbing one of your opponent’s legs and swiftly driving them off balance to bring them down to the mat.
Double Leg Takedown: Similar to the single leg takedown, the double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent’s legs and using your body weight to knock them off balance and bring them down.
High Crotch Takedown: This takedown technique requires you to shoot in towards your opponent’s legs, driving your shoulder into their midsection. From there, you can lift and maneuver them to the ground.
Fireman’s Carry: The fireman’s carry is a more advanced takedown that involves throwing your opponent over your shoulder while maintaining control of their upper body. It requires good timing and technique but can be highly effective when executed correctly.
Strategies for Setting up Takedowns
Establishing Control: Before attempting a takedown, it’s essential to establish control over your opponent. This can be achieved through hand fighting, maintaining good posture, and creating angles to disrupt their balance.
Creating Openings: Look for opportunities to create openings for takedowns by feinting or faking attacks. This can force your opponent to react, opening up opportunities for you to execute a takedown.
Using Combinations: Utilize combinations of attacks to keep your opponent guessing and off balance. By chaining together different takedown attempts, you can increase your chances of successfully executing a takedown.
Key Techniques for Executing Takedowns
Level Change: A crucial aspect of executing a successful takedown is the ability to change levels. This involves lowering your body position while maintaining good posture, making it harder for your opponent to defend against your takedown attempts.
Explosiveness and Speed: Takedowns require explosive and quick movements. By training your explosiveness and speed through drills and exercises, you can enhance your ability to execute takedowns effectively.
Maintaining Balance: It’s important to maintain your own balance throughout the takedown process. This allows you to stay in control and quickly transition to other techniques if necessary.
Finishing the Takedown: Once you have initiated a takedown, focus on finishing it strong. This involves driving through your opponent, using your entire body to maintain control, and securing a dominant position on the mat.
Mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling takes time, practice, and a deep understanding of the basics. By familiarizing yourself with different types of takedowns, employing effective strategies, and honing key techniques, you can elevate your takedown game and become a formidable force on the wrestling mat.
Developing Strength and Conditioning
In order to excel in freestyle wrestling and master the art of takedowns, it is crucial to focus on developing strength and conditioning. This aspect of training plays a vital role in enhancing performance on the mat. By incorporating specific exercises for building core strength, cardiovascular training for endurance, and emphasizing the importance of flexibility and agility, wrestlers can greatly improve their overall abilities.
Specific Exercises for Building Core Strength
Core strength is fundamental in freestyle wrestling as it provides stability and power for executing takedowns effectively. Incorporating specific exercises targeting the core muscles can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. Some effective exercises for building core strength include:
Plank: The plank is a simple yet highly effective exercise for strengthening the core. Start by assuming a push-up position and then lower your forearms to the ground. Hold this position while maintaining a straight line from your head to your feet. Aim to gradually increase the duration of the hold as your core strength improves.
Russian Twists: This exercise targets the oblique muscles, which are crucial for generating rotational power during takedowns. Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly, keeping your back straight. Hold a weight or medicine ball in front of your chest and twist your torso from side to side, touching the weight or ball to the ground on each side.
Leg Raises: Leg raises help strengthen the lower abdominal muscles, which are essential for explosive movements in wrestling. Lie on your back with your legs straight and your hands by your sides. Lift your legs off the ground while keeping them straight, and then slowly lower them back down without touching the ground. Repeat for multiple sets.
Cardiovascular Training for Endurance
Endurance is another crucial aspect of freestyle wrestling, as matches can be physically demanding and often require sustained effort. Incorporating cardiovascular training into your routine can greatly improve your endurance levels. Here are some effective cardiovascular exercises for wrestlers:
Running: Running is a great cardiovascular exercise that helps build endurance and stamina. Incorporate both steady-state running for longer durations and interval training to simulate the intensity of wrestling matches. Interval training involves alternating between high-intensity sprints and recovery periods.
Cycling: Cycling is a low-impact cardiovascular exercise that can be beneficial for wrestlers. Whether you prefer indoor cycling or hitting the roads, it provides an excellent way to improve your endurance. Vary the intensity of your rides by incorporating intervals or incorporating hill climbs to simulate the demands of wrestling.
Jumping Rope: Jumping rope is not only a great warm-up exercise but also an effective way to improve cardiovascular fitness. It is a high-intensity exercise that engages multiple muscle groups and helps improve coordination and footwork.
Importance of Flexibility and Agility
Flexibility and agility are key components of successful takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Being able to move swiftly and fluidly while maintaining balance is crucial for executing techniques effectively. Here are some important aspects to consider:
Dynamic Stretching: Incorporate dynamic stretching exercises into your warm-up routine before training or competing. Dynamic stretching involves continuous movement through a full range of motion and helps improve flexibility and joint mobility. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, and torso twists.
Plyometric Exercises: Plyometric exercises, such as box jumps or lateral bounds, help improve agility and explosive power. These exercises involve quick and powerful movements that enhance muscle elasticity and coordination.
Yoga or Pilates: Engaging in regular yoga or Pilates sessions can greatly improve flexibility, balance, and body control. These practices also promote core strength and stability, which are essential for executing takedowns with precision.
By incorporating these exercises and emphasizing the importance of strength and conditioning, core strength, cardiovascular training, flexibility, and agility, wrestlers can enhance their performance in freestyle wrestling and ultimately master the art of takedowns. Remember, consistent practice and dedication are key to achieving success in any sport.
Mastering the Mechanics of Takedowns
Proper Stance and Balance
In the world of freestyle wrestling, having a proper stance and balance is crucial to mastering the art of takedowns. Your stance determines your readiness and stability while engaging with your opponent. Here are some key points to remember:
Gripping and Controlling Techniques
Once you have established a solid stance, the gripping and controlling techniques play a vital role in executing successful takedowns. Here’s what you need to know:
Footwork and Timing
Apart from having a strong stance and effective gripping techniques, footwork and timing are essential components of mastering takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Consider the following factors:
By understanding and practicing the mechanics of takedowns, focusing on proper stance and balance, gripping and controlling techniques, as well as footwork and timing, you can elevate your freestyle wrestling skills to new heights. Mastering these fundamental aspects will greatly enhance your ability to execute effective takedowns and gain a competitive edge in the sport.
Countering and Defending Against Takedowns
Recognizing and Reacting to Opponent’s Attacks
In freestyle wrestling, the ability to recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks is crucial when countering and defending against takedowns. Being able to anticipate your opponent’s movements and understand their preferred techniques will give you a significant advantage in defending against their attacks.
To effectively recognize and react to your opponent’s attacks, it is essential to develop a keen sense of observation. Pay close attention to their footwork, body positioning, and any subtle cues that may indicate an impending takedown attempt. By studying your opponent’s patterns and tendencies, you can better prepare yourself to counter their attacks.
Quick reflexes and agility are key when reacting to your opponent’s attacks. As soon as you perceive an incoming takedown attempt, you must swiftly adjust your stance and position yourself to neutralize their attack. Maintaining a low center of gravity and keeping your balance will make it harder for your opponent to execute a successful takedown.
Effective Counter Techniques
Having a repertoire of effective counter techniques will greatly enhance your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are a few techniques that can be utilized to counter your opponent’s attacks:
Sprawl: The sprawl technique involves quickly extending your legs backward while dropping your hips to the mat. By doing so, you create a wider base and make it difficult for your opponent to secure a takedown.
Whizzer: The whizzer, also known as an overhook, is a defensive move where you use your arm to control your opponent’s attacking arm. This technique allows you to redirect their momentum and potentially gain an advantageous position.
Front Headlock: When your opponent attempts a takedown, you can react by securing a front headlock. This move involves wrapping your arms around your opponent’s head and controlling their upper body, preventing them from completing the takedown.
Granby Roll: The granby roll is an effective technique to counter a takedown and quickly regain control. It involves rolling away from your opponent’s attack while using your momentum to reverse the situation.
Defensive Strategies and Tactics
In addition to individual counter techniques, implementing defensive strategies and tactics can greatly improve your ability to defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Here are some defensive strategies to consider:
Maintain a Strong Base: By keeping a strong and balanced stance, you make it more challenging for your opponent to take you down. Focus on keeping your feet shoulder-width apart and distributing your weight evenly.
Hand Fighting: Engaging in hand fighting with your opponent can disrupt their attempts to initiate takedowns. By controlling their hands and wrists, you limit their ability to secure a successful takedown.
Circle and Angle: Instead of standing directly in front of your opponent, use circular footwork and angles to make it harder for them to shoot for a takedown. Constantly moving and changing angles forces your opponent to adjust and can create openings for counters.
Utilize Defensive Drills: Incorporate defensive drills into your training routine to improve your reflexes, timing, and defensive instincts. Practice scenarios where your opponent attempts takedowns, and focus on reacting quickly and effectively countering their attacks.
By recognizing and reacting to your opponent’s attacks, utilizing effective counter techniques, and implementing defensive strategies, you will enhance your ability to counter and defend against takedowns in freestyle wrestling. Constant practice and refinement of these skills will lead to mastery and success on the wrestling mat.
Strategies for Competition
Creating an Effective Game Plan
Having a well-defined game plan is crucial in freestyle wrestling competitions. It allows wrestlers to approach matches with a strategic mindset, maximizing their chances of success. Here are some key steps to creating an effective game plan:
Study your opponent: Before the match, research and analyze your opponent’s previous performances. Look for patterns, strengths, and weaknesses that can be exploited during the bout. This information will help you develop a targeted strategy.
Identify your strengths: Assess your own wrestling style and identify your strongest techniques and moves. Build your game plan around these strengths to capitalize on your skills during the match.
Set specific objectives: Determine specific goals and objectives for the match. These could include scoring a certain number of takedowns, avoiding specific moves from your opponent, or dominating a particular position. Having clear objectives will keep you focused and motivated during the competition.
Practice your strategy: Once you have identified your game plan, practice it extensively during training sessions. Work on executing your chosen techniques and movements flawlessly to build muscle memory and confidence.
Analyzing and Exploiting Opponent’s Weaknesses
One of the most effective strategies in freestyle wrestling is identifying and exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses. By studying their previous matches and observing their style, you can develop a game plan that targets their vulnerabilities. Here’s how to go about it:
Watch their matches: Analyze your opponent’s previous matches to identify any recurring weaknesses or areas where they struggle. Pay attention to their reactions in different situations and take note of any recurring mistakes they make.
Identify common weaknesses: Once you have observed your opponent’s matches, look for common weaknesses that can be exploited. These could be technical flaws, predictable reactions, or vulnerabilities in certain positions. Understanding these weaknesses will help you plan your attacks accordingly.
Develop counter strategies: Based on the weaknesses you have identified, develop specific counter strategies. Practice techniques and moves that directly exploit your opponent’s vulnerabilities, allowing you to gain an advantage during the match.
Stay adaptable: While it is important to exploit your opponent’s weaknesses, it is equally crucial to adapt your strategy during the match. If your initial plan doesn’t yield the desired results, be prepared to make quick adjustments and capitalize on any new openings that arise.
Mental Preparation for Matches
Mental preparation plays a vital role in freestyle wrestling competitions. It helps wrestlers stay focused, confident, and resilient throughout the match. Here are some key aspects of mental preparation that can enhance your performance:
Visualization techniques: Before the match, spend time visualizing yourself executing your game plan flawlessly. Imagine each move, takedown, and counter in vivid detail. This mental rehearsal helps build confidence and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenges.
Positive self-talk: Replace negative thoughts and self-doubt with positive affirmations. Remind yourself of your strengths, skills, and previous successes. Repeat empowering phrases to boost your confidence and maintain a positive mindset.
Controlled breathing: Deep, controlled breathing techniques can help calm your nerves and reduce anxiety before and during the match. Practice rhythmic breathing exercises to center yourself and stay focused on the present moment.
Develop a pre-match routine: Establish a consistent pre-match routine that helps you get in the right mindset. This routine could include warm-up exercises, visualization sessions, or listening to motivational music. Having a routine creates a sense of familiarity and prepares your mind for the upcoming challenge.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of physical prowess and mental acuity. By strategizing effectively, exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses, and mentally preparing for matches, you can significantly enhance your performance on the mat.
Drills and Training Exercises
Partner Drills for Takedown Practice
One of the most effective ways to improve your takedown skills in freestyle wrestling is through partner drills. These drills allow you to practice your techniques in a controlled setting with a training partner. Here are some partner drills that can help you master the art of takedowns:
Double Leg Takedown Drill: Start by facing your partner in a wrestling stance. Initiate the drill by shooting in for a double leg takedown. Your partner should sprawl and defend while you focus on driving through and completing the takedown. Repeat this drill multiple times, alternating roles with your partner.
Single Leg Takedown Drill: Similar to the double leg takedown drill, this drill focuses on executing a single leg takedown. Begin by gripping your partner’s collar tie or wrist control, then quickly transition to a single leg attack. Your partner should defend by sprawling and countering. Practice this drill with both partners taking turns as the attacker and defender.
Hand Fighting Drill: Hand fighting is crucial for setting up takedowns and gaining control over your opponent. In this drill, focus on developing your hand fighting skills by engaging in controlled sparring with your partner. Work on establishing dominant grips, clearing ties, and creating openings for takedowns. Remember to maintain proper technique and intensity throughout the drill.
Solo Drills for Technique Refinement
In addition to partner drills, solo drills are essential for refining your takedown techniques and improving your overall performance in freestyle wrestling. These drills allow you to focus on specific movements and body mechanics without the need for a training partner. Here are some solo drills that can help you enhance your takedown skills:
Shadow Wrestling: Shadow wrestling involves simulating takedowns and defensive movements without a partner. Stand in front of a mirror or an imaginary opponent and practice your takedown techniques. Focus on proper footwork, hip movement, and penetration steps. Visualize your opponent’s reactions and work on your timing and precision.
Shot Drills: Shot drills are designed to improve your speed, explosiveness, and precision when shooting for takedowns. Set up a series of cones or markers on the ground, and practice shooting from various distances. Start slowly, focusing on proper form, and gradually increase your speed and intensity. Challenge yourself by incorporating level changes and fakes into your shots.
Resistance Band Drills: Resistance bands can be a valuable tool for developing strength and power in your takedown movements. Attach a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point and work on your takedown motions against the resistance. This will help you build explosive power and improve your ability to finish takedowns against tough opponents.
Live Wrestling and Scrimmage Sessions
While drills and solo exercises are essential for skill development, nothing can replicate the intensity and unpredictability of live wrestling. Engaging in live wrestling sessions and scrimmages is crucial for applying your techniques in real-time situations. Here are some tips for making the most of live wrestling sessions:
Focus on Applying Techniques: Use live wrestling sessions as an opportunity to practice the takedowns you’ve been drilling. Focus on executing your techniques against resisting opponents and adapting to their reactions. Pay attention to your positioning, timing, and setups during live situations.
Experiment and Learn: Live wrestling sessions provide a platform for experimentation and learning. Don’t be afraid to try new techniques or variations of existing ones. Take risks, analyze the outcomes, and learn from both successful and unsuccessful attempts. This will help you expand your arsenal of takedowns and develop a well-rounded skillset.
Seek Feedback and Spar with Different Partners: During live wrestling sessions, actively seek feedback from coaches, teammates, or more experienced wrestlers. They can provide valuable insights into your takedown techniques, positioning, and overall performance. Additionally, try to wrestle with a variety of partners to expose yourself to different styles and challenges.
Remember, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires consistent practice, dedication, and a willingness to learn from both successes and failures. By incorporating partner drills, solo exercises, and live wrestling sessions into your training routine, you can significantly improve your takedown skills and become a formidable competitor in the sport.
In conclusion, mastering the art of takedowns in freestyle wrestling requires a combination of technique, strength, and strategy. It is essential to understand the fundamentals of positioning, footwork, and timing to successfully execute takedowns. Additionally, building strength and endurance through regular training and conditioning is crucial for maintaining control and overpowering opponents. Moreover, having a strategic approach, such as setting up takedowns with feints or capitalizing on an opponent’s weaknesses, can greatly increase the chances of success. By continuously honing these skills and incorporating them into one’s training regimen, wrestlers can elevate their performance and become formidable competitors in the sport of freestyle wrestling.

Wrestling drills for youth and high school wrestling help develop essential skills, such as takedowns, escapes, and pinning combinations, while building strength and conditioning for young athletes.
Drilling wrestling techniques stands as a cornerstone in the journey of every successful wrestler. This repetitive and purposeful practice is vital because it instills muscle memory, turning complex moves into second nature. It’s through drilling that wrestlers can refine their form, perfect their timing, and develop the necessary agility and strength required for success on the mat.
Additionally, the process of drilling helps wrestlers understand the nuances of various techniques, enabling them to adapt and improvise during live matches. Drilling fosters discipline and mental toughness, as it demands focus and dedication to improving one’s skills over time.
In essence, drilling wrestling techniques is not just about physical development but also a pathway to mastery, consistency, and winning in the sport of wrestling.
Wrestling, often recognized primarily as a combat sport, transcends its physical aspects to emerge as a true martial art. Beyond the raw power and athleticism, it is a discipline that demands a profound intellectual understanding. On the mat, wrestlers engage in a strategic battle of wit and technique, where every move and countermove is a calculated decision. It requires an acute awareness of body mechanics, leverage, and balance, akin to a cerebral chess match.
Wrestlers must decipher their opponent’s intentions and adjust their tactics on the fly, making split-second decisions that can determine victory or defeat. While the physicality of wrestling is undeniably demanding, its intellectual dimension, characterized by strategy, mental toughness, and adaptability, is equally crucial for those who seek mastery in this ancient martial art.

Position & Balance Drills,Exercises focusing on maintaining proper stance and equilibrium during a match.,What exercises help maintain stance and balance during a wrestling match?,,,,,10 Best Core Exercises for Wrestling (Beginner to Advanced),https://hortonbarbell.com/core-exercises-for-wrestling/,"Position your body in a straight line from the shoulders through the hips, knees and ankles. Brace the core tight. (As if you're going to be punched in the stomach) Do not let the body slouch to the ground nor push the hips up high in the air. Hold for the designated amount of time.","10 Best Core Exercises for Wrestling (Beginner to Advanced)
A strong core is essential for wrestling, and honestly, for any athlete of any sport. A strong core helps transfer power, aids in balance and provides stability. All are important qualities to almost every movement on the wrestling mat, so developing a strong core should be a massive priority for every wrestler.
In this article, I’m going to give you my 10 favorite core exercises for wrestling to help maximize your performance on the mat.
This article contains affiliate links. If you make a purchase using these links I may earn a commission. Thanks.
Core Exercises For Wrestling
I’m going to list all 10 exercises from the most beginner-friendly up to the most advanced. So, whether you’re a complete beginner or an elite-level wrestler, you should be able to find a few exercises to challenge you and help you improve.
Toe Touches
I’m not going to list crunches, because I think we’re all too familiar with those. Instead, I’m going to give you another simple body weight core exercise that is one of my favorites – Toe Touches. Like crunches, Toes Touches are easy to learn and simple to do.
Having to hold your legs vertically in the air forces the lower abs to be engaged making them slightly harder than regular crunches.
But, the reason I really like Toe Touches for wrestlers is it gives insight into hamstring flexibility. Athletes with really tight hamstrings will struggle to get into a proper position and will struggle even more to maintain it.
If this sounds familiar then it’s time to start addressing those hammys.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
Athletes with tight hamstrings may find it hard to keep their legs straight up in the air through the duration of the exercise. Work to keep legs straight and vertical as much as possible.
Keep hands relatively close to the shins throughout the movement. Swinging the arms toward the head at the bottom causes momentum which takes away from the quality of the movement.
Planks
There are so many reasons that I love programming Planks for athletes, especially wrestlers.
First, it teaches and reinforces what it means to brace your core. Knowing how to properly, and effectively, brace your core is so important not only in the weight room but on the mat as well.
Second, holding a plank can sometimes be as mentally challenging as it is physically challenging. I think anytime you can introduce situations (safely!) that get athletes out of their comfort zone and force them to strain is beneficial.
Finally, planks are extremely versatile. You can add weight or time to make them more challenging. You can switch to a side plank to incorporate more obliques and they also work great as a competition to finish a workout.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The biggest mistake that I see with Front Planks is athletes holding the position, but not properly keeping the core engaged and just allowing the torso to slouch. So, while they are technically up on their elbows and toes, all they’re really doing is straining the low back.
The other mistake I see is the exact opposite and that is athletes shooting their butts into the air, resembling more of a Down Dog position.
The difference between the two is the second, having your butt too high, is easier to notice and corrected more often. However, letting the body slouch during a plank is often allowed to pass as ‘good form’ when it is not.
Half Kneeling Cable Chop
The Half Kneeling Cable Chop is easily one of my favorite core exercises for wrestlers because I believe they have an excellent transfer to the mat.
Cable Chops force you to brace your core while moving a weight diagonally across the body. Being able to brace and stabilize against external forces (like your opponent) is critical in wrestling.
Equipment Needed
Muscles Worked
How To
Coaching Points
*This movement is best done with either the rope attachment with the rope slid all the way over to one side or a straight bar attachment with the cable attached to one side.
Keep the torso upright during the movement. If you find yourself (or your athletes) leaning to one side or the other it’s probably an indication that the weight is too heavy. Lighten the weight being used and focus on maintaining that upright position.
Do not rotate through the torso. The goal here is to maintain a braced core and upright body position as you pull the weight across your body.
Seated Med Ball Twist
Seated Med Ball Twists are a staple in my wrestling programming. It’s a simple exercise, but the movement – bracing and rotating – is incredibly transferrable to the mat.
If you want a slightly more advanced version, have a partner stand a few feet to your side and throw the ball back and forth to them.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points (Common Mistakes)
The biggest mistake I see with my athletes when doing Seated Med Ball Twists is moving the ball back and forth primarily with their arms instead of rotating through the core. The focus should be on the rotation. The ball touching the ground is simply an added bonus to the movement.
Speaking of the ball touching the ground – there is no need to bang the ball off the ground as hard as possible for each rep. Stay in control of the movement and the med ball and lightly tap it on the ground.
Med Ball Side Slam
The next few exercises I’m going to suggest all utilize a medicine ball. A medicine ball is an extremely useful tool for developing power, including core power.
The first medicine ball movement is the Med Ball Side Slam. I love this exercise for wrestlers because it involves bracing, rotation and generating power all in one movement.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
First and foremost, test how ‘bouncy’ your medicine ball is before starting. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen athletes almost have their faces smashed by a medicine ball bouncing much harder and rebounding much faster off the ground than they were anticipating.
The biggest mistake I see with Med Ball Side Slams is athletes not utilizing the core and simply throwing the ball down with their arms. The bulk of the force should be generated by aggressively using the core to hinge forward. If done correctly, it should almost (and actually might) lift your feet up off the floor.
Med Ball Side Toss
Med Ball Side Toss is a rotational core exercise utilizing a medicine ball that is fantastic for developing rotational power.
I love Med Ball throwing movements with wrestlers like Slams and Side Tosses because of how dynamic they are and how much power they are able to generate. Definitely beats lying on the ground and doing crunches every day.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The biggest mistake I see athletes make is using their arms (and not their hips) way too much to throw the ball. Power for the throw should primarily come from rotating the hips and torso and the arms should be secondary.
*If you have a partner, you can throw to each other instead of into a wall.
**The distance away from the wall will vary depending on what type of medicine ball you have. If you have a hard rubber medicine ball then be prepared for the ball to bounce a good way back off of the wall. If you have a soft Dynamax-type medicine ball then you can stand much closer as the bounce off the wall will be much less.
Stir The Pot
Stir the Pot is a sneaky hard core exercise that challenges your ability to stay braced and stabilized as your arms shift around on a stability ball.
I love this exercise for wrestlers because being able to stay braced and stabile as your opponent is constantly shifting and changing their position is so critical in wrestling.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
Take your time getting properly set up! If you’ve never done this exercise before it can be surprising just how hard it is to balance yourself on a stability ball in this manner let alone shift in circles.
Make SMALL circles. Trying to go too big with your circles is a good way to end up lying on your back.
Hyperextensions
Too often when players think about doing ‘core work’ they only think of working their abs. However, low back work is just as important, but it’s often either overlooked or just ignored.
Hyperextensions are one of the best movements you can do in a weight room to focus on building a strong low back. Hypers will also work the glutes and hamstrings as well.
If you don’t have access to a Glute Ham Machine, you can try either Supermans or Back Crunches. Both also work the low back and require no equipment.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instruction
Coaching Points
Hyperextensions are surprisingly easy to mess up. One of the easiest ways to make a mistake is going down too fast and “whipping” yourself back to the starting position. As with any exercise, the setup, initial breath before eccentric movement, maintaining control, pausing, and breathing out during concentric contraction are important.
It is important for the lifter to maintain a neutral spine, maintaining tension in the abdomen and upper back. Remember to breathe in and hold the breath during eccentric (lowering your body) and breathe out as you perform the concentric movement (bringing your body back up).
Hanging Straight Leg Raises
Hanging ab exercises like Hanging Straight Leg Raises are some of my absolute favorite core exercises.
Not only are they very challenging ab movements, but they also provide extra benefits as well. They’re a great way to sneak grip strength into your workout and many also work the shoulders, back and biceps as well.
Equipment Needed
Muscles Worked
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The biggest issue that most of my athletes run into when doing Hanging Straight Leg Raises (or any hanging ab exercise for that matter) is how to keep from swinging out of control.
To keep from swinging, you have to actively lower your legs back down. If you ‘let your legs go’ and just allow gravity to take over you’ll completely lose control of the movement. Timing and rhythm are also both important for Leg Raises and you can’t achieve either if you’re not in control of your legs throughout the movement.
Windshield Wipers
By far the hardest core exercise listed here are Windshield Wipers. It is the ultimate in core strength and stabilization. And, not only do they require tremendous ab strength, but they also demand a strong grip and back as well.
If you’ve reached the point where you can rep out Windshield Wipers, you should feel really good about your core strength. (If you want a slightly easier version, try Floor Windshield Wipers)
Equipment Needed
Muscles Worked
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
As mentioned at the top of this guide, this is an extremely challenging ab exercise. I would highly suggest mastering other hanging ab exercises like Hanging Leg Raises before beginning to attempt Windshield Wipers.
Because you’re almost hanging upside down while doing Windshield Wipers, the grip plays an extremely critical role. If you ever feel you’re struggling with your grip AT ALL, you should stop your set immediately.
Final Thoughts
Are these the only 10 core exercises that I like to use with wrestlers? Absolutely not. There are dozens of core exercises to choose from so there is no need to get in a rut of doing the same movements over and over again all the time.
You also don’t have to limit yourself to just bodyweight abs, like crunches and sit-ups, either. Grab a medicine ball or find a pull-up bar and add some variety (and difficulty) to your core routine.
Finally, don’t forget about that posterior chain! Exercises like Hyperextensions, Supermans or even Back Crunches can help strengthen your low back – an important part of your core.

Lay your free hand on your stomach. Placing your hand on your hip (as shown in the featured image above) will help balance you more is a more beginner-friendly hand placement. Keep your feet flat on the floor.","10 Best Exercises for Wrestling To Maximize Performance
When designing a wrestling strength and conditioning program, figuring out what the best exercises are to decrease the risk of injury and improve performance is critical. This is because we’re almost always limited by time.
For collegiate programs, the NCAA mandates how much time is allowed for training each week. But, even if there isn’t a time-limiting rule, we all have things in our life – school, work, family, etc that makes it hard to spend hours on end in the gym.
Figuring out the best exercises that absolutely should be in your wrestling strength program can help you maximize your time in the weight room and to make sure your efficiency matches your intensity.
So, which ten exercises do I think are the most important and why should you care? I’ve spent 20 years working as a sports performance coach and I’ve worked with multiple elite-level wrestlers. I may not know much, but I do know strength and conditioning.
Top Exercises for Wrestling
Power Clean
If I could only pick one exercise to train wrestlers it would be the Power Clean. Power Cleans are basically a total body movement that develops power, strength and coordination.
Want an explosive shoot? The explosive triple-extension of a Power Clean mimics a shoot more than any other movement in the weight room.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
My biggest coaching point for Power Cleans is to just say if you don’t feel comfortable with your technique, then I would refrain from doing them. Wait until you can be properly coached on how to do them correctly so you do not injure yourself.
In the meantime, here are 9 Power Clean alternatives you may be able to try out instead. Some of the alternate exercises I list there are much more beginner-friendly.
Back Squat
I would consider Back Squat the 1B to the Power Clean’s 1A. I think it falls behind the Power Clean, but not by much.
Having a strong lower body is critical to a wrestler’s success and no exercise is better equipped for building a strong lower body than Back Squats.
Yes, there are other effective forms of squatting (there is another on this list) and single-leg movements are very important too (there is one of those on this list as well). But, Back Squats should be one of the primary focal points of your training.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
There are two bar position options for Back Squat, low-bar and high-bar. I recommend and teach the high bar position when working with athletes, including wrestlers.
The most important aspect to watch for when doing Back Squats is the potential rounding of the back. Immediately end any set where form begins to break down and the back begins to round. A rounded back is probably the most common cause of injury with squatting.
One of the most common mistakes is heels coming off the ground. Athletes who are having trouble due to poor ankle dorsiflexion, long femur length relative to their height, or a combination of both, can use a device to elevate their feet such as weightlifting squat shoes, an angled plate, or 2.5lb weights to help address the issue.
Pull-ups
Pull-ups are my favorite upper body exercise for wrestlers.
For beginners, there are modifications that can be made while building the strength to be able to do Pull-ups. Doing Band-Assisted Pullups, Pull-up Holds and Eccentric Pull-ups are all variations that can be utilized until regular Pull-ups can be done.
Once you’ve mastered Pull-ups, it’s just as easy to modify Pull-ups to increase the challenge. Adding weight or controlling tempo are just two ways Pull-ups can be made as difficult as necessary.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instruction
Coaching Points
Take your time and master the pull-up. The benefits of doing sound pull-ups will pay dividends for your shoulder health and the potential to maximize your upper body strength.
By far the biggest mistake I see in the pull-up is lifters not using a full range of motion. Hang all the way down and maintain great tension through the shoulders and abdomen.
Pistol Squat
This was probably the exercise that I struggled with the most making a decision. Single leg work is a critical component of any wrestling strength training program. That’s not up for debate. However, I struggled with which single-leg exercise to pick.
I picked Pistol Squats for my single-leg movement for a few reasons.
First, Pistol Squats are literally done on one leg – no opposite leg to use for assistance whatsoever.
Second, I think you really have to be careful with how much posterior chain volume you place into any strength program. For instance, about half of the exercises on this very list are posterior chain movements. Too much posterior chain work can lead to tight low backs (or worse).
Pistol Squats allow athletes to focus on building true single-leg strength without added low back stress.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
If you cannot do a Pistol Squat the first time trying, don’t worry, you’re not alone. Most athletes I’ve worked with have to start by using a bench for pistol squats. The first thing you need to do to start progressing is figure out where your real weakness is: strength or flexibility.
Some lifters simply don’t possess the strength at first to perform a full pistol squat on air. On the other hand, many of the athletes I’ve coached actually have the strength to do a pistol squat, but they lack the mobility to be able to go through the full range of motion without falling or their opposite foot crashing into the ground.
Single Arm Dumbbell Bench Press
The reason is that SA DB Bench is an anti-rotational exercise. That means that as you bench, the core has to work to keep you from rotating and literally falling off the bench. This utilization of the core is so beneficial for wrestlers who need to be able to maintain core stability while pulling and pushing.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instruction
Coaching Points
If you’re familiar with Dumbbell Bench Press but are new to this single-arm variation, you’ll probably be pretty surprised by just how much you need to brace your core to keep from literally rotating off the bench. For this reason, start light and then work your way up in weight.
This is a very shoulder-friendly pressing movement. Because the implement is a dumbbell, the range of motion is increased, the shear force on the shoulder is decreased, and the shoulder stabilizing muscles are engaged.
Overhead Squat
I absolutely love Overhead Squats for athletes, especially wrestlers.
First, it is the ultimate mobility assessment tool because it demands mobility from almost every part of the body. If there are issues with the shoulders, back, hips or ankles they are going to show up when trying to Overhead Squat.
Second, if you want to see a wrestler that has tremendous shoulder stability, watch a wrestler who can Overhead Squat their bodyweight. It also, by the way, takes a great deal of core strength and stability to do that as well.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
If you find yourself struggling to keep the bar in the overhead position (it keeps falling forward), then you probably have a mobility issue in either the shoulders or thoracic (mid to upper back). Switch to a PVC Pipe until your mobility improves.
Single Arm Dumbbell Snatch
Another explosive exercise that I love for wrestlers is the Single Arm Dumbbell Snatch. It’s easy to learn, it’s unilateral (one side working at a time) and is a great Olympic lift variation to develop power. What’s not to love?
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The dumbbell should travel close to the body all the up until it gets about head height, then rotate the elbow, drop the hips and catch. Don’t allow it to swing forward out away from the body.
The second technique flaw is not staying braced through the return of the dumbbell to the starting position, oftentimes from being in too big of a hurry to knock out reps. Letting the dumbbell, especially the heavier you get, yank the shoulder down at the bottom of the rep is asking for trouble.
Trap Bar Deadlift
I like Trap Bar Deadlifts for wrestlers for a few reasons. First, they’re simply a great exercise for building lower body strength, especially for the posterior chain.
Being able to use a trap bar allows the weight to be shifted slightly more towards the hips which will take a bit of strain off the low back (compared to regular deadlifts).
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
Pro Tip: Don’t have a trap bar? Here are 10 alternatives for Trap Bar Deadlift that don’t need one.
Easily the most common mistake for deadlifts of any kind is allowing the back to round, placing unnecessary stress on the back. Keep the back flat throughout the movement and the core braced.
Do not bounce the bar off the floor between reps. Yes, bouncing the plates off the floor into the next rep may make the lift easier to do, but it’s also a good way to allow your technique to break down. Reset for each rep.
Battle Ropes
Upper-body muscular endurance is critical for wrestlers and nothing trains that better than Battle Ropes. Battle Rope Slams can train your upper body, core and conditioning – all wrapped up together.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
One of the keys to Battle Rope Slams is experimenting to find the optimal amount of slack to leave in the rope. You want enough slack that it doesn’t hinder the full range of motion, but not too much slack that it’s hard to develop a rhythm with the rope.
Make sure whatever you’re using as an anchor for the battle rope is secure. Battle rope movements generate a lot of power and momentum and can come loose easily if not secured in place.
Box Jumps
I couldn’t do an entire list of exercises for wrestlers and completely leave off plyometric training. The problem was which plyometric drill to pick.
I ended up going with probably the most popular and well-known plyometric training drill. Popular, but still extremely effective. Box Jumps.
Box Jumps will help develop explosiveness and take a lot of wear and tear off the joints by landing on a higher surface instead of all the way back to the ground each rep. Just focus on proper technique and avoid trying to jump on boxes too tall to do properly.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
Pick a box that is an appropriate height. You should land on the box in roughly a quarter-squat position. All too often I see athletes jump on a box that is way too high, causing them to have to land in a full squat position.
This is wrong for two reasons. First, picking your feet higher so you can land in a full squat doesn’t actually mean you jump any higher. Second, having to land in a full squat to make it onto the box eliminates any room for error. If you jump perhaps even an inch not high enough you could end up missing the box.
Final Thoughts
There is no shortage of quality exercises that you can utilize for wrestling workouts. However, in my opinion, those are the 10 most beneficial exercises that will help you increase your performance on the wrestling mat.

If you came here to learn wrestling strength training like Triple H and John Cena or how to jump higher off the top rope, you’ve found the wrong wrestling. If we were to refer to South Park, this is strength training for real wrasslin’!
Wrestling likely benefits the most from physicality compared to other forms of martial arts. In fact, an old study concluded that physiological variables (such as strength) are the best way to predict success in elite-level wrestlers [1].
Maximal dynamic and isometric strength are strong predictors of wrestling performance. Elite-level wrestlers possess greater strength than their sub-elite counterparts across all weight classes.
To gain the most accurate understanding of how important strength training is for wrestling, we must compare elite and non-elite wrestlers' strength and power capabilities. If elite wrestlers are stronger in certain areas, we can confidently conclude that they are important for high-level wrestling performance.

Wrestler Strength Training Benefits
Strength training is an essential component of preparing for wrestling, a sport that demands technical skill and a high degree of physical strength, power, speed, and endurance. Here’s why you should strength train for wrestling.
Strength Training Reduces Injury Risk
There is a host of evidence supporting that stronger athletes are more resistant to injury. For example, one meta-analysis found strength training reduces sports injuries to less than a third and reduces overuse injuries by 50% [17].
Further, a 10% increase in strength training volume reduces the risk of injury by more than 4% [18]. Safe to say, hitting the gym can keep you on the mats longer.
Be Able To Train Harder
While being stronger will keep you on the mats longer without injury, it also makes you a more robust wrestler. Stronger wrestlers can handle workloads with less risk of injury and tolerate larger week-to-week changes in training load [19].
A spike in training load is often associated with injury. Meaning if you go from little training to suddenly hours of intense training, being stronger will make you more resilient and able to bounce back faster.
Strength Exercises Increase Strength & Power
Wrestling is a sport of strength and power. Strength is a strong predictor of wrestling performance [1].
5 Step Blueprint To Build A BJJ Strength Workout To Demolish Your Opposition
Learn how to plan your strength training to maximize transfer to the mats.
A well-programmed strength training routine (like in our 12-week off-season wrestling strength & conditioning program) will enhance strength and power without making you slow or “muscle bound.”
Since power is the product of force and velocity, lifting weights targets the force side of the power equation.
Lifting Weights Can Make You A Faster Wrestler
Speed kills in all sports. Wrestling included. Strength is one of the backbones of speed and, when performed correctly, enhances speed alongside strength. If you want to blast double legs easily, get in the gym.
Develop Specific Wrestling Strength
Weight training is typically general preparation for wrestling. However, you can perform exercises closer to representing wrestling movements.
One example is sandbag bearhug carries, which mimics the postures and muscles worked when lifting an opponent.
Another option is the Zercher squat, forcing you to support the weight with your arms and shoulders and maintain an upright posture.
Gain A Mental Edge
Knowing you have the strength to lift hefty poundages and having muscles to show for it is a confidence booster. Having this mindset going into a match can make or break your competition's success.
While exercise isn’t the ideal way to develop mental toughness, having this confidence may give you the extra push during a competitive wrestling match.
Best Strength Exercises For Wrestling
Squat
The squat is considered the king of lower body exercises. It targets the glutes and quads but is limited by your back strength. You have many variations to play with, such as back squats, front squats, and even zercher squats.
What you use depends on your injury history, stage of training, and what you feel most comfortable performing. I’m a big fan of the front squat, and here is how to do it:
Deadlift
The deadlift is another lower body dominant staple exercise within wrestling workouts. It targets the glutes, hamstrings, quads, and back. You’ll also strengthen your grip, which is a bonus. I’m not a huge fan of programming it because heavy deadlifts are hard to recover from, making it tough to wrestle later.
Further, many wrestlers suffer from lower back pain, and deadlifting can make this worse. However, some wrestlers love the deadlift exercise and, when programmed properly, can be a great addition to your workout.
However, I recommend choosing the trap bar over the barbell variation as it reduces lower back stress, and the elevated handles reduce the range of motion. Here’s how to do it:
Power Clean
I’m a big proponent of Olympic Weightlifting movements for wrestlers. It doesn’t need to be the classical snatch and clean & jerk. Weightlifting derivatives are easier to learn and maximize strength and power development without mastering the technique.
Moving heavy loads quickly is the name of the game for maximizing the transfer between resistance exercise and wrestling training. Here’s how to do it:
Jump Squat
Jumping is an excellent alternative to the Weightlifting movements. It has no learning curve, and you can express power with varying loads. You can use a barbell on your back or hold a trap bar or dumbbell by your side.
Jumping improves your ability to produce force quickly, which is a key requisite for wrestling performance. Here’s how to do it:
Snatch High Pull
The snatch high pull is my go-to weight training exercise for building a powerful upper back. You must sequence the pull from the floor, then use your hips and upper back muscles to propel the barbell toward your chest.
It’s the ultimate full-body strength exercise for wrestlers and closely mimics the mat return movement like the power clean. Here’s how to do it:
Weighted Pull-Up
Pull-ups should be a staple within your wrestling workouts. For variation, they can be done with an underhand (chin-up) or overhand (pull-up) grip. You can level them up further by using towels to strengthen your grip. Here’s how to do it:
Barbell Row
The barbell row is an epic strength exercise as it puts you in a bent-over position where you must support your body weight and the barbell. Honestly, I hate doing this exercise. But the exercises you hate give you the most significant gains.
If you don’t want to use the barbell, the dumbbell row is a great substitute when done heavy. Here’s how to barbell row:
Push Press
The push press is another Weightlifting derivative that must be in a wrestler's weight training program. You must sequence the force generated from your legs to your hands and arms like many takedowns. Here’s how to do it:
Sandbag Loading
Sandbag loading is the more specific version of the Weightlifting derivatives regarding wrestling training. Within the power clean, the hips and knees aren’t thrust forward as that kicks the bar horizontally. But this is ideal when loading a sandbag.
It gets you into a similar position to performing a mat return and carrying your opponent on your hips. The awkward sandbag makes it even better. Here’s how to do it:
Sandbag Bearhug Carry
Like sandbag loading, the bearhug carry is a brutal Strongman exercise challenging your entire body from your hips to your hands. You can make incredible endurance improvements with this exercise when done consistently. Here’s how to do it:
Farmers Walk
Of course, no wrestling exercise list is complete without the farmers walk. It taxes the grip and upper back like no other exercise. Farmers' handles are typically best, but kettlebells also make a good option. Here’s how to do it:
Strength Profile Of Elite vs. Non-Elite Wrestlers
Maximal dynamic and isometric strength has been well-researched within the wrestling community. Rightly so, wrestling requires picking up and moving other humans of similar size. Maximal strength in wrestling exceeds values seen in the striking arts but is comparable to other grappling arts, such as judo
[2]. Highlighting the different physical requirements needed for these martial arts.
126 male wrestlers were categorized as top elite, elite, and amateur wrestlers [3]. The top elite won medals at European and/or World Championships. Elite wrestlers participated in these events but didn’t win a medal, and amateurs did not compete.
The researchers found no differences between levels regarding isometric grip strength, back strength, or leg strength, regardless of weight class. However, lower body average and peak power during maximal cycling sprint tests were greater in elite than amateurs.
These differences were not seen between the top elite and the elite, indicating that once a certain level of physical ability is reached, the technical and tactical ability separates the very top wrestlers.
It's important to note that amateurs in this study had less training experience than elite wrestlers, potentially explaining the reduced physical capacity.
But we can’t draw conclusions from one study!
Let's examine a case study involving the Iranian 4x World senior Greco-Roman wrestling champion in the 55 kg weight class [4]. This wrestler completed 30% more pull-ups and 8% more sit-ups than the National norms, highlighting his enhanced muscular endurance qualities.
He was also stronger in the back squat compared to National norms relative to body weight (1.83 vs. 1.79 respectively). However, his bench press was lower at 1.39 vs. 1.48 relative to bodyweight.
Similar strength levels were found in elite Iranian Junior wrestlers in the 55 kg weight class, with an average of 1.9 and 1.4 squat and bench press relative to body weight [5].
In fact, strength relative to body weight was not too different between weight classes, with a general trend of relative strength decreasing as weight classes increased due to the increase in the absolute load of the exercise.
If we compare these numbers to Division III American College wrestlers, the elite Iranian Junior wrestlers showed higher squat and bench press numbers, which potentially indicates that higher-level wrestlers are stronger [6].
Furthermore, research on elite Junior Turkish wrestlers compared strength measurements between those selected for the National Team for the World Championships and those not [7].
While they didn’t measure the traditional dynamic lifts such as the squat and bench press, they measured isometric grip, back, and leg strength.
Selected wrestlers were found to have 10% greater grip strength, 12% greater isometric back strength, and 7% greater isometric leg strength compared to those who weren’t selected for the National training camp.
Looking again at senior wrestlers, a 2015 study compared elite and sub-elite wrestlers where elite wrestlers were those with 8+ years of experience and participated in at least three International events representing their country, while sub-elite wrestlers were finalists in their National competitions but never competed internationally [8].
Elite wrestlers had higher bench presses (1.1 vs. 0.9) and squats (1.4 vs. 1.1) relative to bodyweight than sub-elite wrestlers.
Adding to this body of evidence is a 2011 study that set out to find which physical factors predict wrestling performance by comparing elite and amateur wrestlers by bodyweight (lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight) [9]. Elite wrestlers had more fat-free mass and 12-26% greater squat and bench press than amateurs.
Maximum muscle power was also much higher for these exercises, ranging from 14-30% greater than seen in amateur wrestlers. It seemed that age and physical training experience wasn’t the distinguishing factor regarding muscle strength and power, but rather fat-free mass.
The load that maximized power in the squat was approximately 60-65% 1RM, and the bench press was approximately 34-37% 1RM regardless of weight class, providing some essential, actionable information to inform strength programming.
Elite wrestlers also showed stronger grip strength in the light and middleweight classes, ranging from 6-19% greater, but no differences were seen in heavyweights. Maximal back strength was also much higher in elites than amateurs at 7-20%.
Overall, we can conclude that dynamic and isometric physical strength is important to wrestling success and should be prioritized within a wrestler's training program.
Physical Differences Between Greco-Roman and Freestyle Wrestling
Both Freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling are Olympic sports. Freestyle wrestling is characterized by the use of explosive techniques over a 2 x 3-minute bout. The main distinction is the ability to use upper and lower body wrestling while Greco-Roman only allows upper body techniques
[10]. Do these differences influence the physical profiles of elite wrestlers?
Junior Greco-Roman and Freestyle wrestlers of the Polish National team were compared through a range of physical tests [11]. Freestyle wrestlers showed greater strength endurance of the trunk (sit-ups and side twists) and the upper body (pull-ups and dips).
This may be explained by the number of techniques that can be used to end a match by either using the arms or legs such as various leg locks making it attack-oriented wrestling.
Freestyle wrestlers also possessed stronger bench presses, snatches, and higher vertical jumps than Greco-Roman wrestlers.
A more recent study on junior Turkish wrestlers found slightly different results where no differences were found in strength (grip and back) between wrestling styles except for isometric leg strength being higher in Greco-Roman wrestlers [10].
Perhaps the differences found in these studies could come down to the testing modalities used with the former using dynamic strength endurance tests where the latter used isometric tests. As both wrestling styles require high-levels of isometric strength, perhaps these values won’t differ to the same extent as dynamic movement when freestyle wrestling is considered a more explosive style.
How Wrestling Tournaments Affect Strength
Understanding how a wrestling tournament may impact strength as matches’ progress may provide some valuable insight into strength training preparation. So one study followed Division I freestyle wrestlers who were National and International competitors over a 2-day simulated tournament after a weight cut [12].
Day 1 had 3, 5 minutes matches while Day 2 had 2 matches. As we know, there can be some differences between sparring and competitive matches so to make the environment more competitive, wrestlers were competing for a starting position within their weight class.
Both handgrip and bear hug strength declined from the first match compared to baseline over the 2 days. Vertical jump only declined at the start of Day 2 likely due to the increased concentrations of the muscle damage marker creatine kinase.
Further, reductions in slower velocity and isometric elbow and knee strength were observed throughout the tournament showing slower, maximal strength movements to be more susceptible to fatigue compared to faster velocity movements.
It may be pertinent to emphasize isometric, maximal strength, and strength endurance over higher-velocity strength training due to the high levels of fatigue present in tournaments as well as strength being a major predictor of wrestling success.
Injury Profile Of Wrestling
Starting at the American high school level, the most commonly injured areas were the shoulder (24%) and knee (17%) [13]. Shoulder injuries were mainly rotator cuff muscle strains and knee injuries mainly contusions and meniscus tears. Ankles were the most common joint sprain.
Another study investigating high school and collegiate wrestling found half of the injuries were strains and sprains [14]. Knee (25% & 15%) and shoulder (18% & 18%) injuries were the most common in collegiate and high school wrestlers respectively.
When looking at the Olympic level, the 2008 Beijing Olympics showed freestyle wrestling had the highest injury rates
[15]. Most injuries were cuts (60%) and sprains (25%) with the upper body having more injuries than the lower body.
The 2016 Rio Olympics showed similar findings with the most common injury being cuts and contusions (55%) but with both freestyle and Greco-Roman sustaining high injury rates (36% & 41% respectively) [16].
We can conclude that strengthening the shoulder, knee, and ankles should remain a strong focus throughout a strength training plan for wrestling.
Wrestling Strength Training Program
While there are potentially small differences between freestyle and Greco-Roman, this will be an example of wrestling workouts. Strength training for wrestlers is more than a basic Powerlifting routine.
There are other attributes that must be addressed within the program.
I’ve set this up in two phases, as I've done with the other strength training programs on Sweet Science of Fighting. Phase 1 will focus on developing maximal dynamic strength and sub-maximal isometric strength.
Phase 2 will continue to focus on maximal dynamic strength and maximal isometric strength. However, with some more advanced set/rep protocols. One is using cluster sets to maintain high-quality volume and potentially minimize some of the fatigue from the sets.
Reducing some of the fatigue is essential as a high volume power training (HVPT) approach is taken with the jump squat and bench throw made popular by Alex Natera.
HVPT improves maximal jump performance and the ability to repeat power, which is potentially beneficial for the explosive nature of freestyle wrestling.
I broke down this training protocol in my video below:
This program will focus on a 3-day-a-week model as strength training is more important to wrestling than other martial arts. They may train 3-4 times a week for their sport at least at the collegiate level and even less if it is the off-season. This program will have an off-season focus.

My name is Kase Nipe, and I’m a professional wrestler.
I’ve been in the business for about 2 years now, and it’s been an amazing journey.
Before I started my wrestling career, I had a bar in Fairmount, Philadelphia, for 7 years named Kase’s Box. In the last 2 years of the bar, I started getting interested in wrestling, which took up most of my time.
Eventually, I decided to quit the bar and become a wrestler full-time!

Effective Wrestling Drills to Enhance Your Technique and Dominate the Mat
Wrestling is an ancient sport that has stood the test of time, captivating audiences for generations with its raw display of strength, skill, and strategy. To be successful in this demanding sport, a wrestler must master a diverse range of techniques that allow them to control and outmaneuver their opponents on the mat. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the essential wrestling techniques that every aspiring wrestler should learn and perfect for achieving success in the sport.
The Stance: Laying the Foundation
The stance is the foundation of all wrestling techniques. It involves positioning your body to maximize stability, balance, and mobility.
Here are the key components of a proper wrestling stance:
Feet Positioning:
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, one foot slightly ahead of the other. Distribute weight evenly between both legs.
Knee Bend:
Maintain a slight bend in the knees to stay light on your feet and be ready to react quickly.
Hand Placement:
Keep your hands before you, ready to engage or defend against your opponent.
Head Position:
Keep your head up and your eyes forward to be aware of your surroundings.
Level Change:
Practice moving from a higher to a lower stance to initiate takedowns and defend against opponents’ attacks.
Basic Takedowns: Gaining Control
Takedowns are fundamental moves in wrestling, allowing wrestlers to score points by bringing their opponent to the mat.
Here are some basic takedowns to master:
Single Leg Takedown:
Shoot in on one of your opponent’s legs, gripping it with both hands and drive forward to lift and off-balance them.
Double Leg Takedown:
Engage both of your opponent’s legs, wrapping your arms around them, and drive forward to bring them down.
High Crotch Takedown:
Similar to the single-leg takedown, you position yourself to the outside of your opponent’s leg.
Ankle Pick:
Reach for your opponent’s ankle, grab it firmly, and lift it to take them down.
Escapes and Reversals: Regaining Control
A successful wrestler must also know how to escape from a disadvantageous position or reverse their opponent’s control.
Key techniques include:
Stand-Up:
From the bottom position, explode up to standing while facing your opponent.
Switch:
From the bottom position, switch your hips to reverse the control of your opponent.
Granby Roll:
When your opponent has you on top, use a Granby roll to escape and potentially gain control.
Pinning Combinations: Securing Victory
Pinning your opponent to the mat is the ultimate goal in wrestling, earning you a victory by fall.
Here are some pinning combinations to work on:
Half Nelson:
Control one of your opponent’s arms with a half Nelson from the top position and tilt them onto their back.
Crucifix:
Trap both of your opponent’s arms while on their back, rendering them unable to defend against the pin.
Guillotine:
Control your opponent’s head and arm from the top position, using your body weight to force them onto their back.
Ground Control and Riding: Maintaining Dominance
Being able to control your opponent on the ground is crucial in wrestling.
Learn these techniques to maintain dominance:
Breakdowns:
Use techniques to break your opponent down to the mat from a neutral or standing position.
Riding Techniques:
Once your opponent is down, learn how to maintain control and pressure to prevent them from escaping.
Defense and Counters: Staying in the Game
A successful wrestler is not just skilled in offense but also knows how to defend and counter their opponent’s attacks:
Sprawling:
When your opponent shoots in for a takedown, quickly sprawl your legs back to avoid being taken down.
Whizzer:
Defend against a single-leg takedown by using an overlook on your opponent’s arm and leaning your weight onto them.
Hip Heist:
When your opponent has you on your back, use a hip heist to reverse the position and gain the advantage.
Importance of Conditioning and Drilling
Mastering wrestling techniques requires dedication and conditioning. Regularly engage in drilling exercises to perfect your moves and build muscle memory. Additionally, focus on cardiovascular and strength training to improve your stamina and physical capabilities.
Mental Toughness: The X-Factor
Wrestling is not only a physical sport but also a mental battle. Cultivate mental toughness to stay focused, composed, and resilient during the rigors of competition. Visualization, goal setting, and positive self-talk are valuable tools to enhance your mental game.
Learning from the Best: Seek Coaches and Mentors
Embrace the guidance of experienced coaches and mentors who can provide personalized feedback, strategies, and support in mastering wrestling techniques.

Navigating the Landscape of Leg Wrestling Rules
Commencement and Starting Positions
Leg wrestling matches commence with competitors seated face-to-face on the ground. Their legs are extended outward and their feet touch. This intimate contact forms the basis of the sport, where participants utilize their lower body strength and leverage to gain an upper hand.

The ultimate objective in leg wrestling is to compel your opponent’s foot to touch the ground while keeping your own foot elevated. This requires a delicate balance of power, precision, and strategy. The first wrestler to achieve this feat secures victory in the match.
Hands Off the Ground
While participants begin with clasped hands, hands-off is the rule once the match is underway. Wrestlers are strictly forbidden from utilizing their hands to push or pull their opponent’s leg. This regulation emphasizes the reliance on lower body strength and maneuvering in this unique form of wrestling.

Wrestling is a physically demanding sport that requires a combination of strength, technique, and strategy. One aspect of wrestling that often goes overlooked is the effective use of leg wrestling moves. In this article, we will explore various leg wrestling techniques and maneuvers that can give you an upper hand on the mat. We'll delve into leg rides, leg drops, leg slaps, and defending against leg ride wrestling.
What this article covers:
1. Leg Rides:
Leg rides are a fundamental component of leg wrestling moves. This technique involves gaining control of your opponent's leg and utilizing it as a leverage point for maintaining control and attempting a pin. There are several leg ride variations, including the following:a) Cross Body Ride: In this move, the wrestler secures control of their opponent's leg while maintaining a parallel position. By wrapping their arm around the leg and applying pressure with their body weight, they can control their opponent's movements and look for opportunities to score points or go for a pin.b) Spiral Ride: The spiral ride is another effective leg wrestling move where the wrestler positions themselves diagonally behind their opponent. They maintain control of the leg while applying pressure and using their body positioning to keep their opponent off balance. This technique can help set up other moves or create openings for scoring.

2. Leg Drops in Wrestling:
Leg drops are a powerful offensive move that can catch your opponent off guard and earn you valuable points. It involves using your legs to apply force and pressure on your opponent's body. Here are two common leg drop techniques:a) Leg Lariat: The leg lariat is a high-impact move where a wrestler jumps into the air, extending one leg out, and aims to strike their opponent's upper body or head with their leg. It requires timing and agility to execute properly and can be a game-changer in a match.b) Leg Whip: The leg whip is a technique that involves grabbing your opponent's leg and forcefully swinging it in a lateral or circular motion, destabilizing their balance and potentially taking them down to the mat. It requires a combination of strength and technique to generate enough momentum for an effective leg whip.
3. Leg Slap in Wrestling:
A leg slap is a term commonly used in professional wrestling. It refers to the act of a wrestler slapping their own thigh or leg during a strike or impact to create a loud sound effect, enhancing the perception of the move's impact. This technique is often employed to make moves appear more powerful and to engage the audience. It is important to note that leg slaps are primarily used in entertainment-based wrestling rather than traditional amateur wrestling.
4. Defending Leg Ride Wrestling:
While mastering leg wrestling moves can be advantageous, it's equally important to know how to defend against them. Here are a few tips for defending against leg ride wrestling:a) Maintain Base and Balance: To defend against leg rides, focus on keeping a solid base and maintaining your balance. A strong and stable position makes it harder for your opponent to gain control and execute leg wrestling moves effectively.b) Counter with Leg Defense Techniques: Familiarize yourself with counter techniques such as sprawls, leg whizzers, or knee slides. These moves can help you neutralize your opponent's leg ride attempts and regain control.c) Utilize Hand Fighting: Effective hand fighting can disrupt your opponent's leg wrestling moves. By controlling their hands and wrists, you limit their ability to secure leg rides and put you in vulnerable positions.Conclusion:Leg wrestling moves are valuable tools in a wrestler's arsenal. Understanding various leg ride techniques, leg drops, and the purpose of leg slaps can help you develop a well-rounded approach to wrestling. Remember, while mastering offensive moves is important, being adept at defending against legrides can provide you with a significant advantage on the mat. So, keep practicing, refining your techniques, and adapting your strategies to become a formidable force in the world of wrestling.

Mastering the Single Leg Takedown in Freestyle Wrestling
Are you looking to enhance your skills in freestyle wrestling and dominate your opponents with ease? Look no further! In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the art of mastering the single leg takedown. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your technique, this article will provide you with valuable insights, tips, and step-by-step instructions to help you excel in this essential move. Get ready to take your freestyle wrestling prowess to new heights and leave your competitors in awe.
The Basics of the Single Leg Takedown
The single leg takedown is a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling that can provide a significant advantage over your opponent. It involves taking control of one of your opponent’s legs and bringing them down to the ground while maintaining control. Mastering this technique requires a combination of proper footwork, positioning, gripping techniques, and a well-executed level change and penetration step.
Footwork and Positioning
Having correct footwork and positioning is crucial for a successful single leg takedown. To begin, establish a solid wrestling stance with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. This stance allows for better balance and agility, enabling you to react quickly to your opponent’s movements.
When going for a single leg takedown, step forward with your lead leg towards your opponent’s lead leg. Your lead leg should be outside of your opponent’s lead leg, creating an angle that provides a better opportunity to attack. Maintain a low center of gravity, keeping your head up and eyes focused on your opponent’s upper body.
Gripping Techniques
Proper gripping techniques are essential for gaining control of your opponent’s leg during a single leg takedown. There are various gripping options, but two common techniques are the high crotch grip and the ankle pick grip.
The high crotch grip involves reaching your same-side arm across your opponent’s body and securing a hold on their upper thigh, just below their hip. This grip allows for better control and leverage when executing the takedown.
The ankle pick grip, on the other hand, involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle with your same-side hand. This grip is effective when your opponent’s leg is extended or when they resist the high crotch grip.
Experiment with different gripping techniques and find the one that works best for you based on your opponent’s positioning and reactions.
Level Change and Penetration Step
Executing a proper level change and penetration step is the key to successfully completing a single leg takedown. A level change involves dropping your level by bending your knees and lowering your hips closer to the ground. This motion helps you avoid your opponent’s attacks and allows for a smoother transition into the takedown.
After the level change, perform a penetration step by driving your lead leg forward and shooting it towards your opponent’s leg. Simultaneously, reach for your desired grip on their leg, either high crotch or ankle pick. The penetration step should be explosive and quick, catching your opponent off guard and making it harder for them to defend.
Remember to maintain a strong grip, keep your head up, and drive through your opponent’s leg as you finish the takedown. Proper execution of the level change and penetration step, combined with precise footwork and effective gripping techniques, will greatly increase your chances of mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Common Variations of the Single Leg Takedown
High Crotch
The high crotch is a powerful and effective variation of the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg with your head positioned on the outside of their body. By grabbing their leg with both hands, you can drive forward and lift their leg off the ground, taking them down to the mat. The high crotch is known for its versatility, as it can be executed from various positions and angles. It requires good timing, speed, and technique to successfully execute the high crotch and secure the takedown.
Ankle Pick
Another common variation of the single leg takedown is the ankle pick. As the name suggests, this technique involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle and pulling it towards you, destabilizing their balance and setting up the takedown. The ankle pick is often executed when your opponent is in a defensive stance or when they are attempting to sprawl to defend against a regular single leg takedown. By quickly snatching their ankle and driving forward, you can bring them down to the mat and gain control.
Knee Tap
The knee tap is a variation of the single leg takedown that focuses on targeting your opponent’s knee for a swift takedown. This technique involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg, much like a regular single leg takedown, but instead of grabbing their leg, you aim to tap or push their knee with your hand. By applying pressure on their knee and redirecting their momentum, you can force them off balance and bring them down to the mat. The knee tap is particularly effective against opponents who have a strong base and are difficult to lift off the ground.
These variations of the single leg takedown provide wrestlers with a range of options to take down their opponents in freestyle wrestling. Each technique has its own advantages and requires practice to master. By incorporating these variations into your arsenal, you can become a more well-rounded wrestler with multiple takedown options at your disposal.
Defending Against the Single Leg Takedown
Sprawling
Sprawling is a crucial defensive technique when countering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves using your hips and legs to create distance and prevent your opponent from getting a hold of your leg. To perform a sprawl effectively, follow these steps:
Remember, practicing sprawls regularly is essential to develop the speed, timing, and technique required to defend against the single leg takedown effectively.
Whizzer and Overhook
Another effective method to defend against the single leg takedown is by utilizing the whizzer and overhook techniques. These techniques are especially useful when your opponent manages to secure a grip on your leg. Here’s how to execute the whizzer and overhook:
By mastering the whizzer and overhook techniques, you can effectively neutralize your opponent’s single leg takedown attempts and gain an advantage in the match.
Front Headlock
The front headlock is another valuable defensive technique that can be utilized to counter the single leg takedown. This technique involves controlling your opponent’s head and arm to prevent them from successfully executing the takedown. Here’s how to perform a front headlock:
Practicing the front headlock technique will not only enhance your defense against the single leg takedown but also open up various offensive possibilities.
Remember, mastering these defensive techniques takes time, practice, and repetition. By focusing on your sprawl, whizzer and overhook, and front headlock skills, you will significantly improve your ability to defend against the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Drills to Improve Single Leg Takedown
Shadow Drilling
Shadow drilling is a fundamental training technique that helps wrestlers perfect their single leg takedown. By visualizing an opponent and performing the movements without actual resistance, wrestlers can focus on their form and technique. Here are some key drills to incorporate into your shadow drilling routine:
Stance and Motion: Start by assuming the proper wrestling stance, with your lead leg forward and your weight distributed evenly. Practice moving in and out of your stance, circling, and level changing. This drill helps develop agility and quick footwork, which are crucial for executing a successful single leg takedown.
Penetration Step: The penetration step is the initial move in a single leg takedown. Practice driving off your back leg, stepping forward with your lead leg, and shooting your arm deep between your opponent’s legs. Focus on explosive power and maintaining a low center of gravity throughout the movement.
Finish Position: Once you have secured your opponent’s leg, it’s important to practice the proper finish position. Work on driving through your opponent, lifting their leg, and keeping your head up. Pay attention to your hand placement and grip, as they significantly impact your control over your opponent.
Partner Drills
Partner drills provide a dynamic training experience that simulates real-life wrestling scenarios. These drills help develop timing, coordination, and the ability to react to an opponent’s movements. Incorporate the following partner drills into your training regimen to enhance your single leg takedown skills:
Leg Defense Drill: Have your partner stand in a defensive position while you attempt single leg takedowns. Your partner’s goal is to sprawl and defend against your takedown attempts. Focus on properly executing your takedown technique while your partner tries to counter and defend. This drill improves your ability to read and react to your opponent’s movements.
Resistance Drill: Start in a neutral position with your partner. Initiate a single leg takedown while your partner provides resistance, forcing you to exert more effort to complete the takedown. This drill helps build strength and endurance while maintaining proper technique under pressure.
Counter Drill: In this drill, your partner attempts a single leg takedown while you work on countering their move. Practice sprawling, sprawling and turning, or executing a defensive technique like a whizzer. This drill improves your defensive skills and teaches you how to disrupt your opponent’s takedown attempts.
Live Situational Sparring
Live situational sparring involves engaging in controlled wrestling scenarios with a partner. It allows wrestlers to apply their single leg takedown skills in a realistic, dynamic setting. Here are some situational sparring scenarios to incorporate into your training:
Starting from Neutral: Begin the sparring session from a neutral position, with both you and your partner on your feet. Focus on initiating single leg takedown attempts while your partner defends and counters. This scenario simulates the unpredictability of a real wrestling match and helps sharpen your takedown skills under live conditions.
Starting from a Specific Position: Start the sparring session from various positions, such as starting with one wrestler already in on a single leg. This situation allows you to practice defending against an opponent in a dominant position and finding opportunities to counter and execute your own takedown.
Live Wrestling with Specific Objectives: Set specific objectives for the sparring session, such as scoring points with a single leg takedown or successfully defending against your partner’s takedown attempts. This type of situational sparring helps wrestlers focus on particular aspects of their single leg takedown game and improve their overall strategy.
By incorporating these drills and sparring scenarios into your training routine, you can enhance your single leg takedown skills and become a more formidable wrestler in freestyle wrestling. Practice diligently, stay focused, and never stop refining your technique.
In conclusion, mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling is a crucial skill that can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. By understanding the proper technique, positioning, and timing, wrestlers can effectively take down their opponents and gain an advantage in matches. The single leg takedown offers a versatile and reliable option for both offensive and defensive strategies, making it a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling. With consistent practice and dedication, wrestlers can develop their skills and become proficient in executing this technique. So, whether you are a beginner or an experienced wrestler, mastering the single leg takedown is an essential step towards achieving success in freestyle wrestling.

Ladder Drills: Agility ladder drills enhance footwork and coordination. Incorporate ladder exercises like the ""lateral shuffle"" and ""in-and-out"" drills.
Cone Drills: Set up a series of cones to practice sharp changes in direction, mimicking the unpredictability of wrestling movements.
Shadow Wrestling: Visualize and practice wrestling movements at high speed to improve muscle memory and quick reactions.
How to Get Faster in Wrestling
Consistent Practice: Regular, consistent training is essential. Incorporate speed-focused drills into your routine at least 2-3 times a week.
Strength Training: Building strength in your legs and core is the foundation of speed. Compound exercises like squats and deadlifts are crucial.
Proper Nutrition: Maintain a balanced diet to support muscle development and overall health, which can contribute to increased speed.
Rest and Recovery: Ensure you get adequate sleep and allow your muscles to recover to perform at your fastest.
How to Get Quicker for Wrestling
Agility Drills: Integrate agility-focused workouts into your training. Agility ladder drills and cone drills are excellent options.
Plyometrics: Add plyometric exercises to your routine to improve explosiveness and quickness.
Reaction Training: Partner drills that focus on quick reactions are invaluable for developing quickness.

When designing a wrestling strength and conditioning program, figuring out what the best exercises are to decrease the risk of injury and improve performance is critical. This is because we’re almost always limited by time.
For collegiate programs, the NCAA mandates how much time is allowed for training each week. But, even if there isn’t a time-limiting rule, we all have things in our life – school, work, family, etc that makes it hard to spend hours on end in the gym.
Figuring out the best exercises that absolutely should be in your wrestling strength program can help you maximize your time in the weight room and to make sure your efficiency matches your intensity.
So, which ten exercises do I think are the most important and why should you care? I’ve spent 20 years working as a sports performance coach and I’ve worked with multiple elite-level wrestlers. I may not know much, but I do know strength and conditioning.
Top Exercises for Wrestling
Power Clean
If I could only pick one exercise to train wrestlers it would be the Power Clean. Power Cleans are basically a total body movement that develops power, strength and coordination.
Want an explosive shoot? The explosive triple-extension of a Power Clean mimics a shoot more than any other movement in the weight room.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
My biggest coaching point for Power Cleans is to just say if you don’t feel comfortable with your technique, then I would refrain from doing them. Wait until you can be properly coached on how to do them correctly so you do not injure yourself.
In the meantime, here are 9 Power Clean alternatives you may be able to try out instead. Some of the alternate exercises I list there are much more beginner-friendly.
Back Squat
I would consider Back Squat the 1B to the Power Clean’s 1A. I think it falls behind the Power Clean, but not by much.
Having a strong lower body is critical to a wrestler’s success and no exercise is better equipped for building a strong lower body than Back Squats.
Yes, there are other effective forms of squatting (there is another on this list) and single-leg movements are very important too (there is one of those on this list as well). But, Back Squats should be one of the primary focal points of your training.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
There are two bar position options for Back Squat, low-bar and high-bar. I recommend and teach the high bar position when working with athletes, including wrestlers.
The most important aspect to watch for when doing Back Squats is the potential rounding of the back. Immediately end any set where form begins to break down and the back begins to round. A rounded back is probably the most common cause of injury with squatting.
One of the most common mistakes is heels coming off the ground. Athletes who are having trouble due to poor ankle dorsiflexion, long femur length relative to their height, or a combination of both, can use a device to elevate their feet such as weightlifting squat shoes, an angled plate, or 2.5lb weights to help address the issue.
Pull-ups
Pull-ups are my favorite upper body exercise for wrestlers.
For beginners, there are modifications that can be made while building the strength to be able to do Pull-ups. Doing Band-Assisted Pullups, Pull-up Holds and Eccentric Pull-ups are all variations that can be utilized until regular Pull-ups can be done.
Once you’ve mastered Pull-ups, it’s just as easy to modify Pull-ups to increase the challenge. Adding weight or controlling tempo are just two ways Pull-ups can be made as difficult as necessary.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instruction
Coaching Points
Take your time and master the pull-up. The benefits of doing sound pull-ups will pay dividends for your shoulder health and the potential to maximize your upper body strength.
By far the biggest mistake I see in the pull-up is lifters not using a full range of motion. Hang all the way down and maintain great tension through the shoulders and abdomen.
Pistol Squat
This was probably the exercise that I struggled with the most making a decision. Single leg work is a critical component of any wrestling strength training program. That’s not up for debate. However, I struggled with which single-leg exercise to pick.
I picked Pistol Squats for my single-leg movement for a few reasons.
First, Pistol Squats are literally done on one leg – no opposite leg to use for assistance whatsoever.
Second, I think you really have to be careful with how much posterior chain volume you place into any strength program. For instance, about half of the exercises on this very list are posterior chain movements. Too much posterior chain work can lead to tight low backs (or worse).
Pistol Squats allow athletes to focus on building true single-leg strength without added low back stress.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
If you cannot do a Pistol Squat the first time trying, don’t worry, you’re not alone. Most athletes I’ve worked with have to start by using a bench for pistol squats. The first thing you need to do to start progressing is figure out where your real weakness is: strength or flexibility.
Some lifters simply don’t possess the strength at first to perform a full pistol squat on air. On the other hand, many of the athletes I’ve coached actually have the strength to do a pistol squat, but they lack the mobility to be able to go through the full range of motion without falling or their opposite foot crashing into the ground.
Single Arm Dumbbell Bench Press
The reason is that SA DB Bench is an anti-rotational exercise. That means that as you bench, the core has to work to keep you from rotating and literally falling off the bench. This utilization of the core is so beneficial for wrestlers who need to be able to maintain core stability while pulling and pushing.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instruction
Coaching Points
If you’re familiar with Dumbbell Bench Press but are new to this single-arm variation, you’ll probably be pretty surprised by just how much you need to brace your core to keep from literally rotating off the bench. For this reason, start light and then work your way up in weight.
This is a very shoulder-friendly pressing movement. Because the implement is a dumbbell, the range of motion is increased, the shear force on the shoulder is decreased, and the shoulder stabilizing muscles are engaged.
Overhead Squat
I absolutely love Overhead Squats for athletes, especially wrestlers.
First, it is the ultimate mobility assessment tool because it demands mobility from almost every part of the body. If there are issues with the shoulders, back, hips or ankles they are going to show up when trying to Overhead Squat.
Second, if you want to see a wrestler that has tremendous shoulder stability, watch a wrestler who can Overhead Squat their bodyweight. It also, by the way, takes a great deal of core strength and stability to do that as well.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
If you find yourself struggling to keep the bar in the overhead position (it keeps falling forward), then you probably have a mobility issue in either the shoulders or thoracic (mid to upper back). Switch to a PVC Pipe until your mobility improves.
Single Arm Dumbbell Snatch
Another explosive exercise that I love for wrestlers is the Single Arm Dumbbell Snatch. It’s easy to learn, it’s unilateral (one side working at a time) and is a great Olympic lift variation to develop power. What’s not to love?
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The dumbbell should travel close to the body all the up until it gets about head height, then rotate the elbow, drop the hips and catch. Don’t allow it to swing forward out away from the body.
The second technique flaw is not staying braced through the return of the dumbbell to the starting position, oftentimes from being in too big of a hurry to knock out reps. Letting the dumbbell, especially the heavier you get, yank the shoulder down at the bottom of the rep is asking for trouble.
Trap Bar Deadlift
I like Trap Bar Deadlifts for wrestlers for a few reasons. First, they’re simply a great exercise for building lower body strength, especially for the posterior chain.
Being able to use a trap bar allows the weight to be shifted slightly more towards the hips which will take a bit of strain off the low back (compared to regular deadlifts).
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
Pro Tip: Don’t have a trap bar? Here are 10 alternatives for Trap Bar Deadlift that don’t need one.
Easily the most common mistake for deadlifts of any kind is allowing the back to round, placing unnecessary stress on the back. Keep the back flat throughout the movement and the core braced.
Do not bounce the bar off the floor between reps. Yes, bouncing the plates off the floor into the next rep may make the lift easier to do, but it’s also a good way to allow your technique to break down. Reset for each rep.
Battle Ropes
Upper-body muscular endurance is critical for wrestlers and nothing trains that better than Battle Ropes. Battle Rope Slams can train your upper body, core and conditioning – all wrapped up together.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
One of the keys to Battle Rope Slams is experimenting to find the optimal amount of slack to leave in the rope. You want enough slack that it doesn’t hinder the full range of motion, but not too much slack that it’s hard to develop a rhythm with the rope.
Make sure whatever you’re using as an anchor for the battle rope is secure. Battle rope movements generate a lot of power and momentum and can come loose easily if not secured in place.
Box Jumps
I couldn’t do an entire list of exercises for wrestlers and completely leave off plyometric training. The problem was which plyometric drill to pick.
I ended up going with probably the most popular and well-known plyometric training drill. Popular, but still extremely effective. Box Jumps.
Box Jumps will help develop explosiveness and take a lot of wear and tear off the joints by landing on a higher surface instead of all the way back to the ground each rep. Just focus on proper technique and avoid trying to jump on boxes too tall to do properly.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
Pick a box that is an appropriate height. You should land on the box in roughly a quarter-squat position. All too often I see athletes jump on a box that is way too high, causing them to have to land in a full squat position.
This is wrong for two reasons. First, picking your feet higher so you can land in a full squat doesn’t actually mean you jump any higher. Second, having to land in a full squat to make it onto the box eliminates any room for error. If you jump perhaps even an inch not high enough you could end up missing the box.
Final Thoughts
There is no shortage of quality exercises that you can utilize for wrestling workouts. However, in my opinion, those are the 10 most beneficial exercises that will help you increase your performance on the wrestling mat.

The cradle drill is a staple in the wrestling room to improve a wrestler's mobility on top and improve their reaction speed and agility to get in position upon an opening. The cradle drill can be performed precisely the same but with resistance attached to the top wrestler's legs.,"Wrestling Workouts and Drills
How explosive do you want to be? There are hundreds of  VertiMax wrestling workouts and drills to develop a quicker more explosive wrestler. VertiMax has revolutionized wrestling training. These drills can easily be done in a team training session by rotating your wrestlers in between sets.
VertiMax is the most influential wrestling training tool to hit the market in decades. It has completely revolutionized the way wrestlers can train and build power and strength while performing dynamic movements.  Where traditional sports and conditioning practices stop at building power and strength, VertiMax goes beyond this (but it does that too!) and allows athletes to increase their efficiency in specific movement patterns.  This means the improvements made in wrestling training using VertiMax are directly transferred into actual improvements in wrestling performance! VertiMax brings a whole new meaning to the specificity of training in wrestling.
Whether it’s a single-leg or double-leg takedown, wrestlers use this as a primary attack to bring their opponent to the mat.  The power and speed they perform shots dictate if a wrestler successfully completes the takedown. This makes it essential to train them with as much explosive power as possible.
VertiMax has changed the game for training shots as wrestlers can use loaded resistance training during actual shots for true functional adaptations.  Athletes can increase their power production while performing the same drills as they always have meaning a trainee is not just improving their leg power; they are improving their leg power in the way it’s used to shoot!
Check out Coalton showcasing how VertiMax can be used with shot drills!
A post shared by Christen Haywood (@train2reign11)
The only defense to an explosive shot is a powerful sprawl. What used to be limited to training with the only bodyweight can now utilize the innovative design of VertiMax to produce a defense move that is hard to catch. A successful sprawl depends on an initial explosive reaction of kicking your legs followed by powerful hip extension if needed to free your legs.
VertiMax can be used together with traditional sprawling drills that train sprawls to create a stimulus that demands more firing from the posterior muscles to drive the legs back. This also increases the reaction time and quickness of the movement.  Further, because of the unilateral training allowed by VertiMax wrestlers can train single leg or double leg sprawls.
A wrestler with a hard and fast sprawl is very difficult to take down.  You can create one training with VertiMax.
Standing up with explosive power is a skill by itself. Standing up with a guy on your back is twice as hard, but just another thing wrestlers need to do daily. Building explosive power strong enough to propel two people is necessary for two main performances in wrestling.
Standing up from this position requires very high levels of force and strength.  However, VertiMax delivers the perfect training stimulus on a wrestler by requiring more power with the cords to drive up .Because this tension is constantly pulling on the athlete, it further simulates an opponent who is continually trying to push you back down.
VertiMax can be used for wrestling drills to improve all these moves with the unique functional training only it can deliver.
Here is a great video showing how VertiMax can be used to create some insane lifting power!
Depending on the conference and competition level, a wrestling match usually consists of three rounds lasting two minutes a piece. This places a high priority on developing the anaerobic systems as these are responsible for providing energy during a match and the determinant moments of a match.
Wrestlers rely most heavily upon the glycolysis system during their matches as this is the primary metabolic system that supplies energy for events up to two minutes, precisely the length of a period. It has been suggested that these systems are responsible for providing 90% ATP during a wrestling match.
This means that when speaking strictly of being successful in an actual match, the anaerobic metabolic systems are more important to a wrestler than the aerobic system.
Improving the anaerobic conditioning has been made easy with VertiMax.  Using interval training or HIIT is highly effective to improve these systems and can be easily manipulated to mimic actual competition conditioning needs. However, wrestling conditions never occur free of resistance. There’s always an opponent grabbing, pulling, pushing, or trying to throw you. This is where VertiMax comes into play.
VertiMax’s unique system allows resistance to be applied to the waist, both arms, and both legs at the SAME TIME! This stimulates more realistic conditions as the wrestler must always be working against 5 points of resistance.
Work to rest intervals during an actual match are about 2:1 to 3:1, with the average work interval lasting around 30 seconds. Use VertiMax with interval training with these parameters for anaerobic conditioning specific to wrestling.

A post shared by Bulldog SNC (@bulldogstrongnj)
Further, VertiMax can also increase the muscular endurance of a wrestler as constant tension is placed on the arms and legs during training. This is vitally important as wrestlers need to use their limbs for the entire match, especially the upper body. Even when the wrestler is not actively grappling or holding their opponent, they always have their arms up to block their opponent, move their hands, or free their limbs. This must go on for the entire match.
This is why muscular endurance in the arms has specifically been identified as a determinant factor in wrestling success. Increasing neuromuscular efficiency of a muscle has a direct influence on it’s endurance making VertiMax the perfect tool for the job.
Through a combination of ballistic and plyometric exercises for wrestling (ball throws, ballistic push ups, and general strength building (pushups, chest press), VertiMax can build the muscle endurance a wrestler needs to make it the whole match.
VertiMax can give classic wrestling drills an immediate upgrade. The cradle drill is a staple in the wrestling room to improve a wrestler’s mobility on top and improve their reaction speed and agility to get in position upon an opening.
The cradle drill can be performed precisely the same but with resistance attached to the top wrestler’s legs. This will require higher muscle activity and force to be able to transition from side to side. The stimulus given will create a wrestler with a much higher level of agility and stamina when working their opponent.
Wrestlers need fast feet AND fast hands. Even when wrestlers aren’t engaged in actual grappling, they are ALWAYS moving for a variety of reasons:
Even some offensive moves like a “head snap” require fast and powerful hands. Wrestlers also need to be able to jump and dodge attacks. This requires extremely swift movements and reaction times.
Wrestlers can develop this quickness and speed to a much higher degree with the use of resistance provided by VertiMax.  Because natural movements are able to be loaded, wrestlers can build greater neural efficiency  in their movements. This results in a quicker, faster, and more powerful movements during a match.
VertiMax can also be easily integrated into plyometrics, and ballistic exercises for wrestlers. The tension that is applied to the wrestler from the multiple bands creates a greater demand on the muscles, enhancing the effectiveness of these exercises. Further, the wrestler’s hands and arms are free that allows them freedom of movement and offers a degree of safety that can’t be provided from other resistance training tools, such as rubber bands or holding weight.

Understanding the Ring and Its Components
Before diving into wrestling techniques, it's important to understand the ring and its components. The ring is a circular mat that measures 32 feet in diameter and is surrounded by a circle of foam padding. The center of the ring is marked by a small circle, which is used to start the match.
The mat itself is made of durable material that provides traction for wrestlers while also providing a soft landing surface. The foam padding that surrounds the ring is designed to protect wrestlers from injury if they are thrown out of the ring. It's important to note that the foam padding is not considered part of the ring, so wrestlers must stay within the boundaries of the mat in order to avoid being disqualified.
In addition to the ring and its components, there are several other key elements to wrestling, including rules and regulations, scoring, and weight classes. Understanding these elements is crucial for success in wrestling, regardless of your skill level.
Basic Wrestling Techniques - Stance and Footwork
The foundation of wrestling is proper stance and footwork. A good stance is essential for balance and control, while proper footwork is crucial for movement and agility. Here's a breakdown of the basic wrestling stance and footwork:
Stance: The basic wrestling stance involves standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and weight evenly distributed between both feet. Your head should be up, your back straight, and your hands should be held in front of you, ready to grapple.
Footwork: In wrestling, footwork is used to create angles and set up takedowns. The most common footwork techniques include the slide step, the crossover step, and the pivot step. The slide step involves stepping forward with one foot and then sliding the other foot forward to maintain your stance.

Takedowns are a key component of wrestling and involve taking your opponent down to the mat while maintaining control. There are several types of takedowns, including the single leg, double leg, and high crotch, among others. Here's a breakdown of each takedown:
Single Leg: The single leg takedown involves grabbing one of your opponent's legs and lifting it off the mat, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with one foot and reach down to grab your opponent's leg just above the ankle. Pull their leg towards you while pushing them off balance with your other hand, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.
Double Leg: The double leg takedown involves grabbing both of your opponent's legs and lifting them off the mat, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with both feet and reach down to grab both of your opponent's legs just above the ankles. Pull their legs towards you while pushing them off balance with your hands, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.
High Crotch: The high crotch takedown involves grabbing your opponent's leg and lifting it up to your side, while at the same time pushing them off balance. To execute this takedown, step forward with one foot and reach down to grab your opponent's leg just above the knee. Lift their leg up to your side, while at the same time pushing them off balance with your other hand, and then drive forward with your shoulder to take them down.

By mastering these escapes and reversals, you'll be able to get out of tough situations and regain control of the match.
Pinning Combinations - Cradle, Half-Nelson, and Tilt
Pinning combinations are techniques used to pin your opponent to the mat for a win. There are several types of pinning combinations, including the cradle, half-nelson, and tilt. Here's a breakdown of each combination:

Escape can be a crucial factor in deciding matches and can make the difference between winning and losing. It is important for a wrestler to have good technique when attempting to escape from the bottom position and be able to time it correctly in order to score the point.

How to Escape a Cradle in Wrestling?
To escape a cradle in wrestling, the wrestler must first turn their body away from the opponent. This will create space between them and make it easier to escape. The wrestler can then use their legs and arms to push off the opponent’s body, creating more space before standing up. This will help them escape the cradle and gain control of the match. The wrestler should also be aware of their opponent’s arms and make sure that they do not get caught in a submission hold.

You can practice by having someone hold you in a bad position, such as the bottom position, and then practicing escaping from it. You can also use objects, such as pillows and mats, to simulate the situation.

Practice these techniques diligently to improve your overall wrestling skills and increase your chances of success on the mat.
Pinning Techniques
Half Nelson
The half nelson is one of the most fundamental and effective pinning techniques in freestyle wrestling. It involves controlling your opponent’s upper body by using your arm and shoulder to apply pressure on their neck and shoulder. To execute the half nelson, follow these steps:
The half nelson is a versatile technique that can be used to set up other pinning moves or to control your opponent’s movements during a match. It requires proper technique and timing to execute effectively, so beginners should practice it extensively before using it in a competitive setting.
Cradle
The cradle is another effective pinning technique that involves immobilizing your opponent by securing both their arms and head. It is a great move to use when you have gained control of your opponent’s upper body. Follow these steps to execute the cradle:
The cradle is a highly effective move for securing a pin, as it restricts your opponent’s movement and makes it difficult for them to escape. It requires coordination and strength to execute properly, so beginners should focus on mastering the technique before using it in live matches.
Armbar
The armbar is a pinning technique that focuses on controlling and immobilizing your opponent’s arm. It can be used to set up a pin or to create opportunities for other offensive moves. Follow these steps to execute the armbar:
The armbar is a versatile move that can be used from various positions, such as when your opponent is on their back or when you are in a top position. It requires proper technique and control to execute effectively, so beginners should practice it under the guidance of a coach or experienced wrestler.
Defense Techniques
Sprawl
One of the most crucial defensive techniques in freestyle wrestling is the sprawl. The sprawl is a technique used to defend against an opponent’s takedown attempt. It involves dropping the hips and sprawling the legs backward when the opponent shoots in for a takedown.
By performing a sprawl, a wrestler can avoid getting taken down and maintain a dominant position on the mat. This defensive move requires good timing and quick reflexes to anticipate the opponent’s takedown attempt and react swiftly.
Front Headlock
Another effective defense technique in freestyle wrestling is the front headlock. This technique involves controlling the opponent’s head and neck from the front while standing or on the ground.
When an opponent initiates an attack, the wrestler can quickly secure a front headlock position by wrapping their arm around the opponent’s neck and grabbing their own wrist. From this position, the wrestler can exert control over the opponent’s movements and prevent them from executing their techniques effectively.
The front headlock can be used to counter an opponent’s takedown attempt or to set up various offensive moves such as throws or chokes. It requires good leverage and upper body strength to maintain control over the opponent while defending against their attacks.
Whizzer
The whizzer is another essential defensive technique that wrestlers utilize to counter an opponent’s takedown attempt. This move involves using a well-timed hip and arm movement to disrupt the opponent’s attack and regain control of the match.
When an opponent tries to execute a takedown, the wrestler can counter by sprawling one leg back while driving their hip into the opponent’s side. Simultaneously, they can wrap their arm around the opponent’s arm or waist, creating a whizzer position. This helps in neutralizing the opponent’s attack and turning the situation to their advantage.
The whizzer can be used to launch a counter-attack, escape from a precarious position, or gain control over the opponent’s movements. It requires a combination of agility, timing, and technique to execute effectively and prevent the opponent from scoring points.
Mastering these defense techniques – the sprawl, front headlock, and whizzer – is crucial for beginners in freestyle wrestling. By honing these skills, wrestlers can effectively defend against their opponents’ attacks, maintain control on the mat, and create opportunities for their own offensive moves.
In conclusion, mastering the essential freestyle wrestling techniques is crucial for beginners who want to excel in the sport. By understanding the fundamentals of stance, takedowns, escapes, reversals, and pinning combinations, wrestlers can build a strong foundation for their future success. These techniques not only enhance their skills but also improve their overall physical fitness, discipline, and mental toughness. With consistent practice and dedication, beginners can develop their wrestling abilities and progress to higher levels in the sport. So, grab your wrestling gear, find a coach, and start learning and implementing these essential techniques to become a formidable force on the mat. Happy wrestling!

Your elbow should be firmly planted on the pad, providing a strong base for your movements. Engage Your Fingers and Thumb: Begin by curling your fingers tightly around your opponent's hand. Your thumb plays a crucial role here, adding additional pressure.","How to Get Better at Arm Wrestling: Mastering Key Techniques
Discover essential techniques to improve your arm wrestling skills with our comprehensive guide. Learn about Rising, Cupping, Wrist Cupping, Pronation, Belt Grip, and Strength Training to dominate your arm wrestling matches. Perfect for beginners and seasoned competitors alike
Here’s a list of key techniques how to get better at arm wrestling.
Rising
The Rising technique in arm wrestling is a strategic move that focuses on lifting your opponent’s hand upwards to gain leverage. This technique is not just about physical strength; it’s about understanding the mechanics of leverage and using it to your advantage.
Rising works by targeting the weakest point in your opponent’s grip – typically the fingers or the wrist. By lifting their hand upwards, you disrupt their stable position, making it harder for them to apply force effectively. This move shifts the battle from sheer force to a more strategic manipulation of leverage.
The key to rising is in the wrist and fingers. The action involves a combination of wrist flexion and finger extension. By flexing your wrist upwards while extending your fingers, you create an upward force on your opponent’s grip. This movement requires strength in the forearm and flexibility in the wrist.
To effectively implement rising in a match:
To train for rising, focus on exercises that strengthen your wrists and forearms. Wrist curls, reverse wrist curls, and finger extensions are great exercises. Additionally, practicing the rising movement with a partner or using an arm wrestling table can help develop the specific muscles and techniques needed.
Cupping: Securing a Strong Grip
Cupping is a fundamental technique in arm wrestling that involves curling your hand towards your wrist. This move is essential for establishing and maintaining a strong, controlling grip on your opponent’s hand. Mastering cupping can significantly enhance your arm wrestling prowess by allowing you to dictate the flow of the match.
Cupping centers around the concept of reducing your opponent’s leverage while maximizing your own. By curling your fingers and thumb towards your wrist, you effectively ‘cup’ your hand, creating a concave shape. This action tightens your grip and limits your opponent’s ability to maneuver or escape.
To successfully implement cupping:
To train for this technique, focus on exercises that strengthen your forearm flexors and enhance your grip strength. Activities such as wrist curls, finger curls, and grip strength trainers are beneficial. Additionally, practicing the cupping motion during sparring sessions can help in developing muscle memory and technique refinement.
Wrist Cupping: A Twist on Traditional Cupping
Wrist cupping is an advanced arm wrestling technique that builds upon the basic cupping move by adding a twist to the wrist. This nuanced approach not only enhances grip strength but also introduces an element of control that can be pivotal in a match. Understanding and mastering wrist cupping can give arm wrestlers an edge, especially in challenging bouts.
The technique starts with the basic cupping motion – curling your hand towards your wrist. Once this grip is established, you then add a twisting motion. This rotation typically involves turning your wrist inwards, towards your body. This movement not only strengthens your grip but also disrupts your opponent’s alignment and leverage.
To effectively use wrist cupping in a match:
Developing proficiency in wrist cupping requires specific training focused on wrist flexibility and strength. Exercises like wrist curls with a twist, pronation and supination movements with weights, and grip strengthening exercises are particularly effective. Practice the combined cupping and twisting motion regularly to build muscle memory.
Wrist cupping offers a strategic advantage by providing a more secure grip and disrupting the opponent’s strategy. It can be particularly effective against opponents who rely heavily on their wrist strength or those who use techniques like top-rolling. Mastering wrist cupping can be a game-changer, especially in high-stakes matches where every little advantage counts.
Pronation: The Art of Twisting
Pronation in arm wrestling is a critical technique where you rotate your arm to make your palm face downwards. This movement is particularly effective for countering your opponent’s grip and can play a pivotal role in gaining the upper hand in a match. Mastering pronation can greatly enhance your arm wrestling abilities, providing a strategic advantage over opponents.
Pronation involves rotating the forearm so that the palm turns to face down. This move is crucial in arm wrestling as it can weaken your opponent’s grip and reduce their leverage. By pronating your arm, you apply a twisting force that can disrupt your opponent’s position and strategy, making it difficult for them to maintain a strong hold.
To successfully use pronation in a match:
Pronation in arm wrestling is a critical technique where you rotate your arm to make your palm face downwards. This movement is particularly effective for countering your opponent’s grip and can play a pivotal role in gaining the upper hand in a match. Mastering pronation can greatly enhance your arm wrestling abilities, providing a strategic advantage over opponents.
Pronation offers a strategic edge in arm wrestling by allowing you to counter various grip techniques and styles. It’s especially useful against opponents who rely on techniques like the top roll or hook. Effective pronation can shift the dynamics of a match, giving you the leverage to overpower your opponent.
Belt Grip
The Belt Grip is a lesser-known but highly effective technique in arm wrestling that involves utilizing your belt or waistband to gain additional stability and leverage during a match. This technique is particularly useful in situations where maintaining endurance and a steady position is crucial. Understanding and correctly implementing the Belt Grip can provide a significant advantage in arm wrestling competitions.
The Belt Grip technique is based on the principle of using your own body and clothing as leverage points. By gripping your belt or waistband with your non-wrestling hand, you create a point of stability that helps you anchor your body more effectively. This technique allows for better control over your movements and can help resist the force exerted by your opponent.
In arm wrestling, balance and stability are as important as strength. The Belt Grip aids in maintaining a balanced posture by providing an additional anchor point. By holding onto your belt or waistband, you can prevent your body from being easily moved or twisted by your opponent’s actions, thereby maintaining a more advantageous position.
To effectively use the Belt Grip:
While the Belt Grip doesn’t require specific physical training, it does require practice to master. Incorporating this technique into your practice sessions will help you get accustomed to the feel and benefits it offers. Focus on maintaining the grip throughout various movements and techniques to understand how it affects your overall performance.
The main advantage of the Belt Grip is the added stability and leverage it provides. This can be especially beneficial in lengthy matches where endurance plays a crucial role. It also offers a psychological edge, as maintaining a steady and controlled posture can be intimidating to opponents.
Strength
In the world of arm wrestling, strength training is more than just a routine; it’s a crucial component for achieving success. While techniques and strategies are vital, the role of physical strength, particularly in the forearms, biceps, and shoulders, cannot be overstated. A well-rounded strength training program can significantly enhance your arm wrestling capabilities.
Arm wrestling demands a unique combination of strength, endurance, and power. It’s a sport that tests the limits of your arm’s muscular capabilities. Strengthening the muscles in your forearm, biceps, and shoulders not only improves your ability to exert force but also enhances your resistance against your opponent’s moves.
Recovery is as crucial as the workout itself. Ensure you have adequate rest days and consider incorporating recovery techniques like stretching, massage, or foam rolling. Proper nutrition and hydration are also vital for muscle repair and growth.
Conclusion
Improving at arm wrestling requires a mix of technique, strategy, and physical strength. By mastering techniques like Rising, Cupping, Wrist Cupping, Pronation, and the Belt Grip, and by enhancing your overall strength, you can significantly improve your performance in this challenging sport. Remember, consistent practice, dedication, and learning from each match are key to becoming a formidable arm wrestler.

A strong core is essential for wrestling, and honestly, for any athlete of any sport. A strong core helps transfer power, aids in balance and provides stability. All are important qualities to almost every movement on the wrestling mat, so developing a strong core should be a massive priority for every wrestler.
In this article, I’m going to give you my 10 favorite core exercises for wrestling to help maximize your performance on the mat.
This article contains affiliate links. If you make a purchase using these links I may earn a commission. Thanks.
Core Exercises For Wrestling
I’m going to list all 10 exercises from the most beginner-friendly up to the most advanced. So, whether you’re a complete beginner or an elite-level wrestler, you should be able to find a few exercises to challenge you and help you improve.
Toe Touches
I’m not going to list crunches, because I think we’re all too familiar with those. Instead, I’m going to give you another simple body weight core exercise that is one of my favorites – Toe Touches. Like crunches, Toes Touches are easy to learn and simple to do.
Having to hold your legs vertically in the air forces the lower abs to be engaged making them slightly harder than regular crunches.
But, the reason I really like Toe Touches for wrestlers is it gives insight into hamstring flexibility. Athletes with really tight hamstrings will struggle to get into a proper position and will struggle even more to maintain it.
If this sounds familiar then it’s time to start addressing those hammys.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
Athletes with tight hamstrings may find it hard to keep their legs straight up in the air through the duration of the exercise. Work to keep legs straight and vertical as much as possible.
Keep hands relatively close to the shins throughout the movement. Swinging the arms toward the head at the bottom causes momentum which takes away from the quality of the movement.
Planks
There are so many reasons that I love programming Planks for athletes, especially wrestlers.
First, it teaches and reinforces what it means to brace your core. Knowing how to properly, and effectively, brace your core is so important not only in the weight room but on the mat as well.
Second, holding a plank can sometimes be as mentally challenging as it is physically challenging. I think anytime you can introduce situations (safely!) that get athletes out of their comfort zone and force them to strain is beneficial.
Finally, planks are extremely versatile. You can add weight or time to make them more challenging. You can switch to a side plank to incorporate more obliques and they also work great as a competition to finish a workout.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The biggest mistake that I see with Front Planks is athletes holding the position, but not properly keeping the core engaged and just allowing the torso to slouch. So, while they are technically up on their elbows and toes, all they’re really doing is straining the low back.
The other mistake I see is the exact opposite and that is athletes shooting their butts into the air, resembling more of a Down Dog position.
The difference between the two is the second, having your butt too high, is easier to notice and corrected more often. However, letting the body slouch during a plank is often allowed to pass as ‘good form’ when it is not.
Half Kneeling Cable Chop
The Half Kneeling Cable Chop is easily one of my favorite core exercises for wrestlers because I believe they have an excellent transfer to the mat.
Cable Chops force you to brace your core while moving a weight diagonally across the body. Being able to brace and stabilize against external forces (like your opponent) is critical in wrestling.
Equipment Needed
Muscles Worked
How To
Coaching Points
*This movement is best done with either the rope attachment with the rope slid all the way over to one side or a straight bar attachment with the cable attached to one side.
Keep the torso upright during the movement. If you find yourself (or your athletes) leaning to one side or the other it’s probably an indication that the weight is too heavy. Lighten the weight being used and focus on maintaining that upright position.
Do not rotate through the torso. The goal here is to maintain a braced core and upright body position as you pull the weight across your body.
Seated Med Ball Twist
Seated Med Ball Twists are a staple in my wrestling programming. It’s a simple exercise, but the movement – bracing and rotating – is incredibly transferrable to the mat.
If you want a slightly more advanced version, have a partner stand a few feet to your side and throw the ball back and forth to them.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points (Common Mistakes)
The biggest mistake I see with my athletes when doing Seated Med Ball Twists is moving the ball back and forth primarily with their arms instead of rotating through the core. The focus should be on the rotation. The ball touching the ground is simply an added bonus to the movement.
Speaking of the ball touching the ground – there is no need to bang the ball off the ground as hard as possible for each rep. Stay in control of the movement and the med ball and lightly tap it on the ground.
Med Ball Side Slam
The next few exercises I’m going to suggest all utilize a medicine ball. A medicine ball is an extremely useful tool for developing power, including core power.
The first medicine ball movement is the Med Ball Side Slam. I love this exercise for wrestlers because it involves bracing, rotation and generating power all in one movement.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
First and foremost, test how ‘bouncy’ your medicine ball is before starting. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen athletes almost have their faces smashed by a medicine ball bouncing much harder and rebounding much faster off the ground than they were anticipating.
The biggest mistake I see with Med Ball Side Slams is athletes not utilizing the core and simply throwing the ball down with their arms. The bulk of the force should be generated by aggressively using the core to hinge forward. If done correctly, it should almost (and actually might) lift your feet up off the floor.
Med Ball Side Toss
Med Ball Side Toss is a rotational core exercise utilizing a medicine ball that is fantastic for developing rotational power.
I love Med Ball throwing movements with wrestlers like Slams and Side Tosses because of how dynamic they are and how much power they are able to generate. Definitely beats lying on the ground and doing crunches every day.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The biggest mistake I see athletes make is using their arms (and not their hips) way too much to throw the ball. Power for the throw should primarily come from rotating the hips and torso and the arms should be secondary.
*If you have a partner, you can throw to each other instead of into a wall.
**The distance away from the wall will vary depending on what type of medicine ball you have. If you have a hard rubber medicine ball then be prepared for the ball to bounce a good way back off of the wall. If you have a soft Dynamax-type medicine ball then you can stand much closer as the bounce off the wall will be much less.
Stir The Pot
Stir the Pot is a sneaky hard core exercise that challenges your ability to stay braced and stabilized as your arms shift around on a stability ball.
I love this exercise for wrestlers because being able to stay braced and stabile as your opponent is constantly shifting and changing their position is so critical in wrestling.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
Take your time getting properly set up! If you’ve never done this exercise before it can be surprising just how hard it is to balance yourself on a stability ball in this manner let alone shift in circles.
Make SMALL circles. Trying to go too big with your circles is a good way to end up lying on your back.
Hyperextensions
Too often when players think about doing ‘core work’ they only think of working their abs. However, low back work is just as important, but it’s often either overlooked or just ignored.
Hyperextensions are one of the best movements you can do in a weight room to focus on building a strong low back. Hypers will also work the glutes and hamstrings as well.
If you don’t have access to a Glute Ham Machine, you can try either Supermans or Back Crunches. Both also work the low back and require no equipment.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instruction
Coaching Points
Hyperextensions are surprisingly easy to mess up. One of the easiest ways to make a mistake is going down too fast and “whipping” yourself back to the starting position. As with any exercise, the setup, initial breath before eccentric movement, maintaining control, pausing, and breathing out during concentric contraction are important.
It is important for the lifter to maintain a neutral spine, maintaining tension in the abdomen and upper back. Remember to breathe in and hold the breath during eccentric (lowering your body) and breathe out as you perform the concentric movement (bringing your body back up).
Hanging Straight Leg Raises
Hanging ab exercises like Hanging Straight Leg Raises are some of my absolute favorite core exercises.
Not only are they very challenging ab movements, but they also provide extra benefits as well. They’re a great way to sneak grip strength into your workout and many also work the shoulders, back and biceps as well.
Equipment Needed
Muscles Worked
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The biggest issue that most of my athletes run into when doing Hanging Straight Leg Raises (or any hanging ab exercise for that matter) is how to keep from swinging out of control.
To keep from swinging, you have to actively lower your legs back down. If you ‘let your legs go’ and just allow gravity to take over you’ll completely lose control of the movement. Timing and rhythm are also both important for Leg Raises and you can’t achieve either if you’re not in control of your legs throughout the movement.
Windshield Wipers
By far the hardest core exercise listed here are Windshield Wipers. It is the ultimate in core strength and stabilization. And, not only do they require tremendous ab strength, but they also demand a strong grip and back as well.
If you’ve reached the point where you can rep out Windshield Wipers, you should feel really good about your core strength. (If you want a slightly easier version, try Floor Windshield Wipers)
Equipment Needed
Muscles Worked
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
As mentioned at the top of this guide, this is an extremely challenging ab exercise. I would highly suggest mastering other hanging ab exercises like Hanging Leg Raises before beginning to attempt Windshield Wipers.
Because you’re almost hanging upside down while doing Windshield Wipers, the grip plays an extremely critical role. If you ever feel you’re struggling with your grip AT ALL, you should stop your set immediately.
Final Thoughts
Are these the only 10 core exercises that I like to use with wrestlers? Absolutely not. There are dozens of core exercises to choose from so there is no need to get in a rut of doing the same movements over and over again all the time.
You also don’t have to limit yourself to just bodyweight abs, like crunches and sit-ups, either. Grab a medicine ball or find a pull-up bar and add some variety (and difficulty) to your core routine.
Finally, don’t forget about that posterior chain! Exercises like Hyperextensions, Supermans or even Back Crunches can help strengthen your low back – an important part of your core.

Lay your free hand on your stomach. Placing your hand on your hip (as shown in the featured image above) will help balance you more is a more beginner-friendly hand placement. Keep your feet flat on the floor.","10 Best Exercises for Wrestling To Maximize Performance
When designing a wrestling strength and conditioning program, figuring out what the best exercises are to decrease the risk of injury and improve performance is critical. This is because we’re almost always limited by time.
For collegiate programs, the NCAA mandates how much time is allowed for training each week. But, even if there isn’t a time-limiting rule, we all have things in our life – school, work, family, etc that makes it hard to spend hours on end in the gym.
Figuring out the best exercises that absolutely should be in your wrestling strength program can help you maximize your time in the weight room and to make sure your efficiency matches your intensity.
So, which ten exercises do I think are the most important and why should you care? I’ve spent 20 years working as a sports performance coach and I’ve worked with multiple elite-level wrestlers. I may not know much, but I do know strength and conditioning.
Top Exercises for Wrestling
Power Clean
If I could only pick one exercise to train wrestlers it would be the Power Clean. Power Cleans are basically a total body movement that develops power, strength and coordination.
Want an explosive shoot? The explosive triple-extension of a Power Clean mimics a shoot more than any other movement in the weight room.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
My biggest coaching point for Power Cleans is to just say if you don’t feel comfortable with your technique, then I would refrain from doing them. Wait until you can be properly coached on how to do them correctly so you do not injure yourself.
In the meantime, here are 9 Power Clean alternatives you may be able to try out instead. Some of the alternate exercises I list there are much more beginner-friendly.
Back Squat
I would consider Back Squat the 1B to the Power Clean’s 1A. I think it falls behind the Power Clean, but not by much.
Having a strong lower body is critical to a wrestler’s success and no exercise is better equipped for building a strong lower body than Back Squats.
Yes, there are other effective forms of squatting (there is another on this list) and single-leg movements are very important too (there is one of those on this list as well). But, Back Squats should be one of the primary focal points of your training.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
There are two bar position options for Back Squat, low-bar and high-bar. I recommend and teach the high bar position when working with athletes, including wrestlers.
The most important aspect to watch for when doing Back Squats is the potential rounding of the back. Immediately end any set where form begins to break down and the back begins to round. A rounded back is probably the most common cause of injury with squatting.
One of the most common mistakes is heels coming off the ground. Athletes who are having trouble due to poor ankle dorsiflexion, long femur length relative to their height, or a combination of both, can use a device to elevate their feet such as weightlifting squat shoes, an angled plate, or 2.5lb weights to help address the issue.
Pull-ups
Pull-ups are my favorite upper body exercise for wrestlers.
For beginners, there are modifications that can be made while building the strength to be able to do Pull-ups. Doing Band-Assisted Pullups, Pull-up Holds and Eccentric Pull-ups are all variations that can be utilized until regular Pull-ups can be done.
Once you’ve mastered Pull-ups, it’s just as easy to modify Pull-ups to increase the challenge. Adding weight or controlling tempo are just two ways Pull-ups can be made as difficult as necessary.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instruction
Coaching Points
Take your time and master the pull-up. The benefits of doing sound pull-ups will pay dividends for your shoulder health and the potential to maximize your upper body strength.
By far the biggest mistake I see in the pull-up is lifters not using a full range of motion. Hang all the way down and maintain great tension through the shoulders and abdomen.
Pistol Squat
This was probably the exercise that I struggled with the most making a decision. Single leg work is a critical component of any wrestling strength training program. That’s not up for debate. However, I struggled with which single-leg exercise to pick.
I picked Pistol Squats for my single-leg movement for a few reasons.
First, Pistol Squats are literally done on one leg – no opposite leg to use for assistance whatsoever.
Second, I think you really have to be careful with how much posterior chain volume you place into any strength program. For instance, about half of the exercises on this very list are posterior chain movements. Too much posterior chain work can lead to tight low backs (or worse).
Pistol Squats allow athletes to focus on building true single-leg strength without added low back stress.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
If you cannot do a Pistol Squat the first time trying, don’t worry, you’re not alone. Most athletes I’ve worked with have to start by using a bench for pistol squats. The first thing you need to do to start progressing is figure out where your real weakness is: strength or flexibility.
Some lifters simply don’t possess the strength at first to perform a full pistol squat on air. On the other hand, many of the athletes I’ve coached actually have the strength to do a pistol squat, but they lack the mobility to be able to go through the full range of motion without falling or their opposite foot crashing into the ground.
Single Arm Dumbbell Bench Press
The reason is that SA DB Bench is an anti-rotational exercise. That means that as you bench, the core has to work to keep you from rotating and literally falling off the bench. This utilization of the core is so beneficial for wrestlers who need to be able to maintain core stability while pulling and pushing.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instruction
Coaching Points
If you’re familiar with Dumbbell Bench Press but are new to this single-arm variation, you’ll probably be pretty surprised by just how much you need to brace your core to keep from literally rotating off the bench. For this reason, start light and then work your way up in weight.
This is a very shoulder-friendly pressing movement. Because the implement is a dumbbell, the range of motion is increased, the shear force on the shoulder is decreased, and the shoulder stabilizing muscles are engaged.
Overhead Squat
I absolutely love Overhead Squats for athletes, especially wrestlers.
First, it is the ultimate mobility assessment tool because it demands mobility from almost every part of the body. If there are issues with the shoulders, back, hips or ankles they are going to show up when trying to Overhead Squat.
Second, if you want to see a wrestler that has tremendous shoulder stability, watch a wrestler who can Overhead Squat their bodyweight. It also, by the way, takes a great deal of core strength and stability to do that as well.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
If you find yourself struggling to keep the bar in the overhead position (it keeps falling forward), then you probably have a mobility issue in either the shoulders or thoracic (mid to upper back). Switch to a PVC Pipe until your mobility improves.
Single Arm Dumbbell Snatch
Another explosive exercise that I love for wrestlers is the Single Arm Dumbbell Snatch. It’s easy to learn, it’s unilateral (one side working at a time) and is a great Olympic lift variation to develop power. What’s not to love?
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The dumbbell should travel close to the body all the up until it gets about head height, then rotate the elbow, drop the hips and catch. Don’t allow it to swing forward out away from the body.
The second technique flaw is not staying braced through the return of the dumbbell to the starting position, oftentimes from being in too big of a hurry to knock out reps. Letting the dumbbell, especially the heavier you get, yank the shoulder down at the bottom of the rep is asking for trouble.
Trap Bar Deadlift
I like Trap Bar Deadlifts for wrestlers for a few reasons. First, they’re simply a great exercise for building lower body strength, especially for the posterior chain.
Being able to use a trap bar allows the weight to be shifted slightly more towards the hips which will take a bit of strain off the low back (compared to regular deadlifts).
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
Pro Tip: Don’t have a trap bar? Here are 10 alternatives for Trap Bar Deadlift that don’t need one.
Easily the most common mistake for deadlifts of any kind is allowing the back to round, placing unnecessary stress on the back. Keep the back flat throughout the movement and the core braced.
Do not bounce the bar off the floor between reps. Yes, bouncing the plates off the floor into the next rep may make the lift easier to do, but it’s also a good way to allow your technique to break down. Reset for each rep.
Battle Ropes
Upper-body muscular endurance is critical for wrestlers and nothing trains that better than Battle Ropes. Battle Rope Slams can train your upper body, core and conditioning – all wrapped up together.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
One of the keys to Battle Rope Slams is experimenting to find the optimal amount of slack to leave in the rope. You want enough slack that it doesn’t hinder the full range of motion, but not too much slack that it’s hard to develop a rhythm with the rope.
Make sure whatever you’re using as an anchor for the battle rope is secure. Battle rope movements generate a lot of power and momentum and can come loose easily if not secured in place.
Box Jumps
I couldn’t do an entire list of exercises for wrestlers and completely leave off plyometric training. The problem was which plyometric drill to pick.
I ended up going with probably the most popular and well-known plyometric training drill. Popular, but still extremely effective. Box Jumps.
Box Jumps will help develop explosiveness and take a lot of wear and tear off the joints by landing on a higher surface instead of all the way back to the ground each rep. Just focus on proper technique and avoid trying to jump on boxes too tall to do properly.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
Pick a box that is an appropriate height. You should land on the box in roughly a quarter-squat position. All too often I see athletes jump on a box that is way too high, causing them to have to land in a full squat position.
This is wrong for two reasons. First, picking your feet higher so you can land in a full squat doesn’t actually mean you jump any higher. Second, having to land in a full squat to make it onto the box eliminates any room for error. If you jump perhaps even an inch not high enough you could end up missing the box.
Final Thoughts
There is no shortage of quality exercises that you can utilize for wrestling workouts. However, in my opinion, those are the 10 most beneficial exercises that will help you increase your performance on the wrestling mat.

Keep your feet flat on the floor.","10 Best Exercises for Wrestling To Maximize Performance
When designing a wrestling strength and conditioning program, figuring out what the best exercises are to decrease the risk of injury and improve performance is critical. This is because we’re almost always limited by time.
For collegiate programs, the NCAA mandates how much time is allowed for training each week. But, even if there isn’t a time-limiting rule, we all have things in our life – school, work, family, etc that makes it hard to spend hours on end in the gym.
Figuring out the best exercises that absolutely should be in your wrestling strength program can help you maximize your time in the weight room and to make sure your efficiency matches your intensity.
So, which ten exercises do I think are the most important and why should you care? I’ve spent 20 years working as a sports performance coach and I’ve worked with multiple elite-level wrestlers. I may not know much, but I do know strength and conditioning.
Top Exercises for Wrestling
Power Clean
If I could only pick one exercise to train wrestlers it would be the Power Clean. Power Cleans are basically a total body movement that develops power, strength and coordination.
Want an explosive shoot? The explosive triple-extension of a Power Clean mimics a shoot more than any other movement in the weight room.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
My biggest coaching point for Power Cleans is to just say if you don’t feel comfortable with your technique, then I would refrain from doing them. Wait until you can be properly coached on how to do them correctly so you do not injure yourself.
In the meantime, here are 9 Power Clean alternatives you may be able to try out instead. Some of the alternate exercises I list there are much more beginner-friendly.
Back Squat
I would consider Back Squat the 1B to the Power Clean’s 1A. I think it falls behind the Power Clean, but not by much.
Having a strong lower body is critical to a wrestler’s success and no exercise is better equipped for building a strong lower body than Back Squats.
Yes, there are other effective forms of squatting (there is another on this list) and single-leg movements are very important too (there is one of those on this list as well). But, Back Squats should be one of the primary focal points of your training.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
There are two bar position options for Back Squat, low-bar and high-bar. I recommend and teach the high bar position when working with athletes, including wrestlers.
The most important aspect to watch for when doing Back Squats is the potential rounding of the back. Immediately end any set where form begins to break down and the back begins to round. A rounded back is probably the most common cause of injury with squatting.
One of the most common mistakes is heels coming off the ground. Athletes who are having trouble due to poor ankle dorsiflexion, long femur length relative to their height, or a combination of both, can use a device to elevate their feet such as weightlifting squat shoes, an angled plate, or 2.5lb weights to help address the issue.
Pull-ups
Pull-ups are my favorite upper body exercise for wrestlers.
For beginners, there are modifications that can be made while building the strength to be able to do Pull-ups. Doing Band-Assisted Pullups, Pull-up Holds and Eccentric Pull-ups are all variations that can be utilized until regular Pull-ups can be done.
Once you’ve mastered Pull-ups, it’s just as easy to modify Pull-ups to increase the challenge. Adding weight or controlling tempo are just two ways Pull-ups can be made as difficult as necessary.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instruction
Coaching Points
Take your time and master the pull-up. The benefits of doing sound pull-ups will pay dividends for your shoulder health and the potential to maximize your upper body strength.
By far the biggest mistake I see in the pull-up is lifters not using a full range of motion. Hang all the way down and maintain great tension through the shoulders and abdomen.
Pistol Squat
This was probably the exercise that I struggled with the most making a decision. Single leg work is a critical component of any wrestling strength training program. That’s not up for debate. However, I struggled with which single-leg exercise to pick.
I picked Pistol Squats for my single-leg movement for a few reasons.
First, Pistol Squats are literally done on one leg – no opposite leg to use for assistance whatsoever.
Second, I think you really have to be careful with how much posterior chain volume you place into any strength program. For instance, about half of the exercises on this very list are posterior chain movements. Too much posterior chain work can lead to tight low backs (or worse).
Pistol Squats allow athletes to focus on building true single-leg strength without added low back stress.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
If you cannot do a Pistol Squat the first time trying, don’t worry, you’re not alone. Most athletes I’ve worked with have to start by using a bench for pistol squats. The first thing you need to do to start progressing is figure out where your real weakness is: strength or flexibility.
Some lifters simply don’t possess the strength at first to perform a full pistol squat on air. On the other hand, many of the athletes I’ve coached actually have the strength to do a pistol squat, but they lack the mobility to be able to go through the full range of motion without falling or their opposite foot crashing into the ground.
Single Arm Dumbbell Bench Press
The reason is that SA DB Bench is an anti-rotational exercise. That means that as you bench, the core has to work to keep you from rotating and literally falling off the bench. This utilization of the core is so beneficial for wrestlers who need to be able to maintain core stability while pulling and pushing.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instruction
Coaching Points
If you’re familiar with Dumbbell Bench Press but are new to this single-arm variation, you’ll probably be pretty surprised by just how much you need to brace your core to keep from literally rotating off the bench. For this reason, start light and then work your way up in weight.
This is a very shoulder-friendly pressing movement. Because the implement is a dumbbell, the range of motion is increased, the shear force on the shoulder is decreased, and the shoulder stabilizing muscles are engaged.
Overhead Squat
I absolutely love Overhead Squats for athletes, especially wrestlers.
First, it is the ultimate mobility assessment tool because it demands mobility from almost every part of the body. If there are issues with the shoulders, back, hips or ankles they are going to show up when trying to Overhead Squat.

Wrestling is a demanding sport that requires a combination of strength, speed, and endurance. To excel on the mat, wrestlers need to focus on developing their muscular strength and endurance. In this article, we will discuss some of the most effective wrestling exercises for building strength.
Squats: Squats are a great exercise for building lower body strength, which is essential for wrestlers. They target the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, as well as the core and lower back. To perform a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and lower your body as if you were going to sit back into a chair. Push through your heels to return to the starting position. Aim to perform 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.
Deadlifts: Deadlifts are another great exercise for building lower body strength. They target the same muscles as squats, but also work the upper back and shoulders. To perform a deadlift, stand with your feet hip-width apart, bend at your hips, and grab the barbell with an overhand grip. Keep your back straight and lift the barbell off the ground by straightening your legs. Aim to perform 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.
Pull-ups: Pull-ups are a great exercise for building upper body strength, specifically targeting the back, shoulders, and biceps. To perform a pull-up, grab a pull-up bar with an overhand grip, and pull your body up towards the bar. Lower yourself slowly and repeat. Aim to perform 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.
Dips: Dips are a great exercise for building upper body strength, specifically targeting the chest, triceps, and shoulders. To perform a dip, grab the parallel bars and lower yourself down by bending your arms. Push back up to the starting position. Aim to perform 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.
Clean and Jerk: The Clean and Jerk is a full-body exercise that builds power and explosiveness. It targets the legs, hips, back, shoulders, and arms. To perform the Clean and Jerk, start by lifting the barbell from the ground to your shoulders (the clean), then explosively press it overhead (the jerk). Aim to perform 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.
In addition to these exercises, wrestlers should also incorporate cardio and flexibility training into their workout routines. Cardio exercises such as running, cycling, or swimming can help improve endurance, while stretching and yoga can improve flexibility and prevent injuries.
It's important to note that Wrestling has a specific demands on the body and injury prevention should be a priority. It is always recommended to consult with a coach or trainer before starting any new workout routine.
In conclusion, these are just a few examples of the many exercises that can help wrestlers build strength and improve their performance on the mat. Incorporating these exercises into a regular workout routine, along with cardio and flexibility training, can help wrestlers take their game to the next level.

Wrestling likely benefits the most from physicality compared to other forms of martial arts. In fact, an old study concluded that physiological variables (such as strength) are the best way to predict success in elite-level wrestlers [1].
Maximal dynamic and isometric strength are strong predictors of wrestling performance. Elite-level wrestlers possess greater strength than their sub-elite counterparts across all weight classes.
To gain the most accurate understanding of how important strength training is for wrestling, we must compare elite and non-elite wrestlers' strength and power capabilities. If elite wrestlers are stronger in certain areas, we can confidently conclude that they are important for high-level wrestling performance.

Wrestler Strength Training Benefits
Strength training is an essential component of preparing for wrestling, a sport that demands technical skill and a high degree of physical strength, power, speed, and endurance. Here’s why you should strength train for wrestling.
Strength Training Reduces Injury Risk
There is a host of evidence supporting that stronger athletes are more resistant to injury. For example, one meta-analysis found strength training reduces sports injuries to less than a third and reduces overuse injuries by 50% [17].
Further, a 10% increase in strength training volume reduces the risk of injury by more than 4% [18]. Safe to say, hitting the gym can keep you on the mats longer.
Be Able To Train Harder
While being stronger will keep you on the mats longer without injury, it also makes you a more robust wrestler. Stronger wrestlers can handle workloads with less risk of injury and tolerate larger week-to-week changes in training load [19].
A spike in training load is often associated with injury. Meaning if you go from little training to suddenly hours of intense training, being stronger will make you more resilient and able to bounce back faster.
Strength Exercises Increase Strength & Power
Wrestling is a sport of strength and power. Strength is a strong predictor of wrestling performance [1].
5 Step Blueprint To Build A BJJ Strength Workout To Demolish Your Opposition
Learn how to plan your strength training to maximize transfer to the mats.
A well-programmed strength training routine (like in our 12-week off-season wrestling strength & conditioning program) will enhance strength and power without making you slow or “muscle bound.”
Since power is the product of force and velocity, lifting weights targets the force side of the power equation.
Lifting Weights Can Make You A Faster Wrestler
Speed kills in all sports. Wrestling included. Strength is one of the backbones of speed and, when performed correctly, enhances speed alongside strength. If you want to blast double legs easily, get in the gym.
Develop Specific Wrestling Strength
Weight training is typically general preparation for wrestling. However, you can perform exercises closer to representing wrestling movements.
One example is sandbag bearhug carries, which mimics the postures and muscles worked when lifting an opponent.
Another option is the Zercher squat, forcing you to support the weight with your arms and shoulders and maintain an upright posture.
Gain A Mental Edge
Knowing you have the strength to lift hefty poundages and having muscles to show for it is a confidence booster. Having this mindset going into a match can make or break your competition's success.
While exercise isn’t the ideal way to develop mental toughness, having this confidence may give you the extra push during a competitive wrestling match.
Best Strength Exercises For Wrestling
Squat
The squat is considered the king of lower body exercises. It targets the glutes and quads but is limited by your back strength. You have many variations to play with, such as back squats, front squats, and even zercher squats.
What you use depends on your injury history, stage of training, and what you feel most comfortable performing. I’m a big fan of the front squat, and here is how to do it:
Deadlift
The deadlift is another lower body dominant staple exercise within wrestling workouts. It targets the glutes, hamstrings, quads, and back. You’ll also strengthen your grip, which is a bonus. I’m not a huge fan of programming it because heavy deadlifts are hard to recover from, making it tough to wrestle later.
Further, many wrestlers suffer from lower back pain, and deadlifting can make this worse. However, some wrestlers love the deadlift exercise and, when programmed properly, can be a great addition to your workout.
However, I recommend choosing the trap bar over the barbell variation as it reduces lower back stress, and the elevated handles reduce the range of motion. Here’s how to do it:
Power Clean
I’m a big proponent of Olympic Weightlifting movements for wrestlers. It doesn’t need to be the classical snatch and clean & jerk. Weightlifting derivatives are easier to learn and maximize strength and power development without mastering the technique.
Moving heavy loads quickly is the name of the game for maximizing the transfer between resistance exercise and wrestling training. Here’s how to do it:
Jump Squat
Jumping is an excellent alternative to the Weightlifting movements. It has no learning curve, and you can express power with varying loads. You can use a barbell on your back or hold a trap bar or dumbbell by your side.
Jumping improves your ability to produce force quickly, which is a key requisite for wrestling performance. Here’s how to do it:
Snatch High Pull
The snatch high pull is my go-to weight training exercise for building a powerful upper back. You must sequence the pull from the floor, then use your hips and upper back muscles to propel the barbell toward your chest.
It’s the ultimate full-body strength exercise for wrestlers and closely mimics the mat return movement like the power clean. Here’s how to do it:
Weighted Pull-Up
Pull-ups should be a staple within your wrestling workouts. For variation, they can be done with an underhand (chin-up) or overhand (pull-up) grip. You can level them up further by using towels to strengthen your grip. Here’s how to do it:
Barbell Row
The barbell row is an epic strength exercise as it puts you in a bent-over position where you must support your body weight and the barbell. Honestly, I hate doing this exercise. But the exercises you hate give you the most significant gains.
If you don’t want to use the barbell, the dumbbell row is a great substitute when done heavy. Here’s how to barbell row:
Push Press
The push press is another Weightlifting derivative that must be in a wrestler's weight training program. You must sequence the force generated from your legs to your hands and arms like many takedowns. Here’s how to do it:
Sandbag Loading
Sandbag loading is the more specific version of the Weightlifting derivatives regarding wrestling training. Within the power clean, the hips and knees aren’t thrust forward as that kicks the bar horizontally. But this is ideal when loading a sandbag.
It gets you into a similar position to performing a mat return and carrying your opponent on your hips. The awkward sandbag makes it even better. Here’s how to do it:
Sandbag Bearhug Carry
Like sandbag loading, the bearhug carry is a brutal Strongman exercise challenging your entire body from your hips to your hands. You can make incredible endurance improvements with this exercise when done consistently. Here’s how to do it:
Farmers Walk
Of course, no wrestling exercise list is complete without the farmers walk. It taxes the grip and upper back like no other exercise. Farmers' handles are typically best, but kettlebells also make a good option. Here’s how to do it:
Strength Profile Of Elite vs. Non-Elite Wrestlers
Maximal dynamic and isometric strength has been well-researched within the wrestling community. Rightly so, wrestling requires picking up and moving other humans of similar size. Maximal strength in wrestling exceeds values seen in the striking arts but is comparable to other grappling arts, such as judo
[2]. Highlighting the different physical requirements needed for these martial arts.
126 male wrestlers were categorized as top elite, elite, and amateur wrestlers [3]. The top elite won medals at European and/or World Championships. Elite wrestlers participated in these events but didn’t win a medal, and amateurs did not compete.
The researchers found no differences between levels regarding isometric grip strength, back strength, or leg strength, regardless of weight class. However, lower body average and peak power during maximal cycling sprint tests were greater in elite than amateurs.
These differences were not seen between the top elite and the elite, indicating that once a certain level of physical ability is reached, the technical and tactical ability separates the very top wrestlers.
It's important to note that amateurs in this study had less training experience than elite wrestlers, potentially explaining the reduced physical capacity.
But we can’t draw conclusions from one study!
Let's examine a case study involving the Iranian 4x World senior Greco-Roman wrestling champion in the 55 kg weight class [4]. This wrestler completed 30% more pull-ups and 8% more sit-ups than the National norms, highlighting his enhanced muscular endurance qualities.
He was also stronger in the back squat compared to National norms relative to body weight (1.83 vs. 1.79 respectively). However, his bench press was lower at 1.39 vs. 1.48 relative to bodyweight.
Similar strength levels were found in elite Iranian Junior wrestlers in the 55 kg weight class, with an average of 1.9 and 1.4 squat and bench press relative to body weight [5].
In fact, strength relative to body weight was not too different between weight classes, with a general trend of relative strength decreasing as weight classes increased due to the increase in the absolute load of the exercise.
If we compare these numbers to Division III American College wrestlers, the elite Iranian Junior wrestlers showed higher squat and bench press numbers, which potentially indicates that higher-level wrestlers are stronger [6].
Furthermore, research on elite Junior Turkish wrestlers compared strength measurements between those selected for the National Team for the World Championships and those not [7].
While they didn’t measure the traditional dynamic lifts such as the squat and bench press, they measured isometric grip, back, and leg strength.
Selected wrestlers were found to have 10% greater grip strength, 12% greater isometric back strength, and 7% greater isometric leg strength compared to those who weren’t selected for the National training camp.
Looking again at senior wrestlers, a 2015 study compared elite and sub-elite wrestlers where elite wrestlers were those with 8+ years of experience and participated in at least three International events representing their country, while sub-elite wrestlers were finalists in their National competitions but never competed internationally [8].
Elite wrestlers had higher bench presses (1.1 vs. 0.9) and squats (1.4 vs. 1.1) relative to bodyweight than sub-elite wrestlers.
Adding to this body of evidence is a 2011 study that set out to find which physical factors predict wrestling performance by comparing elite and amateur wrestlers by bodyweight (lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight) [9]. Elite wrestlers had more fat-free mass and 12-26% greater squat and bench press than amateurs.
Maximum muscle power was also much higher for these exercises, ranging from 14-30% greater than seen in amateur wrestlers. It seemed that age and physical training experience wasn’t the distinguishing factor regarding muscle strength and power, but rather fat-free mass.
The load that maximized power in the squat was approximately 60-65% 1RM, and the bench press was approximately 34-37% 1RM regardless of weight class, providing some essential, actionable information to inform strength programming.
Elite wrestlers also showed stronger grip strength in the light and middleweight classes, ranging from 6-19% greater, but no differences were seen in heavyweights. Maximal back strength was also much higher in elites than amateurs at 7-20%.
Overall, we can conclude that dynamic and isometric physical strength is important to wrestling success and should be prioritized within a wrestler's training program.
Physical Differences Between Greco-Roman and Freestyle Wrestling
Both Freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling are Olympic sports. Freestyle wrestling is characterized by the use of explosive techniques over a 2 x 3-minute bout. The main distinction is the ability to use upper and lower body wrestling while Greco-Roman only allows upper body techniques
[10]. Do these differences influence the physical profiles of elite wrestlers?
Junior Greco-Roman and Freestyle wrestlers of the Polish National team were compared through a range of physical tests [11]. Freestyle wrestlers showed greater strength endurance of the trunk (sit-ups and side twists) and the upper body (pull-ups and dips).
This may be explained by the number of techniques that can be used to end a match by either using the arms or legs such as various leg locks making it attack-oriented wrestling.
Freestyle wrestlers also possessed stronger bench presses, snatches, and higher vertical jumps than Greco-Roman wrestlers.
A more recent study on junior Turkish wrestlers found slightly different results where no differences were found in strength (grip and back) between wrestling styles except for isometric leg strength being higher in Greco-Roman wrestlers [10].
Perhaps the differences found in these studies could come down to the testing modalities used with the former using dynamic strength endurance tests where the latter used isometric tests. As both wrestling styles require high-levels of isometric strength, perhaps these values won’t differ to the same extent as dynamic movement when freestyle wrestling is considered a more explosive style.
How Wrestling Tournaments Affect Strength
Understanding how a wrestling tournament may impact strength as matches’ progress may provide some valuable insight into strength training preparation. So one study followed Division I freestyle wrestlers who were National and International competitors over a 2-day simulated tournament after a weight cut [12].
Day 1 had 3, 5 minutes matches while Day 2 had 2 matches. As we know, there can be some differences between sparring and competitive matches so to make the environment more competitive, wrestlers were competing for a starting position within their weight class.
Both handgrip and bear hug strength declined from the first match compared to baseline over the 2 days. Vertical jump only declined at the start of Day 2 likely due to the increased concentrations of the muscle damage marker creatine kinase.
Further, reductions in slower velocity and isometric elbow and knee strength were observed throughout the tournament showing slower, maximal strength movements to be more susceptible to fatigue compared to faster velocity movements.
It may be pertinent to emphasize isometric, maximal strength, and strength endurance over higher-velocity strength training due to the high levels of fatigue present in tournaments as well as strength being a major predictor of wrestling success.
Injury Profile Of Wrestling
Starting at the American high school level, the most commonly injured areas were the shoulder (24%) and knee (17%) [13]. Shoulder injuries were mainly rotator cuff muscle strains and knee injuries mainly contusions and meniscus tears. Ankles were the most common joint sprain.
Another study investigating high school and collegiate wrestling found half of the injuries were strains and sprains [14]. Knee (25% & 15%) and shoulder (18% & 18%) injuries were the most common in collegiate and high school wrestlers respectively.
When looking at the Olympic level, the 2008 Beijing Olympics showed freestyle wrestling had the highest injury rates
[15]. Most injuries were cuts (60%) and sprains (25%) with the upper body having more injuries than the lower body.
The 2016 Rio Olympics showed similar findings with the most common injury being cuts and contusions (55%) but with both freestyle and Greco-Roman sustaining high injury rates (36% & 41% respectively) [16].
We can conclude that strengthening the shoulder, knee, and ankles should remain a strong focus throughout a strength training plan for wrestling.
Wrestling Strength Training Program
While there are potentially small differences between freestyle and Greco-Roman, this will be an example of wrestling workouts. Strength training for wrestlers is more than a basic Powerlifting routine.
There are other attributes that must be addressed within the program.
I’ve set this up in two phases, as I've done with the other strength training programs on Sweet Science of Fighting. Phase 1 will focus on developing maximal dynamic strength and sub-maximal isometric strength.
Phase 2 will continue to focus on maximal dynamic strength and maximal isometric strength. However, with some more advanced set/rep protocols. One is using cluster sets to maintain high-quality volume and potentially minimize some of the fatigue from the sets.
Reducing some of the fatigue is essential as a high volume power training (HVPT) approach is taken with the jump squat and bench throw made popular by Alex Natera.
HVPT improves maximal jump performance and the ability to repeat power, which is potentially beneficial for the explosive nature of freestyle wrestling.
I broke down this training protocol in my video below:
This program will focus on a 3-day-a-week model as strength training is more important to wrestling than other martial arts. They may train 3-4 times a week for their sport at least at the collegiate level and even less if it is the off-season. This program will have an off-season focus.

Workouts for Wrestlers
Wrestlers need a well-rounded training program that covers a spectrum of physical attributes. This includes strength, endurance, flexibility, and agility. Here are some fundamental components of a wrestler's workout routine:
Strength Training: Wrestlers require excellent functional strength. Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and overhead presses are integral to build the necessary power. Bodyweight exercises such as pull-ups, push-ups, and dips help enhance overall strength.
Agility and Balance: Wrestlers should incorporate drills that improve agility and balance, such as ladder drills, cone drills, and plyometric exercises like box jumps.
Flexibility and Mobility: A good wrestling workout should include stretching and mobility exercises to prevent injuries and maintain flexibility. Yoga and dynamic stretching can be beneficial in this regard.
Skill Work: Wrestling is a technical sport, and wrestlers need to practice specific moves and techniques. This includes takedowns, escapes, pins, and holds.
Strength Training for Wrestling
Strength is a cornerstone of success in wrestling. To develop the strength necessary for the sport, wrestlers should focus on the following:
Compound Lifts: Exercises like squats, deadlifts, and power cleans are crucial for building full-body strength.
Bodyweight Exercises: Push-ups, pull-ups, and dips help develop functional strength and are easily accessible for training.
Core Work: A strong core is essential for balance and power. Incorporate exercises like planks, Russian twists, and leg raises into your routine.
Resistance Bands: These can be useful for developing specific muscle groups and improving overall strength.
Wrestling Team Workouts
Team workouts are essential for creating camaraderie, teamwork, and competition within the group. These can include partner drills, technique sessions, and live wrestling sessions where teammates grapple against each other.
Wrestling Workout Routine
A sample weekly wrestling workout routine might look like this:
Best Wrestling Exercises
Here are some of the most effective wrestling-specific exercises:
Cardio for Wrestling
Wrestlers need to maintain a high level of cardiovascular fitness. Cardio workouts can include running, swimming, cycling, and intense interval training. These exercises build endurance and help you maintain high energy levels during matches.
College Wrestling Workouts
College-level wrestling demands even greater dedication and intensity in training. Student-athletes often have access to advanced facilities and coaching staff. Workouts are tailored to individual needs, focusing on refining technique, enhancing strength, and improving mental resilience.
How Do Wrestlers Train?
Wrestlers train tirelessly to hone their physical and mental attributes. They work on their technique, strength, endurance, and mental toughness through a combination of drills, exercises, and sparring sessions. They often follow periodization training, adjusting their workouts throughout the season to peak at the right time for competitions. Nutrition, rest, and recovery are equally important components of their training regimen.

Core Exercises For Wrestling
I’m going to list all 10 exercises from the most beginner-friendly up to the most advanced. So, whether you’re a complete beginner or an elite-level wrestler, you should be able to find a few exercises to challenge you and help you improve.
Toe Touches
I’m not going to list crunches, because I think we’re all too familiar with those. Instead, I’m going to give you another simple body weight core exercise that is one of my favorites – Toe Touches. Like crunches, Toes Touches are easy to learn and simple to do.
Having to hold your legs vertically in the air forces the lower abs to be engaged making them slightly harder than regular crunches.
But, the reason I really like Toe Touches for wrestlers is it gives insight into hamstring flexibility. Athletes with really tight hamstrings will struggle to get into a proper position and will struggle even more to maintain it.
If this sounds familiar then it’s time to start addressing those hammys.
Equipment Needed
How To
Coaching Points
Athletes with tight hamstrings may find it hard to keep their legs straight up in the air through the duration of the exercise. Work to keep legs straight and vertical as much as possible.
Keep hands relatively close to the shins throughout the movement. Swinging the arms toward the head at the bottom causes momentum which takes away from the quality of the movement.
Planks
There are so many reasons that I love programming Planks for athletes, especially wrestlers.
First, it teaches and reinforces what it means to brace your core. Knowing how to properly, and effectively, brace your core is so important not only in the weight room but on the mat as well.
Second, holding a plank can sometimes be as mentally challenging as it is physically challenging. I think anytime you can introduce situations (safely!) that get athletes out of their comfort zone and force them to strain is beneficial.
Finally, planks are extremely versatile. You can add weight or time to make them more challenging. You can switch to a side plank to incorporate more obliques and they also work great as a competition to finish a workout.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The biggest mistake that I see with Front Planks is athletes holding the position, but not properly keeping the core engaged and just allowing the torso to slouch. So, while they are technically up on their elbows and toes, all they’re really doing is straining the low back.
The other mistake I see is the exact opposite and that is athletes shooting their butts into the air, resembling more of a Down Dog position.
The difference between the two is the second, having your butt too high, is easier to notice and corrected more often. However, letting the body slouch during a plank is often allowed to pass as ‘good form’ when it is not.
Half Kneeling Cable Chop
The Half Kneeling Cable Chop is easily one of my favorite core exercises for wrestlers because I believe they have an excellent transfer to the mat.
Cable Chops force you to brace your core while moving a weight diagonally across the body. Being able to brace and stabilize against external forces (like your opponent) is critical in wrestling.
Equipment Needed
Muscles Worked
How To
Coaching Points
*This movement is best done with either the rope attachment with the rope slid all the way over to one side or a straight bar attachment with the cable attached to one side.
Keep the torso upright during the movement. If you find yourself (or your athletes) leaning to one side or the other it’s probably an indication that the weight is too heavy. Lighten the weight being used and focus on maintaining that upright position.
Do not rotate through the torso. The goal here is to maintain a braced core and upright body position as you pull the weight across your body.
Seated Med Ball Twist
Seated Med Ball Twists are a staple in my wrestling programming. It’s a simple exercise, but the movement – bracing and rotating – is incredibly transferrable to the mat.
If you want a slightly more advanced version, have a partner stand a few feet to your side and throw the ball back and forth to them.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points (Common Mistakes)
The biggest mistake I see with my athletes when doing Seated Med Ball Twists is moving the ball back and forth primarily with their arms instead of rotating through the core. The focus should be on the rotation. The ball touching the ground is simply an added bonus to the movement.
Speaking of the ball touching the ground – there is no need to bang the ball off the ground as hard as possible for each rep. Stay in control of the movement and the med ball and lightly tap it on the ground.
Med Ball Side Slam
The next few exercises I’m going to suggest all utilize a medicine ball. A medicine ball is an extremely useful tool for developing power, including core power.
The first medicine ball movement is the Med Ball Side Slam. I love this exercise for wrestlers because it involves bracing, rotation and generating power all in one movement.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
First and foremost, test how ‘bouncy’ your medicine ball is before starting. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen athletes almost have their faces smashed by a medicine ball bouncing much harder and rebounding much faster off the ground than they were anticipating.
The biggest mistake I see with Med Ball Side Slams is athletes not utilizing the core and simply throwing the ball down with their arms. The bulk of the force should be generated by aggressively using the core to hinge forward. If done correctly, it should almost (and actually might) lift your feet up off the floor.
Med Ball Side Toss
Med Ball Side Toss is a rotational core exercise utilizing a medicine ball that is fantastic for developing rotational power.
I love Med Ball throwing movements with wrestlers like Slams and Side Tosses because of how dynamic they are and how much power they are able to generate. Definitely beats lying on the ground and doing crunches every day.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The biggest mistake I see athletes make is using their arms (and not their hips) way too much to throw the ball. Power for the throw should primarily come from rotating the hips and torso and the arms should be secondary.
*If you have a partner, you can throw to each other instead of into a wall.
**The distance away from the wall will vary depending on what type of medicine ball you have. If you have a hard rubber medicine ball then be prepared for the ball to bounce a good way back off of the wall. If you have a soft Dynamax-type medicine ball then you can stand much closer as the bounce off the wall will be much less.
Stir The Pot
Stir the Pot is a sneaky hard core exercise that challenges your ability to stay braced and stabilized as your arms shift around on a stability ball.
I love this exercise for wrestlers because being able to stay braced and stabile as your opponent is constantly shifting and changing their position is so critical in wrestling.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
Take your time getting properly set up! If you’ve never done this exercise before it can be surprising just how hard it is to balance yourself on a stability ball in this manner let alone shift in circles.
Make SMALL circles. Trying to go too big with your circles is a good way to end up lying on your back.
Hyperextensions
Too often when players think about doing ‘core work’ they only think of working their abs. However, low back work is just as important, but it’s often either overlooked or just ignored.
Hyperextensions are one of the best movements you can do in a weight room to focus on building a strong low back. Hypers will also work the glutes and hamstrings as well.
If you don’t have access to a Glute Ham Machine, you can try either Supermans or Back Crunches. Both also work the low back and require no equipment.
Equipment Needed
Step-by-Step Instruction
Coaching Points
Hyperextensions are surprisingly easy to mess up. One of the easiest ways to make a mistake is going down too fast and “whipping” yourself back to the starting position. As with any exercise, the setup, initial breath before eccentric movement, maintaining control, pausing, and breathing out during concentric contraction are important.
It is important for the lifter to maintain a neutral spine, maintaining tension in the abdomen and upper back. Remember to breathe in and hold the breath during eccentric (lowering your body) and breathe out as you perform the concentric movement (bringing your body back up).
Hanging Straight Leg Raises
Hanging ab exercises like Hanging Straight Leg Raises are some of my absolute favorite core exercises.
Not only are they very challenging ab movements, but they also provide extra benefits as well. They’re a great way to sneak grip strength into your workout and many also work the shoulders, back and biceps as well.
Equipment Needed
Muscles Worked
Step-by-Step Instructions
Coaching Points
The biggest issue that most of my athletes run into when doing Hanging Straight Leg Raises (or any hanging ab exercise for that matter) is how to keep from swinging out of control.
To keep from swinging, you have to actively lower your legs back down. If you ‘let your legs go’ and just allow gravity to take over you’ll completely lose control of the movement. Timing and rhythm are also both important for Leg Raises and you can’t achieve either if you’re not in control of your legs throughout the movement.
Windshield Wipers
By far the hardest core exercise listed here are Windshield Wipers. It is the ultimate in core strength and stabilization. And, not only do they require tremendous ab strength, but they also demand a strong grip and back as well.
If you’ve reached the point where you can rep out Windshield Wipers, you should feel really good about your core strength. (If you want a slightly easier version, try Floor Windshield Wipers)

As mentioned at the top of this guide, this is an extremely challenging ab exercise. I would highly suggest mastering other hanging ab exercises like Hanging Leg Raises before beginning to attempt Windshield Wipers.
Because you’re almost hanging upside down while doing Windshield Wipers, the grip plays an extremely critical role. If you ever feel you’re struggling with your grip AT ALL, you should stop your set immediately.
Final Thoughts
Are these the only 10 core exercises that I like to use with wrestlers? Absolutely not. There are dozens of core exercises to choose from so there is no need to get in a rut of doing the same movements over and over again all the time.
You also don’t have to limit yourself to just bodyweight abs, like crunches and sit-ups, either. Grab a medicine ball or find a pull-up bar and add some variety (and difficulty) to your core routine.
Finally, don’t forget about that posterior chain! Exercises like Hyperextensions, Supermans or even Back Crunches can help strengthen your low back – an important part of your core.

The granby series is an extremely effective arsenal from the bottom position. Knowing how to defend it is imperative when wrestling a team that is well trained with it. Knowing how to perform a Granby roll and what to expect from a Granby wrestler while adding these key elements to your top game, can put the squash on the Granby series!
How do you roll a Granby?
Step 1 of Granby Roll:
Chop
When wrestling a Granby series opponent, an easy fix off the whistle is to switch to the opposite side off the whistle. When chopping your opponents arm, it’s not a good idea to fall to your hip. When chopping keep your back knee in his rear. so it will be harder for them to perform the Granby series.
Step 2 of Granby Roll: Attack an ankle
Another one is switching sides and attacking an ankle to prevent a good Granby series start from your opponent.
Step 3 of Granby Roll: Spiral ride and half nelson
A spirial ride and half nelson ride is also very effective in stopping the Grandy series. From the referees position, as you step your lead foot up, place your belly button hand inside your oponent’s thigh and your elbow hand extends their arm above the elbow. Be sure to get high on your opponent’s base to keep the weight forward and use your head to drive their head down. Keep driving the opponent down, with a combination of lifting their arm and driving their head down, as you drive your half nelson in and look for the far wrist. Once you get the half nelson, the series starts.
Step 4 of Granby Roll: Ankle ride
Another great way to stop the Granby series is to switch sides and apply an ankle ride. Off the whistle, switch sides on your opponent and bump them forward. When their rear is off their ankles, hook their ankle with your inside leg. This will prevent your opponent from executing the Granby series.
Step 5 of Granby Roll: Don’t grab around the waist
A key tactic to always be aware of when wrestling a Granby wrestler is to stay away from reaching around their waist from the opposite side. Be extra aware when going behind your opponent on takedowns. Be sure to grab your opponent’s hip or ankle instead.
In conclusion, the Granby series can cause quite the problems if you’re not prepared. Master these tactics and you’ll eliminate your opponents ability to escape, or even worse, put you to your back!

The gut wrench is a powerful technique used in wrestling to gain control over an opponent from the top position. Here's how to execute the gut wrench:1. Secure the position: Start by gaining control over your opponent's upper body, wrapping your arms tightly around their waist.2. Apply pressure: With a firm grip, drive your shoulder into your opponent's midsection, initiating a twisting motion while maintaining control over their waist.3. Create leverage: Utilize your leg and hip movement to generate rotational force, effectively wrenching your opponent's midsection and destabilizing their base.4. Maintain control: Continue applying pressure and adjusting your grip as needed to prevent your opponent from escaping or countering.

Impact: Unleash the splash, landing with precision on your opponent's chest or abdomen, using your momentum to maximize the impact.
Technical Falls in Wrestling:
A technical fall is an alternative way to secure victory in a wrestling match. It occurs when a wrestler accumulates a significant lead, typically by outscoring their opponent by a predetermined margin. In most cases, a technical fall results in an immediate victory, showcasing the superior performance and skill of the winning wrestler.
Snapdowns for Strategic Advantage:
Snapdowns are effective techniques used to control an opponent's posture, create openings, and set up scoring opportunities. Here's how to execute a snapdown:1.Hand fighting: Engage in hand-to-hand combat with your opponent, striving to control their wrists and arms.2. Seize the opportunity: When your opponent's posture becomes vulnerable, snap their head down forcefully by pulling their neck or forehead downward. This action disrupts their balance and control.3. Capitalize on the opening: As your opponent's head drops, quickly transition into a favorable position, such as attacking their legs, executing a takedown, or maneuvering for back control.4. Maintain momentum: Stay aggressive after the snapdown, relentlessly pursuing additional scoring opportunities while exploiting the advantage gained from disrupting your opponent's balance.
The Abdominal Stretch Wrestling Move:
The abdominal stretch is a highly effective wrestling maneuver used to immobilize opponents and inflict pain. Here's how to execute the abdominal stretch:1.

Twist and stretch: Pull your opponent toward you while applying pressure to their midsection. Lean back, using your grip and leverage to generate tension and pain in their abdomen and lower back.3. Maintain control: Use your leg hook to restrict your opponent's movement, making it difficult for them to escape or counterattack.4. Endgame: Continue exerting pressure on your opponent's midsection while assessing opportunities to transition into another move or secure a pinfall.
Conclusion:
Defending against the armbar and mastering a range of wrestling techniques are vital for success on the mat. By understanding the intricacies of defending against the armbar, implementing the gut wrench, executing the frog splash, recognizing technical falls, utilizing snapdowns, and applying the abdominal stretch, you'll have a well-rounded arsenal to dominate your opponents.

Shot Re-Shot Drill. The first drill on the list is a shot/re-shot drill. If you are not familiar with this, you can do it both offensively or defensively. To drill it offensively, grab a partner and have them block your first shot attempt.","8 Drills To Take Your Wrestling To The Next Level
To get better at wrestling, you need to be doing drills. There are so many different wrestling drills a person can and often times people fall into a pattern of doing the same drills over and over, but this may not be the best use of you time in practice. Plus, if you are only doing the same drills, you may hit a point where you feel like you aren’t really improving. Here are eight drills to help you take your wrestling to the next level.
Shot Re-Shot Drill
The first drill on the list is a shot/re-shot drill. If you are not familiar with this, you can do it both offensively or defensively. To drill it offensively, grab a partner and have them block your first shot attempt. Then, while your level is still low take another shot. You can change the type of shots you are looking for each time too. You may start with a double leg, then re-shoot with an outside sweep single. You can even have your partner change up how many shots they block so it may take you two or up to five shots before you get in on a leg.
To do this drill defensively, have your partner take a shot and this time you block them. Once you block their shot, as soon as the start to raise their level to come back up into a stance, you take a shot on them. Using the motion of your opponent’s shots as a setup is a great way to score takedowns. If you want to see this in action, check out some of Jordan Burroughs’ matches. He utilizes re-shots better than anyone in the world.
Cradle Drill
The next drill you can add is a cradle drill. You can start with your partner sitting with their knees bent, like they just hit a sitout from the bottom. Then practice going from one side to the other and each time locking up either a near side cradle or a farside cradle. When you feel that you have that down, you can have your partner move around on bottom and look to lock up cradles from the different positions they move to. This drill will help you to notice how many opportunities there are in a match to lock up cradles and there are a lot, but if you haven’t trained yourself to see them in the moment, when the opportunity presents itself, you will miss it.
Shot Transition Drill
Being able to smoothly transition from single legs to doubles and vice versa is an important skill in wrestling. To do this drill, get in on either a single leg or a double leg. Then, work on driving into your partner while they use their hips to pressure back into you. While you are driving them back, be sure to keep your head up and you hips under you; don’t try to finish the shot.
If you start with a single leg, your head should be on the inside. Your partner will push your head from the inside position to the outside. When they do, transition to a double leg. Begin moving and driving them around in a double leg until they push your head back to the inside, then transition back to single leg. You can keep going back and forth. This drill will help you to stay in good position when you are in on a shot.
Takedown To Pin
Every wrestler practices takedowns and pins, but a great drill to do is hit a takedown and immediately put your partner on their back and look for the pin. You could drill single legs to a half to a pin. Or you could hit a double leg straight into a turk. The combinations of takedowns to pins are endless. By doing this drill, it will train you to automatically look to turn your opponent when you hit a takedown in a match. Check out this video by Olympic gold medalist Henry Cejudo where he teaches a double leg directly into a turk finish.
Hand Control Drill
Another great drill to incorporate into your training is a hand control from the bottom drill. This is something that wrestlers at every level needs to work on. If you go to any wrestling meet, you will hear coaches yelling at their wrestler to get hand control when they are on the bottom. To do this drill, start out flat on your belly and have your partner get on top and get wrist control. From here, roll your wrists out and establish hand control on both sides. Then, work off your belly all the way to an escape on your feet. Be sure to keep hand control the whole time. As you feel more comfortable with this, have your partner give you some resistance and have them try to break your hand control while you work to escape. If you want to get good escaping from the bottom position, you have to learn to control your opponent’s hands.

Clearing Ties
One drill that can really help you out on your feet is clearing ties. To do this drill, get in a stance in front of a partner and have them reach up and try to lock up a collar tie. When you see the reaching, block with your hand and circle to the side they reached with. Then reset back to a neutral position. If they lock on to a collar tie before you can block their arm, then defend that with a shuck off or an over-tie or whatever other way you like to clear a collar tie. When you get comfortable, start clearing the tie then going immediately into a shot. This drill will help you use your opponent’s reach as a set up to your shot and train you to stay out of an ear to ear tie up. Check out this video of Bekzod Abdurakhminov where he teaches a double leg set up by posting up a collar tie.
Follow Drill
The next drill will help you get better at top and bottom. A follow drill is when you and your partner start out with one guy on bottom and one guy on top. The guy on bottom tries to move around without stopping by hitting sit outs, granby rolls, hip heists, and whatever else they want to try to escape the guy on top without doing a standup. This will help teach you to continuously move on bottom because in a match, if you just sit on bottom and aren’t trying to move, it makes it easy for your opponent to work pinning combinations on you. Good movement on bottom is key to earning escapes.
This drill also helps the top guy by forcing them to anticipate how the guy on bottom is going to move. Think of it as trying to ride a guy out for the win in double overtime.
Whizzer Single Leg Drill
One very common position that wrestlers at all levels find themselves in is holding onto a single leg while there opponent defends it with a whizzer. Since this is such a common position, it makes sense to practice what to do when you get in it. So you lock up a single leg and let your partner get in on a whizzer. From there, at a slow pace, practice different finishes and defenses to the whizzer. When you feel comfortable with them, increase the intensity until you are basically going at a live pace.

Advanced Techniques
Throws and Takedowns
Throws and takedowns are crucial skills in freestyle wrestling that can help you gain an advantage over your opponent. These advanced techniques require precision, timing, and a combination of strength and technique. Here are some throws and takedowns commonly used in freestyle wrestling training:
Double Leg Takedown: The double leg takedown is a classic move where you shoot in on your opponent’s legs, driving them to the mat and gaining control. It involves grabbing both legs and using explosive power to take your opponent down.
Single Leg Takedown: The single leg takedown is another effective move that involves attacking one of your opponent’s legs. You can execute it by grabbing the leg, driving forward, and taking your opponent down to the mat.
Fireman’s Carry: The fireman’s carry is a dynamic move that involves lifting your opponent’s body and carrying them over your shoulder. It requires a combination of speed, agility, and strength to execute properly.
Suplex: The suplex is a high-risk, high-reward move that involves lifting your opponent off the ground and throwing them backwards. It requires excellent technique and control to avoid injury to both yourself and your opponent.
Pinning and Escapes
Once you have successfully taken your opponent down, the next step is to secure a pin or escape from your opponent’s control. Pinning your opponent involves immobilizing their shoulders to the mat for a certain amount of time, while escapes help you break free from your opponent’s control. Here are some advanced techniques for pinning and escapes:
Crucifix Pin: The crucifix pin is a highly effective technique where you trap your opponent’s arm and leg, rendering them unable to escape. It requires precise positioning and leverage to maintain control and secure the pin.
Granby Roll: The Granby roll is a popular escape technique used when your opponent has you in a compromising position on the mat. It involves rolling and using momentum to escape and regain control.
Peterson Roll: The Peterson roll is a dynamic move that allows you to go from being on the bottom to securing a pin on your opponent. It involves using your opponent’s momentum against them and executing a quick roll to gain control.
Transitions and Reversals
Transitions and reversals are essential skills in freestyle wrestling that allow you to quickly change positions and gain an advantage over your opponent. These advanced techniques require a combination of agility, timing, and technique. Here are some transitions and reversals commonly used in freestyle wrestling:
Switch: The switch is a technique used when your opponent has you in a controlling position on the mat. It involves quickly rotating your hips and changing directions to reverse the situation and gain control.
Granby Series: The Granby series is a sequence of techniques that involve using momentum and quick movements to transition from one position to another. It includes the Granby roll mentioned earlier, as well as other variations like the Granby tilt and Granby gut wrench.
Hip Heist: The hip heist is a fundamental movement used to create space and regain control when your opponent has you on the ground. It involves shifting your hips and explosively pushing off the mat to reverse the situation.
By mastering these advanced techniques in throws and takedowns, pinning and escapes, as well as transitions and reversals, you can elevate your freestyle wrestling skills to a whole new level. Practice these moves diligently, focus on proper technique, and constantly refine your execution to become a formidable competitor in the sport.
Strength and Conditioning
Cardiovascular Endurance
Cardiovascular endurance plays a crucial role in freestyle wrestling training. This aspect of conditioning refers to the ability of the heart, lungs, and blood vessels to deliver oxygen to the working muscles efficiently. In a sport like wrestling that requires bursts of intense activity, having a high level of cardiovascular endurance is essential.
To improve cardiovascular endurance, wrestlers can engage in various exercises such as running, swimming, cycling, or using the elliptical machine. These activities help increase heart rate, improve lung capacity, and enhance overall endurance. Incorporating high-intensity interval training (HIIT) into the workout routine can also be beneficial. This involves alternating between short bursts of intense exercise and periods of active recovery. HIIT helps simulate the energy demands experienced during a wrestling match and improves cardiovascular performance.
Strength Training
Strength training plays a vital role in freestyle wrestling as it enables wrestlers to overpower opponents and execute powerful moves. It involves exercises that target major muscle groups, including the legs, core, and upper body. Building strength not only enhances wrestling performance but also reduces the risk of injuries.
Common strength training exercises for wrestlers include squats, deadlifts, bench presses, pull-ups, and shoulder presses. These compound exercises work multiple muscle groups simultaneously, mimicking the demands of wrestling movements. Wrestlers can also incorporate plyometric exercises like box jumps, medicine ball throws, and explosive push-ups to develop explosive power.
It is important to note that strength training should be performed with proper technique and progressively increased weights to avoid injuries. Wrestlers can work with a qualified strength and conditioning coach to design a program tailored to their specific needs.
Flexibility and Mobility
Flexibility and mobility are crucial for freestyle wrestlers as they require a wide range of motion to execute various techniques effectively. Flexibility refers to the ability to stretch muscles and tendons, while mobility refers to the ability to move joints freely through their full range of motion.
To improve flexibility, wrestlers can incorporate static stretching exercises into their training routine. These stretches involve holding a specific position for a prolonged period, targeting specific muscle groups. Dynamic stretching, which involves moving through a range of motion, can also be beneficial for warming up before training or competing.
Mobility exercises focus on improving joint range of motion and can include exercises such as hip circles, shoulder rotations, and ankle mobility drills. Yoga and Pilates can also help improve both flexibility and mobility while promoting core strength and balance.
In conclusion, a comprehensive freestyle wrestling training program should include elements of cardiovascular endurance, strength training, and flexibility/mobility exercises. By focusing on these aspects of strength and conditioning, wrestlers can enhance their overall performance, reduce the risk of injuries, and gain a competitive edge in the sport.
Drills and Practice
Shadow Wrestling
Shadow wrestling is an essential component of freestyle wrestling training. This drill involves practicing moves and techniques without an actual opponent. It allows wrestlers to improve their footwork, balance, and overall technique. Shadow wrestling is a great way to perfect wrestling moves by focusing solely on the execution of each technique.
To perform shadow wrestling, find a clear space and visualize an opponent in front of you. Practice your takedowns, throws, and escapes as if you were in an actual match. Focus on maintaining proper form, speed, and fluidity of movements. It is important to incorporate different scenarios and angles to simulate real wrestling situations.
Live Wrestling
Live wrestling is the most realistic and challenging form of training in freestyle wrestling. This drill involves actual combat with a partner, allowing wrestlers to apply techniques and strategies in a dynamic and unpredictable environment. It helps improve timing, reaction speed, endurance, and mental toughness.
During live wrestling sessions, wrestlers engage in controlled sparring matches with a partner. The objective is to score points by executing takedowns, escapes, and pins. It is crucial to focus on maintaining proper technique and adapting to your opponent’s movements. Live wrestling provides an opportunity to practice offensive and defensive tactics, as well as develop a strong sense of anticipation and reaction.
Partner Drills
Partner drills are an effective way to enhance coordination, communication, and teamwork in freestyle wrestling. These drills involve working with a training partner to practice specific techniques and movements. Partner drills help wrestlers develop a deeper understanding of timing, distance, and leverage.
One common partner drill in freestyle wrestling is the takedown drill. In this drill, wrestlers take turns attempting takedowns on each other while their partner defends and counters. This exercise promotes agility, balance, and quick thinking. Another example is the clinch drill, which focuses on maintaining control and positioning in the upper body.
Partner drills should be performed with proper supervision and safety precautions. It is important to communicate and establish a level of intensity that both partners are comfortable with. These drills provide valuable opportunities for wrestlers to refine their skills, build trust with their training partners, and simulate real match scenarios.
By incorporating shadow wrestling, live wrestling, and partner drills into their training, freestyle wrestlers can improve their technique, physical conditioning, and overall performance on the mat. These drills offer a well-rounded approach to mastering the art of freestyle wrestling.
Preparation and Recovery
Warm-up and Stretching
Before engaging in any freestyle wrestling training, it is crucial to properly warm up your body and perform stretching exercises. A good warm-up routine increases blood flow to the muscles, raises your body temperature, and prepares your joints for the intense physical activity ahead. This helps reduce the risk of injuries and enhances your overall performance.
To warm up effectively, start with a light cardiovascular exercise such as jogging or jumping rope for about 5-10 minutes. This gets your heart rate up and primes your body for action. Following the cardio warm-up, transition into dynamic stretching exercises. Dynamic stretches involve moving parts of your body through a full range of motion while gradually increasing the intensity. Examples of dynamic stretches for freestyle wrestling could include arm circles, leg swings, and trunk rotations. These exercises help to improve flexibility, increase muscle activation, and enhance coordination.
Nutrition and Hydration
Proper nutrition and hydration play a vital role in maximizing your performance during freestyle wrestling training. It is essential to fuel your body with the right nutrients to optimize energy levels, enhance muscle recovery, and support overall health.
Aim for a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods such as lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Proteins are particularly important for wrestlers as they aid in muscle repair and growth. Include sources like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, and plant-based proteins in your meals. Carbohydrates provide the necessary energy for your workouts, so opt for complex carbohydrates like whole grain bread, brown rice, and quinoa.
In addition to proper nutrition, staying hydrated is crucial for optimal performance. Water is essential for regulating body temperature, lubricating joints, and transporting nutrients to muscles. Aim to drink water throughout the day and increase your intake during training sessions. Avoid sugary drinks or excessive caffeine as they can lead to dehydration.
Rest and Injury Prevention
Rest and recovery are often overlooked aspects of freestyle wrestling training, but they are just as important as the actual workouts. Giving your body time to recover allows for muscle repair and growth, reducing the risk of overuse injuries and fatigue.
Ensure you have dedicated rest days in your training schedule. These rest days give your body a chance to recuperate and rebuild. Additionally, prioritize getting enough quality sleep each night, as it is during sleep that your body undergoes essential repairs and recovery processes.
To prevent injuries, it is crucial to listen to your body and avoid overtraining. Pushing yourself too hard without proper rest can lead to burnout and increase the likelihood of injuries. Incorporate recovery techniques such as foam rolling, stretching, and light exercises on rest days to promote blood circulation and muscle relaxation.
Remember, preparation and recovery are key elements in freestyle wrestling training. By warming up properly, fueling your body with the right nutrients, staying hydrated, and allowing ample rest, you can optimize your performance, prevent injuries, and achieve your wrestling goals.
In conclusion, freestyle wrestling training is a comprehensive and dynamic approach to developing the skills and techniques necessary for success in the sport. By incorporating a variety of exercises that focus on strength, agility, and technique, wrestlers can enhance their performance in the ring. From mastering takedowns and escapes to improving endurance and flexibility, the training methods discussed in this article provide a solid foundation for wrestlers of all levels. With dedication, discipline, and regular practice, individuals can refine their skills and achieve their goals in the world of freestyle wrestling. So, lace up your boots, hit the mat, and embark on a journey of growth and excellence in freestyle wrestling.

Mastering the Single Leg Takedown in Freestyle Wrestling
Are you looking to enhance your skills in freestyle wrestling and dominate your opponents with ease? Look no further! In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the art of mastering the single leg takedown. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced wrestler aiming to refine your technique, this article will provide you with valuable insights, tips, and step-by-step instructions to help you excel in this essential move. Get ready to take your freestyle wrestling prowess to new heights and leave your competitors in awe.
The Basics of the Single Leg Takedown
The single leg takedown is a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling that can provide a significant advantage over your opponent. It involves taking control of one of your opponent’s legs and bringing them down to the ground while maintaining control. Mastering this technique requires a combination of proper footwork, positioning, gripping techniques, and a well-executed level change and penetration step.
Footwork and Positioning
Having correct footwork and positioning is crucial for a successful single leg takedown. To begin, establish a solid wrestling stance with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. This stance allows for better balance and agility, enabling you to react quickly to your opponent’s movements.
When going for a single leg takedown, step forward with your lead leg towards your opponent’s lead leg. Your lead leg should be outside of your opponent’s lead leg, creating an angle that provides a better opportunity to attack. Maintain a low center of gravity, keeping your head up and eyes focused on your opponent’s upper body.
Gripping Techniques
Proper gripping techniques are essential for gaining control of your opponent’s leg during a single leg takedown. There are various gripping options, but two common techniques are the high crotch grip and the ankle pick grip.
The high crotch grip involves reaching your same-side arm across your opponent’s body and securing a hold on their upper thigh, just below their hip. This grip allows for better control and leverage when executing the takedown.
The ankle pick grip, on the other hand, involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle with your same-side hand. This grip is effective when your opponent’s leg is extended or when they resist the high crotch grip.
Experiment with different gripping techniques and find the one that works best for you based on your opponent’s positioning and reactions.
Level Change and Penetration Step
Executing a proper level change and penetration step is the key to successfully completing a single leg takedown. A level change involves dropping your level by bending your knees and lowering your hips closer to the ground. This motion helps you avoid your opponent’s attacks and allows for a smoother transition into the takedown.
After the level change, perform a penetration step by driving your lead leg forward and shooting it towards your opponent’s leg. Simultaneously, reach for your desired grip on their leg, either high crotch or ankle pick. The penetration step should be explosive and quick, catching your opponent off guard and making it harder for them to defend.
Remember to maintain a strong grip, keep your head up, and drive through your opponent’s leg as you finish the takedown. Proper execution of the level change and penetration step, combined with precise footwork and effective gripping techniques, will greatly increase your chances of mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Common Variations of the Single Leg Takedown
High Crotch
The high crotch is a powerful and effective variation of the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg with your head positioned on the outside of their body. By grabbing their leg with both hands, you can drive forward and lift their leg off the ground, taking them down to the mat. The high crotch is known for its versatility, as it can be executed from various positions and angles. It requires good timing, speed, and technique to successfully execute the high crotch and secure the takedown.
Ankle Pick
Another common variation of the single leg takedown is the ankle pick. As the name suggests, this technique involves grabbing your opponent’s ankle and pulling it towards you, destabilizing their balance and setting up the takedown. The ankle pick is often executed when your opponent is in a defensive stance or when they are attempting to sprawl to defend against a regular single leg takedown. By quickly snatching their ankle and driving forward, you can bring them down to the mat and gain control.
Knee Tap
The knee tap is a variation of the single leg takedown that focuses on targeting your opponent’s knee for a swift takedown. This technique involves shooting in on your opponent’s leg, much like a regular single leg takedown, but instead of grabbing their leg, you aim to tap or push their knee with your hand. By applying pressure on their knee and redirecting their momentum, you can force them off balance and bring them down to the mat. The knee tap is particularly effective against opponents who have a strong base and are difficult to lift off the ground.
These variations of the single leg takedown provide wrestlers with a range of options to take down their opponents in freestyle wrestling. Each technique has its own advantages and requires practice to master. By incorporating these variations into your arsenal, you can become a more well-rounded wrestler with multiple takedown options at your disposal.
Defending Against the Single Leg Takedown
Sprawling
Sprawling is a crucial defensive technique when countering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling. It involves using your hips and legs to create distance and prevent your opponent from getting a hold of your leg. To perform a sprawl effectively, follow these steps:
Remember, practicing sprawls regularly is essential to develop the speed, timing, and technique required to defend against the single leg takedown effectively.
Whizzer and Overhook
Another effective method to defend against the single leg takedown is by utilizing the whizzer and overhook techniques. These techniques are especially useful when your opponent manages to secure a grip on your leg. Here’s how to execute the whizzer and overhook:
By mastering the whizzer and overhook techniques, you can effectively neutralize your opponent’s single leg takedown attempts and gain an advantage in the match.
Front Headlock
The front headlock is another valuable defensive technique that can be utilized to counter the single leg takedown. This technique involves controlling your opponent’s head and arm to prevent them from successfully executing the takedown. Here’s how to perform a front headlock:
Practicing the front headlock technique will not only enhance your defense against the single leg takedown but also open up various offensive possibilities.
Remember, mastering these defensive techniques takes time, practice, and repetition. By focusing on your sprawl, whizzer and overhook, and front headlock skills, you will significantly improve your ability to defend against the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling.
Drills to Improve Single Leg Takedown
Shadow Drilling
Shadow drilling is a fundamental training technique that helps wrestlers perfect their single leg takedown. By visualizing an opponent and performing the movements without actual resistance, wrestlers can focus on their form and technique. Here are some key drills to incorporate into your shadow drilling routine:
Stance and Motion: Start by assuming the proper wrestling stance, with your lead leg forward and your weight distributed evenly. Practice moving in and out of your stance, circling, and level changing. This drill helps develop agility and quick footwork, which are crucial for executing a successful single leg takedown.
Penetration Step: The penetration step is the initial move in a single leg takedown. Practice driving off your back leg, stepping forward with your lead leg, and shooting your arm deep between your opponent’s legs. Focus on explosive power and maintaining a low center of gravity throughout the movement.
Finish Position: Once you have secured your opponent’s leg, it’s important to practice the proper finish position. Work on driving through your opponent, lifting their leg, and keeping your head up. Pay attention to your hand placement and grip, as they significantly impact your control over your opponent.
Partner Drills
Partner drills provide a dynamic training experience that simulates real-life wrestling scenarios. These drills help develop timing, coordination, and the ability to react to an opponent’s movements. Incorporate the following partner drills into your training regimen to enhance your single leg takedown skills:
Leg Defense Drill: Have your partner stand in a defensive position while you attempt single leg takedowns. Your partner’s goal is to sprawl and defend against your takedown attempts. Focus on properly executing your takedown technique while your partner tries to counter and defend. This drill improves your ability to read and react to your opponent’s movements.
Resistance Drill: Start in a neutral position with your partner. Initiate a single leg takedown while your partner provides resistance, forcing you to exert more effort to complete the takedown. This drill helps build strength and endurance while maintaining proper technique under pressure.
Counter Drill: In this drill, your partner attempts a single leg takedown while you work on countering their move. Practice sprawling, sprawling and turning, or executing a defensive technique like a whizzer. This drill improves your defensive skills and teaches you how to disrupt your opponent’s takedown attempts.
Live Situational Sparring
Live situational sparring involves engaging in controlled wrestling scenarios with a partner. It allows wrestlers to apply their single leg takedown skills in a realistic, dynamic setting. Here are some situational sparring scenarios to incorporate into your training:
Starting from Neutral: Begin the sparring session from a neutral position, with both you and your partner on your feet. Focus on initiating single leg takedown attempts while your partner defends and counters. This scenario simulates the unpredictability of a real wrestling match and helps sharpen your takedown skills under live conditions.
Starting from a Specific Position: Start the sparring session from various positions, such as starting with one wrestler already in on a single leg. This situation allows you to practice defending against an opponent in a dominant position and finding opportunities to counter and execute your own takedown.
Live Wrestling with Specific Objectives: Set specific objectives for the sparring session, such as scoring points with a single leg takedown or successfully defending against your partner’s takedown attempts. This type of situational sparring helps wrestlers focus on particular aspects of their single leg takedown game and improve their overall strategy.
By incorporating these drills and sparring scenarios into your training routine, you can enhance your single leg takedown skills and become a more formidable wrestler in freestyle wrestling. Practice diligently, stay focused, and never stop refining your technique.
In conclusion, mastering the single leg takedown in freestyle wrestling is a crucial skill that can greatly enhance a wrestler’s performance. By understanding the proper technique, positioning, and timing, wrestlers can effectively take down their opponents and gain an advantage in matches. The single leg takedown offers a versatile and reliable option for both offensive and defensive strategies, making it a fundamental move in freestyle wrestling. With consistent practice and dedication, wrestlers can develop their skills and become proficient in executing this technique. So, whether you are a beginner or an experienced wrestler, mastering the single leg takedown is an essential step towards achieving success in freestyle wrestling.

Wrestling is a sport that requires both offensive and defensive techniques to succeed. When a wrestler finds themselves in the bottom position, they must focus on escaping or reversing their position to gain an advantage over their opponent. In this article, we'll explore the different wrestling moves from the bottom position and how they can help a wrestler succeed.
What this article covers:
Wrestling Pins:
One of the most common ways to win a wrestling match is through a pin. In the bottom position, wrestlers must focus on avoiding the pin while working to escape or reverse their position. This can be done through a variety of techniques, including the stand-up, switch, and granby roll.

The bottom position can be a thorn in the side of many wrestlers and coaches. This is typically most obvious when a wrestler moves up a level. It is almost expected for middle school wrestlers going to high school and high school wrestlers moving to the college ranks to all struggle in the bottom position.,"Bottom Position Wrestling: Turning My Weakness Into a Strength. How Being Bad At the Down Position Pushed Me To My NCAA Title
In my Sophomore year at Iowa, we took second at the National Tournament and as a team, we struggled a bit throughout the year. I was the starting 158 lber that year and was having a season with some ups and downs. My biggest weakness was the bottom position and it caught up to me one night in Minneapolis.
We went on the road to wrestle U of Minnesota and we lost the dual. I lost a match in that dual because I couldn’t get out from the bottom position.
Coach Gable gave us a looong talk on the way home and in my shame of losing that night I stood in front of the team and said I would never lose a match again because I couldn’t get out from the bottom.
Well, the damage was done and when we got back the coaches told me they were bringing Joe Williams out of redshirt and we would wrestle off that week. We wrestled off and I lost. I was devastated, Lincoln McIlravy was at the weight class below and things weren’t looking good.
Even though I wasn’t in a good spot I still had my eyes set on being an All-American, so I dropped two weight classes to 142, made the team, and ended up gaining All-American honors that year. I feel that if my bottom wrestling was better I wouldn’t have been in that position and I would have gotten the job done at a more natural weight class that year.
The devastating effects of not being prepared in the bottom position popped up again my senior year. I had my sights set on winning a National Title before I left Iowa but I had two defending NCAA Champs in my weight class. I wrestled one of them, Mark Branch, in January and lost by Major Decision because of my inability to get away from him. The last month of the season Jimmy Zalesky taught me some rock-solid strategies for staying out of and clearing legs and Coach Gable put everyone we had in the room that ever threw a leg on top of me. He would have them shark me and at first it WAS NOT FUN.
By the time the Big Ten’s rolled around NOBODY could ride me more than a couple of seconds. After my Sophomore year experience, I had developed a great Stand-up Series and NOW nobody could ride me with legs. I had so much confidence in my bottom position that I felt invincible. The rest is history, I went on to beat both of the defending National Champs at the NCAA’s and won the National Title. Without the setbacks and hard times that motivated me to master the bottom position, I wouldn’t have won the NCAA’s my Senior year.
1-2 Punch for Bottom Mastery
The bottom position can be a thorn in the side of many wrestlers and coaches.  This is typically most obvious when a wrestler moves up a level.  It is almost expected for middle school wrestlers going to high school and high school wrestlers moving to the college ranks to all struggle in the bottom position.  An experienced coach sees this coming and will try to find ways to keep this from happening.
Several core principles stand out to me from the bottom position.  If wrestlers can understand these wrestling moves and strategies from the bottom they will often overcome their bottom struggles quickly.  Many times escaping from the bottom position is a matter of hustle and grit, but it is also like solving a puzzle.  If a wrestler is moving frantically, they can often find themselves flat on their belly with arms tied up and fighting for their life.  If they hustle with the proper fundamentals in mind their fight will be much more efficient and effective.  This is easier said than done, but if this is to be accomplished then simplicity is a major factor.
Standing Up/Getting to Your Feet
The Stand Up is the most fundamental method of escaping your opponent.  Every wrestler should understand how to execute a Stand Up.  More importantly, they should understand the position they should be in once they get to their feet and how to Hip Heist or clear away from opponents.  Most wrestlers struggle with the stand up because they are taught to explode off the whistle straight to their head up and all motion shooting to the ceiling.  This is the way I was taught and the way I taught it for a long time.
The problem with this is that it’s like shooting craps.  If the wrestler can get to their feet this method can work out well.  If the top wrestler chops, grabs an ankle, bumps off the whistle or does many other things it can get ugly for the bottom wrestler very quick.  I would suggest rather than trying to explode to the ceiling, have the bottom wrestler explode to a position where they find backpressure, hand control, and have a stable base under them.  In this position, they will be able to backpressure to their feet, hip heist away, or defend breakdown attempts from their opponent before getting away.
Watch this video to view an example of what I am talking about.
The technique in this video is being taught for a situation when the top wrestler is going for an outside ankle off the whistle.
The standard version of the Windshield Wiper Stand Up would have the bottom wrestler sealing off the inside elbow to keep his opponent’s hands from getting inside. As the bottom wrestler wheels into his backpressure, he would be looking to attack the top wrestler’s hand that is around the waist with both of his hands.
If the top wrestler is bumping or chopping and knocking the bottom wrestler off balance the bottom wrestler may need to post his hands on the mat to keep his balance and keep his hips under him. Returning to hand control as fast as possible.
Don’t Get to Your Feet…  Sit Out?  Get Your Hands in the Mat!
If the bottom wrestler is broken down one easy thing they can focus on is to dig their hands in the mat. This will keep their arms from getting tied up and allow them to start pushing back into their opponent, slide their hips under them and work other holds from the mat or get back to their feet.A Sit Out may be a good option for this position. The bottom wrestler can almost always get to their rear into a Sit Out position and has many options from that position.
Here is a video that demonstrates what I am talking about and shows how the bottom wrestler digs their hands into the mat.
Obviously, there are a ton of ways to get the job done from the bottom position. This is just one way I like to break things down and keep them simple.
What do you think? I am sure there are a lot of opinions on the best ways to handle bottom troubles. I would love to hear them. Please post below and I will be sure to jump in on the conversation.
Train Hard!– Coach Weber

What is an Escape in Wrestling?
An escape in wrestling is a technique used to break the hold of an opponent by either reversing it or creating enough space for yourself that you can get away.
It’s important to note that escapes are not only used when you’re in an offensive position but they can also be used when you’re in a defensive position. Wrestling skillset and physical strength play a role in many escapes, but good technique is the most important factor for a successful escape.

Wrestling Escapes From Bottom Position
The most common wrestling escapes from the bottom position are Granby Roll, sucker drag, clear arm sucker drag, mule kick, beaking cradle, sitout hip heist, and Turtle roll. All these techniques help the wrestler to stand up or move away from an inferior position and gain control of the fight.
Bottom positions are the most dangerous positions in wrestling and thus escaping from them successfully is very important. These techniques help wrestlers to protect themselves against being pinned or put into submission holds. Wrestlers should always practice these techniques to improve their bottom game and increase their chances of winning matches.
Escaping from the bottom position is essential for a wrestler to be successful. Wrestlers should practice these moves regularly and understand the importance of being able to escape from inferior positions. With practice and dedication, these techniques can easily become second nature to the wrestler and make a big difference in their matches.
How Much is an Escape Worth in Wrestling?
In wrestling, an escape is worth one point. This means that if a wrestler escapes from the bottom position and stands up, they will be awarded one point. However, the wrestler must remain standing up in order to be successful and score the point. If they go back down or get put on a submission hold, the point will not be awarded.
Escape can be a crucial factor in deciding matches and can make the difference between winning and losing. It is important for a wrestler to have good technique when attempting to escape from the bottom position and be able to time it correctly in order to score the point.
What Wrestling Styles Benefit From Escaping?
All wrestling styles benefit from being able to escape from the bottom position. Greco-Roman and Freestyle wrestlers must be able to escape from inferior positions in order to score points and win matches.
In Folkstyle wrestling, escaping can help wrestlers avoid being put into submission holds or pinned and grant them time to get back in control of the match. Also, escaping can help wrestlers score points in Folkstyle matches, since they will be awarded one point if they escape from the bottom position and remain standing up.
How to Escape a Cradle in Wrestling?
To escape a cradle in wrestling, the wrestler must first turn their body away from the opponent. This will create space between them and make it easier to escape. The wrestler can then use their legs and arms to push off the opponent’s body, creating more space before standing up. This will help them escape the cradle and gain control of the match. The wrestler should also be aware of their opponent’s arms and make sure that they do not get caught in a submission hold.
Can I Practice Escapes at Home?
Yes, you can practice escapes at home. This is important for developing the muscle memory and technique necessary to escape from bad positions in wrestling.
You can practice by having someone hold you in a bad position, such as the bottom position, and then practicing escaping from it. You can also use objects, such as pillows and mats, to simulate the situation. It’s important to practice wrestling workouts at home to further improve your technique and condition yourself for the sport.
Conclusion
Wrestling escapes are essential for a successful wrestler. There are many different techniques and moves that can be used to escape from a bad position and gain control of the match. Some of the most common escapes are Granby Roll, sucker drag, clear arm sucker drag, mule kick, beaking cradle, sitout hip heist, and Turtle roll.
Knowing when to use these techniques is important for a successful escape from the bottom position. Additionally, an escape is worth one point in wrestling and can be the deciding factor in a match. With practice and dedication, wrestlers can master these techniques and become successful wrestlers.",0.90601,,,,,,,,,,

A cradle is a great way to pin your opponent that works even at the high levels of wrestling. There are basically two types of cradles, a farside cradle or a nearside cradle. Both are highly effective and have many different setups and ways to finish. In this technique video, Hudson Taylor, who was an NCAA All-American and in the top 10 pinners in NCAA history, shows a nearside cradle with a roll through finish from a front headlock position. Check out the video and watch exactly how he does it.
This is a highly effective cradle, but there are also a lot of technical aspects to it, meaning this isn’t a beginner move. Before you go out and start trying to hit this cradle, be sure you feel comfortable in a front headlock position.

To start the setup of this cradle, you need to have your opponent in a front headlock. The position that Taylor shows is not a typical closed or open front headlock, but rather he reaches all the way across with his arm to secure the tricep and pulls it in tight to the chin. Pay attention to this when you watch the video. Also, be sure to look at how he is applying pressure in the front headlock position. His shoulder is at the base of his opponent’s neck making them carry all of his weight. By putting a lot of pressure on your opponent, it makes it much more difficult for them to drag out of the front headlock and follow you when you are circling while hunting for the ankle.
After the front headlock is secured, watch how he “puts the head in the hole” and secures the ankle. While he is doing this, he is keeping his other elbow tight so the head and arm stay secure. If you are having trouble getting to the ankle, you can try to incorporate a small sitout to help you secure the ankle. Be sure to keep the head deep in the hole throughout the entire movement. Once the ankle is secured, slide up to the knee.
From this position, you are going to keep everything really tight and roll towards your opponent’s feet and end up on your back. Be sure to keep the tricep nice and tight throughout the whole movement. Then continue the motion and pop your head out. At this point your opponent should be on their side; let go of the triceps and lock your hands together.
In the video, when Taylor is demonstrating the move, he pauses while he is on his back halfway through the movement to explain what he is doing, but in a real life situation, the roll through will be one continuous movement.
Now that you have the nearside cradle locked up, step over your opponent’s top leg. Watch how Taylor does this in the video, he steps over with one knee and kind of slides the leg forward then steps over with the other knee. From here, he steps up with the near leg and looks for the pin while using his head to tripod up.
When you have the cradle locked up, be sure to be patient at this point. You have your opponent in a really bad position, you don’t need to rush anything. Take your time and make sure everything is nice and tight before you take your opponent to their back and look for the pin.
Getting good a cradles is a great way to get a lot of pins. They are highly effective and can be hit from a variety of different positions. Make sure you practice and drill moves like this roll through cradle before you try to use it in a match. Hopefully it will help increase your pins next season.

Tutorial Showing a Front Headlock Head In The Hole Near Side Cradle. Great Move. Get The Pin Or Fall From Your Front Headlock Subscribe for more wrestling technique videos, many more coming soon!
This video is for folkstyle and freestyle wrestling. From your short offense you can also take a guy to his back to get a 5 point move from neutral. You want to score points first, but if you see the window, go for the pin. This move will come from a snap down or a sprawl when you block their attempted shot.
When you put the head in the hole, a cradle may open up. You will do this maneuver similar to a near side bow and arrow cradle from the top. All comes from the head in the hole front headlock series. Use your head to put him on to his far hip. That gives you your 2 point takedown, from there you look to finish your cradle and get the fall.
This video is good for people who are new to wrestling and looking for instruction, for people just beginning or learning wrestling, or for anyone who wants to improve their wrestling basics or fundamentals.

Defending takedowns is an important part of wrestling. There are many different types of takedowns that your opponent might try against you. One very common shot is a high crotch. If your opponent gets in on a deep high crotch, you may not be able to get your hips back to counter with a sprawl. If that happens, you can defend the high crotch by sitting the corner. This is a very effective way to take away your opponent’s ability to transition a high crotch to a single or a double leg. It brings the wrestling down to the mat where you have the advantage.
In this video, two time NCAA champion and Olympian Ben Askren shows how to sit the corner and four ways to finish from the position.
First, when someone shoots in on a high crotch, you have to get their shoulder to outside of your hips. Watch how Askren pushes on his partner’s lat and does a circular sit down to the mat. Also notice the position of his free leg, it is bent not straight. Once down on the mat, you can lock your hands in the crotch, lock around the body, or you can pull the torso and leg into you without locking your hands. The important thing is you keep everything tight together.

The first and easiest finish from this position is to hook the ankle with your free leg and post on the mat with your hand so you can rotate your hips and end up with a leg ride and a takedown.
A second finish you can do from this position is to roll them over if they are driving into you. If you feel them really pressuring into you, post your free foot on the mat in between your legs and roll them over their top shoulder. After the roll, you should end up on top and they will most likely be holding onto the leg. You can do a couple things from this position. One thing Askren shows in the video is to lock up a near side cradle. If it is available, this is a great way to earn a pin. If the cradle is not available, slide your hips back and circle towards your opponent’s feet and cross face them to get the takedown.
A third way to finish in this position comes when they try to turn back into you once you have the leg hooked. Since the leg is hooked, they can’t get their foot back, so when they try to turn into you, it brings their head and knee close together and anytime the head and knee are close, it is cradle time.
There is another cradle you can hit from the sit the corner position. To set it up, you are going to lock your hands low on the leg and high on the body then drive him onto his shoulder. The hand that is on the body comes out and you slide it around the head to lock up the cradle. Once it is locked up, take him over to his back for the pin.
In this video, Askren shows this series when someone hits a high crotch, but this also works when someone shoots a single leg on you. You just have to push their head to the outside position first, then you can sit the corner.
As you can see, there are a lot of options from sitting the corner. Just remember to stay tight so they can’t run you over with their hips.

Under Hook Finish Drill,Drills to effectively finish moves when an underhook is secured focusing on control and takedown.,What are effective drills for finishing moves with an underhook in wrestling?,,,,,Learn Dominate Your Opponent With Underhooks - Fanatic Wrestling,https://fanaticwrestling.com/blogs/news/learn-dominate-your-opponent-with-underhooks,"First, he has inside head position and his lead leg is on the same side as the underhook. To hit the ankle pick, you need your opponent's far leg to be their lead leg so you will probably need to move your opponent around, circling, pushing, pulling, and snapping them in order to get them in the correct position.","Learn Dominate Your Opponent With Underhooks
Learning to dominate positions is a big part of getting better in wrestling. When you and your opponent start a match, you are both in a stance and have no contact. Neither wrestler has an advantage or disadvantage from this position, but once the whistle blows, the goal is to use hand fighting and pummeling to end up in a position that gives you an advantage and puts your opponent at a disadvantage. One great position that gives you a lot of advantage is an underhook.
If you are not very familiar with what an underhook is, check out this video where MMA star Chael Sonnen goes over the basics of an underhook.
From an underhook, you can pretty much hit any type of offense like ankle picks, single legs, double legs, throws, inside trips, and front headlocks to name just a few. Because underhooks are so versatile and effective, they are very important for all wrestlers at all levels to practice. If you are new to wrestling and want to learn some good underhook takedowns or if you are a seasoned veteran and want to refresh your memory with some great attacks from an underhook, here are a couple videos for you to watch.
High Crotch
In the first video, two time All-American Dan Vallimont show a basic high crotch from an underhook. A couple things you should take notice to in the video, first, look at his head position, it is on the inside. You can hit a high crotch with your head on the outside position, but it is a lot more difficult. Another thing to pay attention to is his underhook is not too deep and when he has it, his elbow is pointed down to the ground. Also, be sure when you hit this, your lead leg is on the same side as the underhook. When Dan shoots the shot, he uses an outside step, not a center step. Lastly, watch how Dan pressures into his opponent, and when he feels pressure back, he throw the arm hard but does not over extend his arm. It is very important to keep the arm tight to your body, if not, your opponent will hook your arm and use it to defend your shot.
Ankle Pick
An ankle pick is a great takedown from an underhook. In this video, two time NCAA All-American Hunter Stieber breaks down how to hit an ankle pick from an underhook. A couple things to watch for in the video. First, he has inside head position and his lead leg is on the same side as the underhook. To hit the ankle pick, you need your opponent’s far leg to be their lead leg so you will probably need to move your opponent around, circling, pushing, pulling, and snapping them in order to get them in the correct position. You can even fake a single leg to the near leg and when they react, hit the ankle pick.

Another thing to watch is how he blocks the ankle and throws the shoulder forward as he drives through his opponent. Often times, guys will pull the ankle into themselves and leave the underhook in and this can give your opponent a whizzer to defend with. The way Stieber does this eliminates that possibility.
High Single Leg
In this video, two time NCAA national champion and Olympian Ben Askren shows a high single leg from an underhook. A couple key points to this attack. First, Ben has inside head position and wrist control and this is ideal, but you can actually hit this same shot if your opponent has inside head position and has control of your wrist. You will also notice he uses an inside step with his far leg and uses the non-underhook hand to secure the leg then drops down with his underhook hand to secure the leg and drive it up. Make sure you don’t leave the underhook in too long or it give your opponent an opportunity to defend it.
Knee Pick
A knee pick is another great option from an underhook and when you watch the video, you will see how this knee pick and the previous video on the high single leg go together because if you try to hit the high single leg and your opponent steps their foot back defending it, it puts you in the perfect position to hit this knee pick.
A couple important things to point out about this knee pick. First, whether it comes from faking a shot or from you circling your opponent, their far leg needs to be their lead leg and they need to have a lot of weight on it. Secondly, you have to have a good angle to hit this, if you are facing your opponent, this won’t work. Another thing to watch is how Askren blocks down at the knee and drives through his opponent and shoots the other arm up into the air. If you don’t shoot your arm up into the air, your opponent will whizzer down on your arm and defend the takedown. Also, this is a great move for bigger guys. It keeps them from getting stuck underneath their opponent’s heavy hips.
The absolute most dominant position you can have when you have an underhook is to have inside head position and have control of your opponent’s far wrist. In a real match, it rarely happens that you get all three and that is okay. If you have an underhook and inside head position, it is not a big deal if your opponent has your wrist, it really shouldn’t stop you from hitting your takedowns. In fact, you can still hit a lot of takedowns even if your opponent has inside head position and has control of your wrist. Be sure to mess around with these different scenarios in practice to get comfortable in them.

Bader’s head is down, his butt is out, and he's backing away from the situation.

One thing that interests me is how certain techniques are taught, utilized, and passed on differently in certain areas of the country as opposed to others. For example, the above is a very “Minnesota” way of hitting an underhook. Why would Schlatter’s position be considered so “Minnesota” (aside from the obvious)? Look at the position: Schlatter is far more up-right. In Minnesota, they wrestle a lot more Greco than they do back East, which lends itself to a more upright stance and overall approach.
Watch Donny Pritzlaff teach how to get to an underhook and notice how he keeps head position while trying to take his opponent out if his stance with his free hand. This type of underhook can definitely be used for defense, but if you would like to attack off of it you’re going to have to stay extremely busy pulling and moving with your free hand.

Get To A Leg
The footwork involved here may be the trickiest part of the technique, only because doing in practice and doing it live are two very different things, but I’m confident that most people can learn to do this.

This is a slightly more dynamic version of the Chance Marsteller technique. I would suggest mastering it before you move on to this.
What If You Miss The Leg?
If you miss the single leg keep wrestling to the far knee. This is perfect for me because of the way that Coach Frayer describes the second half of the situation. He says to “run in front of him, not through him.” I actually stopped teaching this for a while simply because my guys were either getting head locked or lat-dropped when they went to a far knee. This video addresses and fixes that problem.

A Safe Underhook
What makes an underhook LOOK more defensive rather than offensive to me is where you put your head. Getting head position on a hook doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be offensive on that particular hook; it just means that you probably have more defensive options because your head is in the way.
When most people in this country want to get to an underhook they usually club with one hand and then throw their hook in with the other. Jon Reader shows a slick way of getting into the position from a wrist roll.

One of the nicest things about a defensive underhook is that you can easily pull them into a front headlock. Damion Hahn shows a great way to get into the position and then score from it.

Single-leg takedowns are techniques you can use while grappling your opponent to the ground. It is useful against tall and heavy opponents. Performing a high single-leg takedown is very easy to learn for beginners and involves grabbing your opponent around their knee. Mid-level and low takedowns are another variation you can try to get better precision and have more finishing options, but they may be more difficult to perform. By mastering both types of single-leg takedowns, you’ll be able to bring your opponent to the ground quickly and efficiently!
Steps
Completing a High Takedown
Tip: Ask someone of a similar skill level to slowly practice takedowns with you so you can improve your technique step by step.
Performing a Mid-Level or Low Takedown
Tip: You can also try lifting their heel up toward your shoulder to make them more off balance and limit their mobility. If you do this, maintain your grip on their ankle so they aren’t able to break free.

In amateur mat wrestling, the double-leg takedown is typically the first takedown taught to wrestlers. Executed properly, it can be an effective way of getting your opponent onto the mat. In mixed martial arts, it's a more complicated maneuver, somewhat less reliable because of the complexities of strikes and guards available, though it's still a commonly used takedown, especially from mat specialists.

A double leg takedown is one of the most basic and common takedowns in wrestling. When you are new to wrestling, it is one of the first takedowns most people are taught, but knowing how to shoot a double leg and being able to get in on a double leg are two separate things. To get in on shots, you need to use setups to create openings in your opponent’s defense. Here are four different setups that will help you to earn more takedowns with a double leg.
Post and Fake
The first set up, head posting and fake level changes, is probably the most basic set up a wrestler can do in wrestling, but it is so effective, you still see people using it at the highest levels of the sport. With this setup, you post on the head, use motion, and level changes to try to get your opponent to react. When you move and change levels, acting like you are going to shoot, your opponent will flinch getting ready to defend your shot until they realize that you did not actually shoot. In this brief moment, there will be an opening to shoot a double leg.
Watch this video of Ben Askren as he demonstrates how to use posting on the head, motion, and level changes to set up the shot. Pay attention to the distance he is at compared to his opponent. Also, watch the way he is circling and uses multiple head posts and level changes before he takes the shot. When you do this, be aware that you still need to maintain a good stance so you do not get shot on and the posts need to be on the head and not in the face.
Counter Posting the Arm
Another way you can set a double leg up is to use your opponent’s reach and post it up to go under it. When wrestlers are taught how to make first contact, one of the main points that is taught is not to reach because it leaves them vulnerable to getting shot on. This setup exploits this exact scenario. To do use this setup, when your opponent reaches for a collar tie, use your hand to post their hand up and that will make room to shoot a double leg.
Check out this video by Bekzod Abdurakhminov where he shows his version of the arm post. A couple things to pay attention to. First, notice he keeps his elbow in when he posts the arm up. Secondly, he is timing it so he is posting the arm up right as his partner makes contact. If you wait until the collar tie is tight, it is too late. Lastly, in the video, Bekzod shoots a double leg with an outside leg step to the near side, but you could shoot with either leg and to either side depending on what feels comfortable.

Misdirection
Using misdirection is a great way to set up a double leg. Misdirection is when you fake shooting to one side, get your opponent to react, then re-shoot to the other side. When doing a misdirection, you have to really sell the first shot. Often times wrestlers will try to do a misdirection to set up a shot, but their first shot is not believable so their second shot is not successful. It’s all about selling the first shot to get your opponent to react. This is done by actually lowering your level, reaching for a leg, and even looking in the direction of the fake helps to sell it.
In this video, three time NCAA champion Ed Ruth shows using misdirection to hit a double leg. Notice how he is using outside steps for his shots. This type of shot is all about timing, and the best way to develop it is with practice.
Overtie
It is very common in wrestling for your opponent to collar tie you. If you can catch their arm as they reach, you can post it up, but if you miss the arm and they secure the collartie you can clear it off with an overtie and hit a double leg. An overtie is when you basically collar tie over top of your opponent’s collar tie.
Watch this video of four time NCAA champion Logan Stieber where he shows how to use an overtie to hit a low double leg. Pay attention to how he uses the overtie to pull his opponent close and how he circles to and snaps to create an opening to shoot. You will also notice this is not a traditional double leg, it is more of a hybrid double leg with a low single. This is a great setup to practice because you see people getting collar tied in almost every match which means it readily available if you know what to look for.

This takedown is one of the first that beginners learn and although it looks very simple at first there are many details that differentiate successful from a failed double leg.
How to do double leg takedown
Lower your level by bending knees and shoot for takedown using your rear leg to push yourself to the opponent. At the same time, drop your lead leg knee in between of opponents legs (not recommended on hard surfaces) and grab his legs (around thighs ) and squeeze them together. Hold your chest and head tight next your opponents body to avoid guillotine. Pull rear leg to the outside of your opponents legs so both of your legs are parallel to each other. Once you have your legs in position and tight, secure hold on his legs, push up and to the side while pulling the opponent’s legs.
Remember use leverage and try not out muscle your opponent especially if he is bigger then you.  Double leg properly executed will leave you in the side control. For this sequence to be successful you need to it explosively and ideally, the best time to shoot for a double leg is when your opponent is going toward you or in the case of MMA/street fight punching.
Double Leg Takedown common mistakes
How to counter DL takedown

Step by Step Guide To The Fireman’s Carry Wrestling Takedown
If you’re looking for an effective takedown technique for BJJ, try looking into the Fireman Carry takedown. Why? Well, it works in wrestling and it works in Judo. That makes it Gi and No-Gi, plus applicable under any rulesets on top of the move obviously being a staple of two oly[pic level grappling sports. That’s all the pedigree you need when looking for effective moves to broaden your BJJ horizons.
What Is the Fireman’s Carry Takedown?
The Firman Carry position is one that is not just common in grappling martial arts, but also in the army and first aid circles. It is an effective way of carrying around a person’s weight without straining yourself. This automatically should put it on your radar as an effective Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu move to add to your arsenal.
The Fireman’s Carry wrestling move has you picking a person up and putting their torso along the length of your shoulders, leaving their head hanging on one side, and their legs on the other side of your body. The anchor points are usually one arm and one leg of the opponent, but as you’ll see in the variations depicted in this article, these can change according to your setup preferences.
After picking someone up in the position, which is essentially the tricky part, slamming them down is really not that difficult. there are directions that are optimal for both you and your opponent. Our step-by-step approach will ensure you understand just how easy it is to pick a grown person up on your shoulders and slam them to the ground at your convenience.
Step-by-Step Fireman’s Carry Wrestling Setup
While you might think there is shooting for the legs involved in a Fireman’s Carry throw when looking at people executing it, it is actually not true. The legs literally just happen to be in a position that helps bring attraction and direction to the throw, but the setup is all about upper body manipulation and angles.
This is why the move is easy to master – you only have to think about establishing grip and engaging one of the opponent’s arms, which is then going to open up entries and opportunities to pick them up and “run with them”. That leaves your mind to focus on just one task, as opposed to thinking about grabbing the arms while also shooting for the legs.
1. Engagement And Grips
As with every other throw and takedown, the Fireman’s Carry begins with grips and specific engagements. The initial control you need for the throw is of one of the opponent’s arms. There are different ways of gripping to set up the Fireman’s Carry wrestling takedown, but one you should avoid is the overhook, as it is going to telegraph your intentions to people that are aware of the move.
An inside biceps tie grip is common practice in wrestling and works perfectly in Jiu-Jitsu too. Gripping the triceps, Judo-style with the Gi, or directly in No-Gi is also a great alternative.
2. Creating Openings
Once you have the grip, you’re far from guaranteed a Frieman Carry throw. Entering into position to bait the opponent on top of you so you can lift them is where the magic happens.
Before you enter into a position, though, you’ll need to create a door to enter through, i.e. an opening. Elevating the arm you are controlling is the opening you’re after.
While lifting the arm directly might work against the less skilled opposition, you’ll need to play the action-reaction game against seasoned grapplers. Snapping the head down (or pretending to do so) is going to cause an upward motion of the opponent’s upper body, leaving little to do for you, as they’ll raise their arm for you, as long as you provide the correct direction.
3. Entry (Level Change)
The all-important part of any throw or takedown in grappling is entering into a position that will off-balance the opponent and allow you to execute the move in question. The entry for Fireman’s Carries is what makes them effective and attractive-looking.
It is actually much easier than it seems, once you’ve sussed out the grips and created an opening. Your aim is to get down deep underneath the opponent’s center of gravity. The entry is relatively straightforward – drop your knee between the opponent’s legs, opening up your body towards the side where you control their arm. A simple drop to both knees will do the trick.
4. Off-Balancing Your Opponent
No takedown (or sweep) will work without off-balancing an opponent first, the concept known in Judo as Kuzushi. Once you’re deep underneath the opponent, use the control you have over their arm via the grip to pull them on top of your shoulders, making them bend forward in the process.
Gravity will help you here, all you need is to drop quickly into the entry, holding on to the initial grip tightly, and the opponent will have no choice but to bend over in a last-ditch attempt to stay on their feet.
5. Controlling The Leg(s)
The one part I mentioned is not a big deal during a Fireman’s Carry takedown is controlling the legs. They are, however, helpful in giving you a direction for the throw, and helping you further off-balance the opponent.
When the knee drops in between the opponent’s legs, one arm usually sneaks in with it, opening up different controlling opportunities in terms of the legs. At the end of the day, all you need Is to grab them in order to flip the opponent over, which you can do by hugging the thigh low, right above knee level.
6. Finishing The Fireman’s Carry Takedown
The all-important finish of the Fireman’s Carry wrestling (and Judo) throw depends heavily on your understanding of which is the best direction to throw the opponent toward.
Remember that you don’t have to stand up to throw someone with Fireman’s Carry. In fact, it is much better if you remain on your knees, as you aim to topple the top person over.
There are two main directions where you can “dump” the opponent. One is to throw them to the side where their head points, which is the Judo version (a.k.a. Kata Guruma). Wrestlers often favor throwing the opponent forward, so they land in a much more precarious position that is easy to control. Ultimately, the direction is going to be a matter of choice and reading the situation and the opponent’s reactions.
Fireman’s Carry Technique Variations For BJJ
Apart from the step-by-step action described above, there are variations of the Fireman’s carry takedown you can use, depending on preferences and your own understanding of upper body tie-ups when standing.
Russian Tie Variation
The grips do not have to be either an inside biceps tie or a triceps grip. The Russian tie is an excellent way to set up a Kata Guruma. When you have the Russina tie position set up, you’ll need to circle your head inside the opponent’s trapped arm, so that you end up in a position for the Carry.
The tie-up is so powerful, though, that there’ll be no need for you to reach to control the legs. Throwing the opponent toward the direction of the head is optimal in this case.
Legless Variation
This variation of the Fireman’s Carry position works without leg grips, which helps mitigate the dangers, however small, of the top person entangling you into a crucifix position as you’re attempting to finish the throw.
Once again, you can use the Russian tie or any of the other grip options to set everything up. When the time comes to throw the opponent over, if inertia nad the grips have not done the trick, you can use the shoulder that this in between the opponent’s legs form the level change to ensure you get an extra push to finish the takedown.
Inverted Legless Variation
Here’s a variation coming from Sambo. It starts with a collar and sleeve control on the same side. Instead of elevating the arm before dropping for a level change entry, you push it across the opponent’s body with the sleeve grip, essentially entering the Firaman Carry position from the outside of the opponent’s body rather than the inside.
Head & Legs Fireman’s Carry Variation
There is also a wrestling version of the Fireman’s Carry where you enter into the position off of a front headlock instead of any type of arm control. While it requires a bit more dexterity and precision, it does offer a much more powerful off-balancing and is perfect for setting up forward finishing carries.
Armpit Variation
One more variation that allows you to adjust a Fireman’s Carry throw on the fly is the armpit variation. In this instance, the opponent’s arm ends up underneath your armpit as they reach for inverted body lock control to try and prevent the takedown.
This means you’ve lost the initial grip on their arm, but can re-adjust by grabbing their wrist and switching the direction of the throw. Instead of trying to throw the opponent forward or to the side of their head, you’ll throw yourself backward once you load them up on your shoulders.
Conclusion
The Fireman’s Carry is going to change your life after you give it a try and implement it in your takedown game. After all, you can go for the same move regardless of rulesets and in both Gi and No-Gi. That is what high-percentage grappling is all about.

It's when you start in a standing position and drop down with your knees and hips to grab the opponent's ankle, lift it, and push your opponent off-balance. Ankle Pick BJJ Demo.","Ankle Pick 101 (BJJ) – How to Execute Properly
The Ankle Pick is a popular BJJ takedown. It utilizes grabbing your opponent’s ankle while lifting it up and ensuring he can’t use his other leg for balance. By following these 3 general steps, you’ll be able to take down almost any grappler out there, if you, of course, perform it well enough.
This is my intention with this article, to teach you how to perform the Ankle Pick well enough to start seeing more and more results. You’ll be able to start practicing this takedown immediately after you finish reading this article.
Learning to wrestle in BJJ—can be quite daunting. However, I assure you that it won’t be nearly as complicated as some of you might think. Although it’s something new, which can always be frightening, it’s a move you’ll start using in your sparring and competitions soon after learning it.
I’ve thoughtfully ordered this article the way it is, to ensure everyone reading this article is able of executing the Ankle Pick flawlessly. You’ll need some training before that would be the case. However, the general theme here is that you’ll be able to take your opponent down to the mat easily.
You’ll also gain 2 points for taking your opponent down in a BJJ competition, which is a nice bonus. That’s enough intro, I want you guys to get on the mat already and train! So without further ado, let’s dive into the article!
What is the Ankle Pick in BJJ?
Although many novice grapplers aren’t aware of the fact that you can use takedowns in BJJ, it’s definitely possible. You’ll be able to take your opponent from a neutral to an inferior position, which is what we all really want to achieve in the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
One of the most popular ways you can do that is by using the Ankle Pick. You might not know what it is or what it looks like, which is what I’m here for. So let’s first define this wonderful, prevalent takedown.
The Ankle Pick is a takedown, typically seen in Wrestling and BJJ, but is also used in other close-ranged grappling-based martial arts, such as Judo and Sambo. It’s when you start in a standing position and drop down with your knees and hips to grab the opponent’s ankle, lift it, and push your opponent off-balance.
It’s similar to the Low Single, which you might be familiar with. The Ankle is a body part that’s often used to take the opponent off-balance. If you think about it, it’s the connection between the foot and the leg. So if you can make it stop doing its job, which is to keep the person balanced, you’ll be in a great position to either throw or take him down.
Now that we know the fundamental of the Ankle Pick, let’s dive into the most interesting and important part of this article (interesting and important typically comes together in BJJ.) How to perform it from different positions!
Ankle Pick Variations
So this will be the most interesting part of this article. It also is the most critical one, as learning the different variations each move has—is extremely important.
BJJ is all about options. You always have many options and you have to make a choice. So the more options you have, the more capable of a grappler you’ll be since you’ll be more dynamic. This is just the way it works.
Let’s assume you’re facing someone who knows 2 takedowns, but you know 10. You’ll be more likely to win the encounter, as you’re capable of reading the situation and deciding on one option that’s most likely to succeed in your eyes.
If you hesitate, you’ll be less likely to win, but that’s for another discussion.
It’s time we start reviewing the different variations and how to execute each one. Your next step after reading this article is to get on the mat and practice these variations. Indeed, these are the backbone of this guide.
So let’s dive into the 1st one.
#1 – Same-Side Ankle Pick
The 1st variation we’ll review is Same-Side Ankle Pick. This is the first one you should learn, as it’s the most intuitive to understand. Likewise, it’ll build the best foundation for you moving forward, which should be fantastic news for you.
Your first step is to start standing up to perform the Same-Side Ankle Pick. You then want to grab the opponent’s sleeves (same side grip), preferably in the elbow area (when wearing Gi.) Then, you want to drop drown with your knees and hips while maintaining your sleeve grips.
Finally, you reach and grab the opponent’s ankle, as low as you can go, while driving forward to knock your opponent off-balance and get the takedown.
Now it’s critical that you follow through by attaining a more dominant position, which can guard passing into Side Control or even attaining Full Mount.
If you don’t follow through, your opponent can start attacking you, especially if you don’t pull your hands back. It’s likely that he’ll try and perform the Armbar if you’re not careful once you knock him down. SO pay attention to that.
Here’s a visual aid for you:
#2 – Cross-Side Ankle Pick
The Cross-Side Ankle Pick is definitely more complicated than the 1st variation we reviewed. However, it can be a fantastic technique to attain a more dominant position easily.
When you perform the Same-Side variation, you might find it difficult to attain anything other than being on top guard. Although you’re still rather superior, it’s not as prominent.
With the Cross-Side variant, you’ll be able to take the opponent down and be in a perfect position to get Side Control. From there, you can either go for the Knee on Belly and attack, attain North-South and attack, or perhaps acquire the Full Mount and attack.
You first want to start standing to perform the Cross-Side Ankle Pick. You then want to grab the opponent’s back of the head and his sleeve. Next up, you switch your grips to grab the back of his head with your other hand while grabbing his chin with your original hand.
Once you establish that sort of Front Headlock, you drop down on your knees and grab his left ankle with your left hand (or the opposite.) You finish by driving yourself forward and knocking the opponent off-balance.
Please don’t forget to attain a more dominant position.
#3 – Pull Guard to Ankle Pick
The next variation we’ll review is essentially the same as the first one, which is the Same-Side one. However, it starts by going for a fake, which will make you more likely to make it work.
I’ve decided to dedicate an entire section to this one, although it acts and looks the same as the Same-Side Ankle Pick. Are you ready for it?
The Pull Guard is a fantastic way to attain the Guard position from a standing position. While it’s less important for the sake of understanding this variation, I’ll briefly go over it.
It’s essentially when you establish sleeve grips and lift your leg to place it on the opponent’s thigh (on the same side.) You then sit back and pull the opponent with you, attaining any Guard position. If you’re interested in learning about the best guard positions you must know to call yourself a grappler, follow this link.
Anyways, to perform the fake, all you have to do is lift your leg as if you’re about to place it on your opponent’s thigh. However, you don’t do that—but simply lift your leg. This will make the opponent react, perhaps defend, and you’ll be able to go for the Same-Side Ankle Pick (see 2 sections above.)
Inverted Ankle Pick
The Inverted Ankle Pick is a fantastic technique you want to start practicing after finishing this article. I’ve come across a superb instruction video by Hudson Taylor, which comes from a Wrestling background. I’ll include it at the end of this section.
Anyways, this variant utilizes a Cross-Side Grip, but it’s not the same as the 2nd one we reviewed. What’s different is the direction you’ll be cupping your opponent’s ankle. You won’t grab it the way you think you should, but the opposite way around. So from between his legs and clockwise for his left ankle.
You still want to attain a sleeve grip, as per usual. Then, you drop on your knees and cup the opponent’s cross ankle, and the direction you cup it will start between his legs and to the outside. You then lift the ankle you grabbed up while pulling his sleeve down to finish this takedown.
All in all, a great variation you want to start learning and using!
Ankle Pick Tips
So you now know to use the 4 variations of the Ankle Pick. You’re already in a much better position than most other grapplers. Of course, you’re not done yet. You still want to get on the mat and practice, which should be your next step.
Taking your grappling game to the next level includes stepping on the mat and getting repetitions in. If you only read this article or watch a few videos to complement your knowledge, you won’t be able to perform it nearly as well as if you take the time and effort to practice it in real time.
But now, before you do that, let’s review 3 tips you want to know about before stepping on the mat and executing this takedown.
#1 – Perfect your grips
The first tip is to perfect your grips. It might be difficult to understand when to use which grips, and that’s natural. I researched the Ankle Pick for a long time before I started to write this article, and even I am not sure when to use which one.
But there’s a rule of thumb that’ll help you navigate your way through this issue. The best grip you can use to complement this takedown is the Sleeve Grip. When you pull your opponent’s ankle up while pulling his sleeve down and toward you, you’ll cause your opponent to be more off-balance.
This is your end goal, to make sure the person you’re executing this one, is as off-balanced as possible.
#2 – Never step back
The next tip is to never step back. Although this might sound fairly unintuitive, hear me out. What stepping back does is give your opponent room to move forward and take you down.
The only way you should move is to the side, clockwise and counterclockwise. Avoid moving backward if possible.
#3 – Drop the opponent’s arms before going for his ankle
The last tip for executing a perfect Ankle Pick is dropping your opponent’s arms before going for his ankle. The most important grip you’re going to have isn’t the sleeve, but it’s his ankle.
After everything is said and done, this takedown is called Ankle Pick for a reason. I’m less interested in the grips you have than the fact that you’re able of grabbing his ankles in the first place!
A fantastic way of ensuring you’re able to grab your opponent’s ankles is by dropping his arms, especially if you have established grips on both his sleeves. Do that and you’ll be able to grab his ankles with ease.
Final Words
So this was the Ankle Pick, a fantastic way of taking your opponent down and attaining a more dominant position on him. It’ll also help you win more competitions, as it’ll grant you 2 points for completing it.
Your next step now is to get on the mat and practice what you learned. There’s no replacement for that.
But the Ankle Pick isn’t the most effective takedown you can learn. Follow this link to learn about the 9 most effective takedowns in BJJ and how to execute each one.

Examples of Ankle Pick From Wrestling Greats. Cael Sanderson is known for his ankle pick. A 4-time NCAA champion, Cael Sanderson is the only American wrestler to go undefeated in his collegiate wrestling career.","Ankle Pick: How to set up and Finish this Takedown
Ankle picks are very technical. Done right, it can be very effective and low risk. While executing an ankle pick, you are virtually never at risk of being in a bad position or of being put in a guillotine. However, the technique can be difficult to learn at first as there are many parts that need to be done right in order for the ankle pick to work. First, here’s how you perform an ankle pick. There may be some variations of this, but here is an example to start with.
Ankle Pick Mechanics
That’s how you execute your basic ankle pick. To fully understand the ankle pick, you need to understand set ups and finishes too.
Set Up
Most ankle picks are set up in one of three ways. You can pull the target leg forward, pull the non-target leg, or execute an ankle pick from open space.
Pulling the target leg is the most common way of hitting an ankle pick. When the target leg steps forward, you can execute this takedown. When the opponent’s weight is being pulled forward, the opponent will be unable to pull their leg backward. At the higher levels, this set up becomes easy to predict and you’ll eventually benefit from learning the other set up variations.
Pulling the non-target leg is the most common set up at the highest levels of wrestling. This set up works because when the opponent’s non-target leg is being pulled forward, the target leg is stuck on the mat and unable to move. This set up is effective because you don’t need to wait for your opponent’s leg to reach the mat before execution.
Open shot ankle picks are harder to execute because your timing with the collar tie and your attack arm has to be great. Since you are not forcing your opponent to move while executing an open shot, open shot ankle picks become harder to set up. If the only ankle pick set up in your repertoire is the open shot, you will become far too predictable after your first  attempt.
Finish
Finishing the ankle pick depends on the opponent’s reaction. The three main finishes are the basic finish, the single leg finish, or the double leg finish.
The basic finish is ideal. Your opponent falls backward and all you need to do is cover your opponent to secure your takedown.
Sometimes your opponent doesn’t fall backward, and your opponent returns to standing position. If your head is on the outside of the opponent’s body, you can finish your ankle pick by converting to a double leg takedown. This is usually the case with stronger opponents.
If your head is on the inside of the opponent’s body, you can finish takedown just like you would with a single leg takedown. This is less common with the standard ankle pick and more common when you execute the cross variation (see David Taylor below).
Examples of Ankle Pick From Wrestling Greats
Cael Sanderson is known for his ankle pick. A 4-time NCAA champion, Cael Sanderson is the only American wrestler to go undefeated in his collegiate wrestling career. All of his opponents knew that he had an ankle pick but ultimately, none of them were able to stop it. That is true mastery. At the 2004 Olympic games in freestyle wrestling, Cael Sanderson won the Olympic gold medal. In the semifinals of that tournament, he beat eventual UFC superstar Yoel Romero, who competed in freestyle wrestling for Cuba at the time.
David Taylor is a rising star on the international freestyle wrestling circuit having won the World Cup and the prestigious Ivan Yarygin tournament in Russia. Unsurprisingly, he was coached by Cael Sanderson at Penn State University, where he was a 2-time NCAA champion. In his collegiate career, he only lost three wrestling matches. David Taylor hits the cross  variation. While Cael Sanderson dropped to his left knee for his ankle picks, David Taylor drops to his right knee. Both variations are effective but as you will see, the set ups and finishes are slightly different. However, the principles behind the technique are the same.
Elbrus Tedeev, like Cael Sanderson, was an Olympic gold medalist in freestyle wrestling in the 2004 Olympic games. Instead of using a collar tie variation , he uses elbow control instead.

Mastering Takedowns: How to Defend a Headlock
A wrestling headlock catches a lot of wrestlers off guard. Let’s learn how a wrestler can defend a headlock.
I have witnessed numerous veteran wrestlers get thrown in a wrestling headlock.
In my opinion, a wrestler should never get thrown in a headlock after he was wrestled for a couple of years.
No Wrestler should go looking for Headlocks
Any decent wrestler knows how to defend a headlock. I have seen kids that were extremely good at headlocks, but most wrestlers should not be looking for a headlock.
A headlock is a move that young wrestlers use. You see a lot of headlocks in heavyweight wrestling. The only time an older wrestler should use a headlock is if it is blatantly given to him by his opponent or if a wrestler is behind and needs a home run to win a wrestling match
The Pitfalls of Head Hunting
In the world of wrestling, the headlock has long been considered a fundamental move, especially among younger athletes. While it may be tempting to rely on this technique, seasoned wrestlers understand the importance of restraint and strategic thinking in utilizing the headlock. In this article, we delve into the reasons why wrestlers, regardless of their skill level, should exercise caution when considering the headlock as their go-to move.
It’s undeniable that the headlock holds a certain allure, particularly for novice wrestlers. It’s a move that’s relatively easy to learn, and its execution appears straightforward. However, the reality is that any decent wrestler can adeptly defend against a headlock, rendering it less effective than one might initially think.
Young wrestlers often find themselves drawn to the headlock, showcasing their enthusiasm and eagerness to engage in the sport. It’s a move commonly witnessed in the heavyweight division, where raw power and physicality can sometimes overshadow strategic finesse. However, as wrestlers progress in their skill levels, a critical shift in approach becomes necessary.
For most wrestlers, relying on the headlock as a primary move is ill-advised. The move’s limitations become apparent as opponents become more seasoned and skillful. As the level of competition increases, the headlock transforms from a reliable technique to a risky gamble that could leave a wrestler vulnerable to counterattacks.
While younger wrestlers may experiment with the headlock as part of their learning process, it’s crucial for older, more experienced athletes to exercise discretion. Utilizing a headlock should be a deliberate decision, reserved for specific scenarios where its use is justified. Older wrestlers should be cautious not to fall into the trap of over-relying on a move that becomes increasingly less effective against skilled opponents.
One of the critical aspects of wrestling is strategic timing. A headlock should only be employed when the opportunity is unmistakably presented by the opponent. Wrestlers should resist the urge to force a headlock in situations where it isn’t naturally available. Instead, focus on honing a diverse set of techniques to maintain adaptability and keep opponents guessing.
For older wrestlers, the headlock should be viewed as a last resort—a move to be employed when circumstances demand a bold, decisive action. Whether a wrestler finds themselves behind on points or facing a particularly challenging opponent, the headlock can serve as a potential game-changer. However, it should not be the default option but rather a strategic choice made with careful consideration.
In the complex and dynamic world of wrestling, a well-rounded skill set is essential for success. Wrestlers, regardless of their experience level, should recognize the limitations of the headlock and avoid the temptation of head hunting. By embracing a strategic and adaptable approach, athletes can navigate the mat with confidence, minimizing risks and maximizing their chances of victory.
Wrestlers Should NEVER be thrown from a Headlock
A wrestler should be learning how to defend a headlock in their first or second year of wrestling.
Learning how to defend a headlock is key to learning how to be a good wrestler.
Defending a headlock should be entrenched in a wrestler so he doesn’t even think about it. As soon as he feels his opponent grabbing this head, he should automatically go into defense mode.
Wrestling Coaches – Teach Headlock Defense Often
If you are a wrestling coach, you should teach your wrestlers how to defend a headlock as soon as you see one of your wrestlers get thrown with a headlock.
In fact, I would recommend adding headlock defense into your chain wrestling drills.
Having your wrestlers do situation drills where they defend a headlock will help them when they see headlocks in a real match.

These locks can be executed from a variety of positions, such as from the top or bottom of a wrestling match.While these locks can be effective in gaining an advantage in wrestling matches, they should be used with caution, as they can also cause injury if executed improperly.

Let's dive in!
What this article covers:
Defending Against the Armbar:
The armbar is a commonly used grappling technique where one wrestler seeks to immobilize and potentially submit their opponent by applying pressure to their arm joint. To effectively defend against an armbar, it is crucial to react swiftly and maintain good positioning. Here's a step-by-step guide to defending against an armbar:1. Recognize the threat: Be attentive to your opponent's movements and anticipate the armbar attempt. Staying vigilant will enable you to react in a timely manner.2. Hand and wrist control: As soon as you sense the armbar coming, grab your own wrist with your free hand to secure control over your arm. This prevents your opponent from fully extending it.3. Protect your arm: Bend your trapped arm at the elbow to create a stronger, more stable joint. Keep your arm tight to your body to minimize your opponent's leverage.4. Maintain posture: Arch your back and engage your core to create resistance against the armbar. This position makes it harder for your opponent to secure a solid grip and apply pressure.5. Counterattack opportunities: Look for openings to escape the armbar by using your legs or by transitioning into a reversal or counter-submission move.

The Gut Wrench in Wrestling:
The gut wrench is a powerful technique used in wrestling to gain control over an opponent from the top position. Here's how to execute the gut wrench:1. Secure the position: Start by gaining control over your opponent's upper body, wrapping your arms tightly around their waist.2. Apply pressure: With a firm grip, drive your shoulder into your opponent's midsection, initiating a twisting motion while maintaining control over their waist.3. Create leverage: Utilize your leg and hip movement to generate rotational force, effectively wrenching your opponent's midsection and destabilizing their base.4. Maintain control: Continue applying pressure and adjusting your grip as needed to prevent your opponent from escaping or countering.
The Frog Splash in Wrestling:
The frog splash is an impactful aerial maneuver commonly seen in professional wrestling. While its execution varies, here's a general outline of how to perform a frog splash:1. Positioning: Climb to the top turnbuckle, facing the ring.2. Assess the situation: Identify your target by observing the positioning of your opponent(s) in the ring.3. Leap into action: Jump high off the turnbuckle, extending your body horizontally or diagonally.4. Body control: As you descend, tuck your knees towards your chest and position your arms close to your body for stability.5. Impact: Unleash the splash, landing with precision on your opponent's chest or abdomen, using your momentum to maximize the impact.
Technical Falls in Wrestling:
A technical fall is an alternative way to secure victory in a wrestling match. It occurs when a wrestler accumulates a significant lead, typically by outscoring their opponent by a predetermined margin. In most cases, a technical fall results in an immediate victory, showcasing the superior performance and skill of the winning wrestler.
Snapdowns for Strategic Advantage:
Snapdowns are effective techniques used to control an opponent's posture, create openings, and set up scoring opportunities. Here's how to execute a snapdown:1.Hand fighting: Engage in hand-to-hand combat with your opponent, striving to control their wrists and arms.2. Seize the opportunity: When your opponent's posture becomes vulnerable, snap their head down forcefully by pulling their neck or forehead downward. This action disrupts their balance and control.3. Capitalize on the opening: As your opponent's head drops, quickly transition into a favorable position, such as attacking their legs, executing a takedown, or maneuvering for back control.4. Maintain momentum: Stay aggressive after the snapdown, relentlessly pursuing additional scoring opportunities while exploiting the advantage gained from disrupting your opponent's balance.
The Abdominal Stretch Wrestling Move:
The abdominal stretch is a highly effective wrestling maneuver used to immobilize opponents and inflict pain. Here's how to execute the abdominal stretch:1. Gain control: From a standing position, wrap your arm around your opponent's waist, securing a tight grip. Simultaneously, use your other arm to hook their leg from the inside.2. Twist and stretch: Pull your opponent toward you while applying pressure to their midsection. Lean back, using your grip and leverage to generate tension and pain in their abdomen and lower back.3. Maintain control: Use your leg hook to restrict your opponent's movement, making it difficult for them to escape or counterattack.4. Endgame: Continue exerting pressure on your opponent's midsection while assessing opportunities to transition into another move or secure a pinfall.
Conclusion:
Defending against the armbar and mastering a range of wrestling techniques are vital for success on the mat. By understanding the intricacies of defending against the armbar, implementing the gut wrench, executing the frog splash, recognizing technical falls, utilizing snapdowns, and applying the abdominal stretch, you'll have a well-rounded arsenal to dominate your opponents. Practice these techniques diligently, seek guidance from experienced coaches, and never stop refining your skills. Embrace the journey of improvement, and enjoy the thrill of victory in the world of wrestling.

BJJ Techniques

Known as the cross armlock in Judo, or ude hishigi juji gatame; this hyperextension of the elbow joint, when applied correctly, requires controlled force and full-body leverage to apply and secure the lock; as well as preventing the opponent from escaping.
Known as a traditional submission, in jiu jitsu, and not to be confused with the general term ‘armlock,’ the armbar is a very specific movement that is easily identifiable.
The jiu jitsu practitioner has the opponents arm, generally at the wrist, secured between their legs.
The practitioner will have one of their legs across the opponent’s chest and the other across the opponents face while squeezing their own knees together.
With the thumb facing up, the bjj practitioner holds the opponent’s arm to their chest, making sure that the opponent’s elbow joint is lying across their hips.
When the arm is secured, the bjj practitioner can apply pressure to the elbow joint by arching their hips against or towards the elbow.
The pressure from the hips moving one way, and the trapped limb being pulled by the practitioner’s torso another, causes the joint to break or the opponent to tap out.
History
You have to go back to ancient Greece to see artwork and historical references to submissions. Although Grappling has existed for thousands of years, going as far back as 15000 BC, it wasn’t until the ancient Greeks came along that we began to see submission holds incorporated into grappling.
With their wrestling and pankration (meaning all-force), the Greeks applied and recorded submissions such as armlocks and chokes.
Unfortunately, not much imagery on the technical aspects of the submissions has survived.
The Armbar in BJJ
With regards to BJJ, the armbar has had a prominent role as a submission of choice for many practitioners, including Carlos Gracie Sr.
The armbar was so effective that it became extremely popular around this time.
The closed guard to armbar setup became widely utilised in the jiu-jitsu world. Being applied from the bottom postition, the armbar setup from bottom became a saviour submission for any practitioners who frequently ended up on their back, or those who favoured a defensive, reactive style.
It is perhaps noteworthy that the armbar, although popular from top position, became most popular in the early days from a bottom position.
The armbar, instead, isolates an upper limb, and even the largest attacker cannot defend a single-arm against the technique of a trained individual who can utilise their full-body against it.
How to do an Armbar aka Juji Gatame
Armbar From Mount
In this position, we’re going to look at an armbar submission from mount. The armbar from mount or Jiji Gatame, is a classic attacking position in Jiu-Jitsu and BJJ.
However, it is also a position that is lost easily as the opponent’s arm escapes an elbow during the armbar attack.
The armbar is best caught when it is done slowly and methodically, it is also a lot tighter as a submission.
Arm Bar Variations
Now let’s look at various armbar submissions and different ways we can attack the shoulder lock and arm lock.
Armbar From Guard
We’re now going to look at the second most common position for getting and armbar in BJJ from the guard.
The armbar from this position really is one of those beginner bread and butter techniques that every Jiu-Jitsu practitioner should be practising.
However the mechanics of it can confuse some people, including myself when I first started to learn it, but let’s break it down into it’s fundamental movement pivot, the hips.
Like many other moves in jiu jitsu the hips are key when it comes to getting a clean, tight armbar from guard, the more fluid you are with your hips, the easier the catch.
Let’s take a look at how to perform an armbar from this position
Belly Down Armlock
The belly-down armbar in BJJ is often caught from your opponent turtling or from a transition during the armbar from the bottom where you rotate your body further than 90 degrees past their hip line.
The belly-down armbar is a bit of a last-ditch move, something that should be attempted if you’re down on points and desperate for these submissions against a dying timer.
Straight Armbar
The straight armbar is a variation on the armbar, where instead of using your hips as the fulcrum to cause the hyper-extension, you use another limb. Normally your own arm.
Here we talk about performing straight armbar techniques from guard.
Flying Armbar
The flying armbar is one of the most spectacular moves in mixed martial arts and BJJ. If the technique is performed correctly, it’s an instant tap and submission.
Helicopter Armbar
The helicopter is a flashy move that was first introduced by BJJ black belt Braulio Estima. Used correctly, it allows you to surprise your opponent with a fantastically quick submission.
This is an advanced technique, so before performing this, you should already know how to perform a standard armbar from mount as the finish is identical.

Remember, consistent practice, dedication, and learning from each match are key to becoming a formidable arm wrestler. ← Previous Post.","How to Get Better at Arm Wrestling: Mastering Key Techniques
Discover essential techniques to improve your arm wrestling skills with our comprehensive guide. Learn about Rising, Cupping, Wrist Cupping, Pronation, Belt Grip, and Strength Training to dominate your arm wrestling matches. Perfect for beginners and seasoned competitors alike
Here’s a list of key techniques how to get better at arm wrestling.
Rising
The Rising technique in arm wrestling is a strategic move that focuses on lifting your opponent’s hand upwards to gain leverage. This technique is not just about physical strength; it’s about understanding the mechanics of leverage and using it to your advantage.
Rising works by targeting the weakest point in your opponent’s grip – typically the fingers or the wrist. By lifting their hand upwards, you disrupt their stable position, making it harder for them to apply force effectively. This move shifts the battle from sheer force to a more strategic manipulation of leverage.
The key to rising is in the wrist and fingers. The action involves a combination of wrist flexion and finger extension. By flexing your wrist upwards while extending your fingers, you create an upward force on your opponent’s grip. This movement requires strength in the forearm and flexibility in the wrist.
To effectively implement rising in a match:
To train for rising, focus on exercises that strengthen your wrists and forearms. Wrist curls, reverse wrist curls, and finger extensions are great exercises. Additionally, practicing the rising movement with a partner or using an arm wrestling table can help develop the specific muscles and techniques needed.
Cupping: Securing a Strong Grip
Cupping is a fundamental technique in arm wrestling that involves curling your hand towards your wrist. This move is essential for establishing and maintaining a strong, controlling grip on your opponent’s hand. Mastering cupping can significantly enhance your arm wrestling prowess by allowing you to dictate the flow of the match.
Cupping centers around the concept of reducing your opponent’s leverage while maximizing your own. By curling your fingers and thumb towards your wrist, you effectively ‘cup’ your hand, creating a concave shape. This action tightens your grip and limits your opponent’s ability to maneuver or escape.
To successfully implement cupping:
To train for this technique, focus on exercises that strengthen your forearm flexors and enhance your grip strength. Activities such as wrist curls, finger curls, and grip strength trainers are beneficial. Additionally, practicing the cupping motion during sparring sessions can help in developing muscle memory and technique refinement.
Wrist Cupping: A Twist on Traditional Cupping
Wrist cupping is an advanced arm wrestling technique that builds upon the basic cupping move by adding a twist to the wrist. This nuanced approach not only enhances grip strength but also introduces an element of control that can be pivotal in a match. Understanding and mastering wrist cupping can give arm wrestlers an edge, especially in challenging bouts.
The technique starts with the basic cupping motion – curling your hand towards your wrist. Once this grip is established, you then add a twisting motion. This rotation typically involves turning your wrist inwards, towards your body. This movement not only strengthens your grip but also disrupts your opponent’s alignment and leverage.
To effectively use wrist cupping in a match:
Developing proficiency in wrist cupping requires specific training focused on wrist flexibility and strength. Exercises like wrist curls with a twist, pronation and supination movements with weights, and grip strengthening exercises are particularly effective. Practice the combined cupping and twisting motion regularly to build muscle memory.
Wrist cupping offers a strategic advantage by providing a more secure grip and disrupting the opponent’s strategy. It can be particularly effective against opponents who rely heavily on their wrist strength or those who use techniques like top-rolling. Mastering wrist cupping can be a game-changer, especially in high-stakes matches where every little advantage counts.
Pronation: The Art of Twisting
Pronation in arm wrestling is a critical technique where you rotate your arm to make your palm face downwards. This movement is particularly effective for countering your opponent’s grip and can play a pivotal role in gaining the upper hand in a match. Mastering pronation can greatly enhance your arm wrestling abilities, providing a strategic advantage over opponents.
Pronation involves rotating the forearm so that the palm turns to face down. This move is crucial in arm wrestling as it can weaken your opponent’s grip and reduce their leverage. By pronating your arm, you apply a twisting force that can disrupt your opponent’s position and strategy, making it difficult for them to maintain a strong hold.
To successfully use pronation in a match:
Pronation in arm wrestling is a critical technique where you rotate your arm to make your palm face downwards. This movement is particularly effective for countering your opponent’s grip and can play a pivotal role in gaining the upper hand in a match. Mastering pronation can greatly enhance your arm wrestling abilities, providing a strategic advantage over opponents.
Pronation offers a strategic edge in arm wrestling by allowing you to counter various grip techniques and styles. It’s especially useful against opponents who rely on techniques like the top roll or hook. Effective pronation can shift the dynamics of a match, giving you the leverage to overpower your opponent.
Belt Grip
The Belt Grip is a lesser-known but highly effective technique in arm wrestling that involves utilizing your belt or waistband to gain additional stability and leverage during a match. This technique is particularly useful in situations where maintaining endurance and a steady position is crucial. Understanding and correctly implementing the Belt Grip can provide a significant advantage in arm wrestling competitions.
The Belt Grip technique is based on the principle of using your own body and clothing as leverage points. By gripping your belt or waistband with your non-wrestling hand, you create a point of stability that helps you anchor your body more effectively. This technique allows for better control over your movements and can help resist the force exerted by your opponent.
In arm wrestling, balance and stability are as important as strength. The Belt Grip aids in maintaining a balanced posture by providing an additional anchor point. By holding onto your belt or waistband, you can prevent your body from being easily moved or twisted by your opponent’s actions, thereby maintaining a more advantageous position.
To effectively use the Belt Grip:
While the Belt Grip doesn’t require specific physical training, it does require practice to master. Incorporating this technique into your practice sessions will help you get accustomed to the feel and benefits it offers. Focus on maintaining the grip throughout various movements and techniques to understand how it affects your overall performance.
The main advantage of the Belt Grip is the added stability and leverage it provides. This can be especially beneficial in lengthy matches where endurance plays a crucial role. It also offers a psychological edge, as maintaining a steady and controlled posture can be intimidating to opponents.
Strength
In the world of arm wrestling, strength training is more than just a routine; it’s a crucial component for achieving success. While techniques and strategies are vital, the role of physical strength, particularly in the forearms, biceps, and shoulders, cannot be overstated. A well-rounded strength training program can significantly enhance your arm wrestling capabilities.
Arm wrestling demands a unique combination of strength, endurance, and power. It’s a sport that tests the limits of your arm’s muscular capabilities. Strengthening the muscles in your forearm, biceps, and shoulders not only improves your ability to exert force but also enhances your resistance against your opponent’s moves.
Recovery is as crucial as the workout itself. Ensure you have adequate rest days and consider incorporating recovery techniques like stretching, massage, or foam rolling. Proper nutrition and hydration are also vital for muscle repair and growth.
Conclusion
Improving at arm wrestling requires a mix of technique, strategy, and physical strength. By mastering techniques like Rising, Cupping, Wrist Cupping, Pronation, and the Belt Grip, and by enhancing your overall strength, you can significantly improve your performance in this challenging sport. Remember, consistent practice, dedication, and learning from each match are key to becoming a formidable arm wrestler.

From the top though, you can react before they extend your arm, or afterward. Prying the legs open happens somewhere in the middle. This escape is actually really simple and very logical.","Armbar Defense 101: How To Escape From Top And Bottom
Home » BJJ Lifestyle » Beginners tips » Armbar Defense 101: How To Escape From Top And Bottom
Getting caught in armbars left and right? It is time to brush up on your armbar defense. Since there’s no better place to start than the fundamentals of defending and escaping armbars, that is exactly what we will go over today. Every great defense begins with understanding the move you’re defending against first. You then need to know the direction in which you’re moving, which in Jiu Jitsu always starts with defending and then moves towards escaping. Finally, we’ll go over four armbar defense and escape maneuvers that will give you the most bang for your buck!
Armbar Defense 101: What Should You Focus On?
Well, the first thing would be, not ending up with a broken arm. The only 100% armbar defense, (after you’re caught) is to tap out. That’s when your arm’s integrity is in question, of course. Since this tap is exactly what we want to avoid in BJJ, there are ways to get out of armbars, but only if you understand how they work first.
An armbar is a submission hold that targets the elbow joint. The hips of an opponent will push against your elbow, looking to force it in a direction it doesn’t anatomically bend to. At the same time, the opponent has to hold both your shoulder and your wrist tightly in place. If you manage to deny them any of these three things, you’ll be able to execute an armbar defense, and eventually, get out of the position to resume the roll or match.
In terms of armbar defense, the general principles of defensive BJJ apply again – you can escape early, or late, not in the middle. Early escapes mean you won’t allow people to ever get to the armbar position, which is outside the scope of this article. Late defenses, when you’ve been caught in an armbar are what we’re interested in here today. That means that your arm is either fully extended or very close to being extended. It just so happens, the best armbar defense and escape options present themselves at precisely those moments.
As I said before, the focus should be on either removing the pressure of ht hips from the elbow or releasing one endpoint of your arm (shoulder or wrist) so that you can get the arm out. These are the universal principles that will help you get out of both top and bottom position armbars, given that the mechanics of the submission are the same even though the positioning is vastly different.
4 Proven Ways Of Escaping Top And Bottom Position Armbars
In the interest of full disclosure, there are plenty of different ways you can setup armbar defense and escape tactics. The following four are the ones we chose because they’ve been proven to work over and over again at all levels of Jiu Jitsu. We’ll start with defending an armbar when the person attacking you is on the bottom, seeing as that is a position where you often might end up when executing armbar escapes against top position attacks.
The one main thing to remember when you’re practicing armbar defense is to be ready to tap at all times. Don’t practice escapes against people that will spaz and crank on your arms. Instead, carefully choose the partners that’ll help you figure out the finer details of the eclipses which you’ll then be able to apply against anyone, regardless of how fast or hard they come after your arms.
Escape #1  The Stack
First up, the one armbar situation you’re bound to find yourself in quite often – people attacking from the guard. The armbar from the bottom will only work if they have your shoulder and wrist, though. In most cases, it is the wrist that is more difficult to extract, given the setups for bottom position armbars. This is where the stack armbar defense comes into play.
The goal with it is simple – use the fact that your shoulder is unrestricted on one side to get the entire arm out. Before doing so, though, you’ll have to ensure your elbow is not in danger. Two main things help you accomplish it – first, grip the forearm of the arm under threat with your arm, bending the elbow as much as possible. Even the slightest bend will do the trick.
Secondly, you should aim to raise the opponent’s butt off the ground, and place a knee behind it. The aim is to wedge the hips off the ground so that there’s no pressure for your opponent to finish the armbar. That’s the defense part. For the escape, you simply wiggle your arm free, being vigilant not to turn your torso too much so that you open up triangle choke or Omoplata follow-ups.
Escape #2 Pry Open The Legs
This is my favorite armbar escape, mostly because it really pisses people off. It has to do with top position armbar defense, given that anytime a person is attacking from the bottom you simply revert to the stack defense. From the top though, you can react before they extend your arm, or afterward. Prying the legs open happens somewhere in the middle.
This escape is actually really simple and very logical. Lookign at armbar defense first, if you have your arms tied together, there’s no way for an opponent to finish a straight armbar. I recommend a palm to palm grip here because it actually gives you the range of motion to pry the legs open. The best positioning of your arms is like a frame, with the free arm’s elbow tight to your ribs.
This is the elbow that will help you lift the leg that’s over your chest. It acts an underhook really, creating just enough space to snake your leg around the opponent’s ankle. Once you have the legs open, it is easy to turn towards the opponent, getting your elbow to the ground. No more armbar!
Escape #3 The Hitchhiker Escape
The hitchhiker is a very popular armbar escape, but it does come with a certain dose of risk. That’s what makes it both attractive to perform and highly effective, though. I just have to caution you that you’ll tap out to plenty of armbars while learning it and perfecting the finer aspects of this armbar defense maneuver.
Whenever people attack an armbar from the top, they’ll be looking to use their entire body against your arm. This means that with the correct angle, you can actually use the position to escape. Given that the hitchhiker is a very late armbar escape, teh defense, and escape parts blend together in this one.
Once the arm is extended, you’ll have to use your legs to position your body as close to a straight line as possible in relation to your opponent. The extended arm acts as a pivot point, and turning it in place will get your body into place. The goal is to turn completely over on your belly, ending up on top with your arm safe from the submission threat.
Escape #4 Roll-over
The roll-over is probably the riskiest defense of them all, given that you’ll be using two modes of armbar defense to get out. It still does come in handy though. You can set it up from different grip positions when defending top position armbars, but the rear-naked choke grip configuration works best. That’s when you grip your free arm’s biceps with the arm being attacked. The palm of your free arm should grab the opponent’s triceps.
The maneuver will have you position your legs and hips to the outside, as far as possible. This will provide you with momentum for executing the escape. For the roll-over, you’ll need to swing both your legs so that they’re as close to the opponent as possible. From there, you can bridge to them, using the momentum to swing the legs over into a roll and end up on top.
Note that you’ll end up in a stack defense situation most of the time, so be ready to apply it immediately after you roll, or the opponent might get shot at a bottom position armbar finish.
Conclusion
Armbar defense can e a tricky thing, especially when facing armbar specialists. If you ask me, late escapes are gar more effective at beating top-level opponents than any of the other ones, but whatever works for you – use it. An interesting thing about the four different escape options above is that you can connect them together, virtually ensuring you’ll be able to mount the best possible defense against most armbars. Still, you’ll end up tapping to a few armbars here and there in your career. It’s the BJJ life.

Kimura Lock
The kimura lock, also called double wristlock (catch wrestling), chicken wing or gyaku ude-garami (judo) is a grappling submission hold of uncertain origin, being catch wrestling and judo the likely authors of the position. In Brazilian jiu-jitsu the submission bears the name of “Kimura” after the famous athlete Masahiko Kimura who defeated Helio Gracie with this joint-lock in a legendary match for combat sports, which took place on October 23, 1951. The submission relies on isolating the shoulder and elbow joints with the use of a double wrist grip which allows for the attacker to apply leverage against both of these joints (though mainly the shoulder).
The Kimura Lock History
Although similar positions to the kimura lock are seen in old German shoot fighting manuals dating as back as 1520, or even in the Khmer temple, Cambodia (12th century). In catch wrestling, the creation of the double wristlock is often attributed to Lorigo Morelli (also known as “Tony” Morelli) during the 1920’s. The lock was also utilized in freestyle wrestling, being Robin Reed one of the most decorated spreaders of the position, having paved the way to a gold medal at the 1924 Paris Summer Olympics with several pins performed with the use of the double wristlock.
In Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the position became highly popular due to Masahiko Kimura, the judoka who defeated Helio Gracie in a grappling match, by way of gyaku ude-garami, the lock that now bears his name in the jiu-jitsu circuit.
After the defeat of Japan in World War II, the United States led the ally forces in the occupation and rehabilitation of the Japanese state. This occupation enacted widespread military, political, economic, and social reforms, one of these reforms had judo banned from the Japanese school system. This was a major blow to many judoka who had a steady income teaching the sport, among these unfortunate judokas was Masahiko Kimura.
Born in September 1917, Masahiko Kimura was the best judoka of his generation, but with the aforementioned judo ban, he decided to sign up to an international entertainment company that toured around the world showcasing judo athletes in a series of demonstration matches. The tour led Kimura to a professional wrestling promoter named Aru Karashiko, it was through professional wrestling that Kimura entered Brazil, contracted to tour the South American country and perform on stage a series of pro-wrestling matches.
When Carlos and Helio Gracie found that Kimura was in Brazil, they immediately challenged the legendary Japanese to a grappling match against Helio. Kimura refused the offer, failing to recognize the legitimacy of Helio Gracie. To test the Gracie family’s credibility on the mat, they organized a super fight against another apt Japanese who toured with Kimura, Yukio Kato, who was 22 years old and weighed around 70kg (154lbs), a similar weight to Helio’s.
The iconic Gracie fought Kato twice, the first match being a draw and the second a submission win to Helio Gracie. The win forced Kimura to accept the challenge, and the fight was set for Rio de Janeiro on October 23, 1951, in what would be a three 10 minute round fight.
There are certain myths surrounding the clash between Kimura and Helio Gracie, many of these spread by the Gracie advertising strategy who used this bout to boost the profile of their fighting style. The first being that Kimura had mentioned that he would consider the match a loss if Helio lasted more than 3 minutes with him. We could not find a record of these words being mentioned by the Japanese, in any of the media and in fact, according to Kimura’s statements, he used the first 10 minute round of the match to test Helio’s skills, finishing him early in the 2nd round.
Another myth is that there was a 36kg (80lbs) weight difference between the two fighters. The match had no weight limit and none of the fighters were weighed in. Kimura was certainly the heavier of the two, and although we can only speculate, the weight difference was more likely closer to a 10kg/22lbs considering both fighters weights from previous matches.
Helio saw this match as a retirement fight, he was 39 years old (Kimura was 34). He was quoted after the bout saying that he knew he had very few chances to win against the famous Japanese, but he saw it as a chance to test his skill. He would return from his retirement in 1954 and again in 1955.
The Kimura Trap System was developed by David Avellan in 2012. It is a submission system designed to utilize the kimura lock from every position possible in combat, with many transitions, sweeps, passes, submissions, takedowns, and takedown counters. While techniques in this system have been used before in a stand-alone fashion, what is novel about this approach is how they have been all combined and designed to flow from one technique to the next in a easy to learn system.
The term Kimura Trap is now used to describe attacking with the kimura lock WITHOUT using it for a submission finish. Rather, the kimura Lock is used as a powerful control position to transition into other submissions, guard passes or sweeps.
The kimura lock has been one of the most popular submissions in the sport since it’s creation, especially in the no-gi aspect of jiu-jitsu, being associated with a variety of transitions, from back takes to chokes and armbars.

Few submissions are as versatile as the kimura lock in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Its uses from the bottom, top, and side make it very common at levels, and it’s a favorite tool of creative grapplers in the form of the kimura trap system.
Also known as the double wrist lock, the kimura lock is a shoulder lock submission hold utilizing a figure four grip on the opponent’s wrist. This grip allows control over the forearm and elbow and the ability to place a lot of rotational power on the shoulder, forcing a submission. The powerful grip is also commonly used to control and advance positions.
Many details go into the kimura and its use in all positions. The sheer versatility and popularity of the kimura make it a mandatory addition to every BJJ player’s repertoire.
How To Apply A Kimura Lock
With the history lesson out of the way, let’s look at how to execute and finish the kimura lock.
As I’ve said, you can do the kimura in multiple positions, and we will look at a few of them, starting from the most common- the full guard.
From Full Guard
From Side Control
Kumuras are very common from side control because isolating the arm you want to attack is much easier. The first part of the submission is grabbing hold of the figure-four grip on the wrist.
There are multiple ways to set this up. You will need to assume north-side control, but this can be done before you have the grip or after, with most people doing it after holding the wrist.
Once you have the grip, you need to place the shoulder under extreme tension, which is not as simple as it looks because the shoulder is a very mobile joint. One of your legs must be behind his back, preventing him from getting a better posture and immobilizing the neck.
The full mount is another excellent position offering a few ways to finish a kimura:
Standing Kimuras also exist but are a bit more complicated to do. Nevertheless, fighters like Kazushi Sakuraba manage to specialize in it. Sakuraba’s mastery of the kimura as a whole deserves detailed study:
The most important principle for finishing a kimura is getting the right angles. The shoulder is very mobile, and enough pressure can be applied only if the angle is correct. This is true for almost everything in jiu-jitsu, but for this submission is even more significant.
Defending and Escaping the Kimura
To know how to defend any submission, you must know the dangers and mechanics. We already covered how the kimura targets the shoulder by immobilizing the elbow and neck. The power for the finish comes from the rotational power applied to the bent arm behind the back.
The main principle for defending kimura locks is not to let your hands go behind your back by rotating toward the endangered arm. Since the kimura is so popular, it’s good to have a few reliable defenses against the common attack positions, namely guard and side control.
If you are in full guard, you first need to ensure not to let your hands go to the mat because this is where the opponent will attack. This is, of course, not always possible, so you must familiarize yourself with the few possible defenses. Here are some of them:
Not only can you get out of a kimura, but you can also use the situation to your advantage with a counter kimura. This is especially nasty because the opponent cannot even let go of his own grip, which got him in the bad spot.
What Is A Kimura Lock
The kimura lock is one of the most versatile submission moves, and one of the first every BJJ student learns. Its mechanics work by isolating the elbow and shoulder joints through a figure-four grip on the wrist.
This is done by grabbing the opponent’s wrist with one hand and your own wrist from behind his triceps. The kimura aims at the shoulder, meaning you must control the two neighboring joints, the elbow, and neck, following the core principles of all joint locks.
The figure four grip gives you complete control over his elbow. If you isolate the neck, you can place a lot of rotational force on the shoulder, leading to a tap or serious damage.
Control over the neck depends on the position you are in. For instance, this can be the legs in side control or the ground in full guard.
A successful kimura lock can heavily damage your shoulder, and this is not something you can brush off easily. Even if the degree of injury is not so severe, not tapping in time to a kimura may lead to nagging problems and weeks off the mats.
There are also many well-documented instances of broken arms, so be aware of the point of no return when you defend against kimuras.
What makes the kimura so popular is its amazing versatility and utility. First, it can be applied as a submission from closed guard, mount, side control, or standing.
Finishing the kimura is tricky, but the control over the forearm and elbow makes the double wrist lock grip very good for flowing between positions. This is commonly known as the kimura trap system.
History Of The Kimura
The Kimura lock is a popular submission hold in many grappling martial arts. It’s known as gyaku ude-garami in Judo and the double wrist lock in catch wrestling. The move was named Kimura in Jiu-Jitsu after the famous Judoka Masahiko Kimura.
Masahiko Kimura was considered the best Judoka on the planet, and in 1951 he was in Brazil to hold demonstrations and grapple in challenge matches. Helio Gracie found out he was there and challenged the Judoka.
Kimura first refused and instead proposed that Gracie fight the second-best judo player, Yukio Kato. After Helio went to a draw with Kato the first time they met, he managed to strangle him in the second, and Kimura had no choice but to accept the challenge.
The legendary match was held in front of 20,000 spectators at the Maracana stadium. The Judoka was much heavier and stronger but couldn’t finish Gracie up until, in the second round, he caught the shoulder lock and broke Helio Gracie’s arm.
The Brazilian refused to surrender, but his brother threw in the towel to spare him further damage. The submission was named Kimura in honor of the great victory of the Japanese fighter.
The Kimura Trap System
As dangerous as the kimura lock is, it’s hard to finish due to the many possible defenses and counters. This led to the creation of the kimura trap system, which turns the double wrist grip into a full system of potential attacks and transitions.
The main point of the kimura trap is that once a grappler has his hand locked in the double wrist lock, he has no other options for movement but to go toward the threatened arm. You then use this predictability to transition to other dominant positions or submissions.
A key detail to being good with the kimura trap is having a secure grip. Initially, you would want to grab the wrist with the thumb, but once you have both hands in place, transition into a no-thumb grip, also called the monkey grip. This grip provides much more power and control.
After you get the figure four nice and tight, you can go for the finish of the kimura, but most people are more than capable of defending, which is where you can spring the kimura trap. Using the grip, you can transition into different positions, scoring points with sweeps and back takes and threatening with other submissions.
Here is a full overview of the possibilities and options in the kimura trap system:
Can The Kimura Lock Break The Arm?
The kimura lock can break an arm; there are countless instances of this in BJJ and MMA. The damage is done to the humerus, the bone between the shoulder and elbow joints.
Usually, a kimura targets the shoulder ligaments and muscles, and most pain is felt there. Sprains to the ligaments and joint capsule are also the most common injuries resulting from kimura locks.
But it is possible to break the humerus with a kimura, an extremely nasty injury requiring surgery. This has happened many times in jiu-jitsu matches and MMA fights, so if you feel you can’t get out, tap as quickly as possible.
There is absolutely no reason to satisfy your ego and suffer damage that would require surgical procedures and months of recovery.
Here are a couple of graphic examples to remind you what the dangers of a kimura are:
Summary
The Kimura, or the double wrist lock, is an extremely powerful move part of most submission-based grappling martial arts arsenal. As such, you will become familiar with it from the first days you spend on the mats. It is a submission hold, a means to sweep or transition into other submissions.
The number of positions and variations means you can never be fully prepared for every possible scenario. Still, knowing how to use it to your advantage, how to escape control and negate the power of the grip, you will spare yourself a few taps and earn a few along the way.

All The Details You Need To Know About The Kimura lock
The Kimura grip is one of the most powerful controls, submissions and arguably positions that is used in both BJJ and MMA. The Kimura is consistently one of the most common ways to dominate a grappling match and has a long and illustrious history. In catch wrestling, it is known as the double wrist lock due to its British background. However, it also featured heavily in traditional judo, Japanese jiu-jitsu and of course BJJ.
Table of Contents
History & Origins Of The Kimura
The Kimura lock first gained attention from legendary judoka, Masahiko Kimura. Kimura was known for his high-level Judo and wrestling which lead to an eventual super fight against Helio Gracie. During this fight Kimura managed to apply the lock and break the shoulder of Helio resulting in victory. Since this epic match, the lock was named after him in BJJ and is commonly known as the Kimura even to this day.
Before this the kimura was heavily featured in British catch wrestling where it was known as the double wrist lock. Billy Robinson taught this move to the likes of Josh Barnett and later Sakuraba who featured it heavily in his style.In more modern times, it is associated with MMA fighter Kazushi Sakuraba who used this successfully on multiple opponents. In fact, he Kimura’d both Royler and Renzo Gracie during the Pride MMA days. The Kimura lock on Renzo resulted in his elbow breaking and the match being declared a victory as a result.
Not only this, but Sakuraba would be one of the first fighters to use the kimura grip as more of a position than a submission. He knew that even if he had what looked to be a worse position than his opponent. If he had a fully secured kimura grip he could always find his way back to the top.
Whilst there is no proof of the kimura being used, due to the martial art being over 2000 years old. Pankration most likely used the kimura from various positions. So it is unclear where the kimura first came from, but humans have been grappling in this way for centuries.
The Kimura can be used in real life the same way it is used in BJJ. This means from top, pinning positions or whilst on your back. However, many police forces are taught the Kimura and hammer-lock techniques. This relies on achieving the Kimura from the standing position to control the opponent. Although this is possible and does happen, it is far easier to use the Kimura whilst on the floor. The mechanics of a standing opponent often mean that it’s difficult to access their arm.
Both submissions have similarities and fall under the ‘keylock’ family. However, there are also a few key differences. The Americana works by placing your hand on the wrist and your arm under the elbow. The Kimura has the same wrist control but with your arm under the shoulder.
This means two things: Firstly, the Americana is often an elbow lock whilst the Kimura is mostly a shoulder lock.
Secondly, the Kimura can be used from various positions. As the Americana holds the elbow, it requires the arm to be pinned. Because of this, it is mostly used from side control and mount. However, the Kimura is far more versatile as it attacks the shoulder. This means it can be used from practically any position. From the top and bottom or even with your back taken, the Kimura can be used far more than the Americana.
Mechanics of the Kimura
The Kimura is started when the practitioner grabs the wrist of their opponent with the same side arm. The other arm is then wrapped around the back of the opponent’s shoulder and connected with your own wrist. This creates a 2 vs 1 scenario, where the attacker has a numbers advantage.
When the grip is secured; you are able to create an angle against the opponent, almost as if you are looking in their ear (same side as the attacked arm). Once a good angle is obtained, it will be a lot easier to finish the submission by bringing the opponent’s trapped arm towards the back of their own head.
This in turn creates great pressure on the opponent’s shoulder and can result in dislocation. Because of this, it is wise to tap early to the Kimura, as otherwise it can completely destroy the shoulder and result in a substantial injury. Because of this, the Kimura can quite easily break the arm.To make the Kimura more efficient there are some intricacies to add. One example is twisting your wrists down whilst applying the finish. This creates a tighter hold on the opponent’s arm and makes it harder to escape. Similarly, it is best to stay tight to the opponent’s body whilst finishing the hold and being heavy on their shoulder. This creates more tension and uses less energy, as the technique creates more leverage to enhance the submission.
Entries & Positions
Side Control
The Kimura is versatile and can be applied from both top and bottom positions. For instance, in top side control if the Kimura grip is obtained then you can step over the head of the opponent to finish. This means the opponent cannot escape or lift their head to alleviate pressure. Once here, the same finish as mentioned above can be applied. This requires bending the arm and shoulder behind the opponents back.
Half Guard
From the bottom, there is the Kimura trap from half guard. This involves baiting the opponent into putting their far arm forward. From here, you can get the 2 vs 1 grip and isolate the arm. Again, the finish of the Kimura is the same from the top. Simply create an angle and pull the wrist towards the head to generate the finish.
Note that the kimura can also be finished from the top of half guard if the opponent has the grip. Lastly, the kimura can also be reversed from top if the opponents grip is too shallow on the shoulder. The top player can simply connect their hands together and rip the bottom players shoulder upwards.
Closed Guard & Mount
Closed guard is perhaps the safest method to attempt a kimura as you really don’t risk much even if you completely lose your grip and fail.
If you aren’t able to finish the submission in closed guad for whatever reason you can sweep to the side of the trapped shoulder as there is no base.
The kimura is rarely seen from mount, but can be finished from there. Remember that mount is just an inverted closed guard. You will need to make space between your opponents shoulder and the mat to finish. But it is still an exceptionally strong grip from this position.
Rolling Kimura
The rolling Kimura is also a key feature in modern BJJ.
Against a seated opponent from standing, it is possible to grab the Kimura grip and then perform a fowards roll. After the roll is complete, the next step involves doing an inverted roll to get to the opponents back or top side control, depending on their reaction.
It is most commonly used when standing in DLR guard since you already have a leg entanglement needed to maintain control. The position is not often used in points competitions, since you are essentially sweeping yourself to go for a submission which may not be successful.
When The Opponent Has Your Back
Thee Kimura grip is seen as extremely powerful as it’s own position and can also be used to sweep opponents and counter back takes. A classic example of the Kimura used as a position was by Sakuraba. Here he would bait the grip from bottom turtle or by giving his back and then use it to reverse the position.
The key detail is to always make sure the opponents elbow is trapped inside your own arm, otherwise this is not a true kimura grip and your opponent will be in the dominant position.
How do you get out of a Kimura?
Escaping the Kimura is not easy and means you’re in trouble. However, there are a few methods of escape. One method is to drop your weight onto your shoulder and collapse your body. This brings your torso closer to your shoulder which makes it harder to isolate the arm. If the opponent can’t isolate the arm, then the Kimura is made far harder.
From here, you then want to connect your other hand to the hand that is in danger. By connecting both hands, you should be able free your arm by pulling it away from the lock. The issue with the Kimura is that it’s a 2 vs 1 situation. However, by adding your own arm, it becomes 2 vs 2 in terms of limbs. This means finishing the Kimura becomes less likely. The kimura is easier to defend when wearing a gi, as there is always material to grip. If you’re just wearing a rashguard then it is significantly more difficult to hold on.
Summary
The Kimura is undoubtedly one of the best grips in all of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It can be used from almost any position and can be used for both sweeps and submissions. Not only this but the grip can also be used to get to the back of the opponent, or even set up alternative submissions such as armbars. Compared to the armbar, the Kimura is arguably a safer submission to attack too. This is because the opponent cannot escape into a potentially advantageous position if it fails.
It has been used for centuries by many and is fundamentally important in all areas of grappling.

Grappling
The Kimura is an arm & shoulder lock. The technique is also known as a Double Wrist lock in Catch Wrestling or gyaku ude-garami in Judo. In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the submission is known as the Kimura, after Masahiko Kimura, who used the submission to win a grappling match with Helio Gracie in Brazil in 1951.
The Kimura is another pervasive technique throughout grappling arts and can be used from a wide range of positions and in numerous contexts. Find yourself on top? You can find a Kimura. Wrestling? You can find a Kimura. On the bottom? You can find a Kimura!
Mechanically, the technique allows the practitioner to apply braking force to both the elbow and shoulder of their opponent. It’s an effective technique that finds a home in various places!
In this article, we’ll look at how it can be applied and how to apply it effectively.

How To Do a Kimura From Guard (Step By Step)
Step 1: Hands To The Mat
One of the best ways to set up your kimuras is to separate your opponent’s arms or put them on the mat. You can do this by swimming your arms from inside to outside. From here, target the arm you plan to apply the lock to. In this case, I will target his right arm (closest to the camera)
Step 2: Wrap The Arm
Taking my far arm, I reach up and over my uke’s shoulder, wrapping it. The aim here is that I can isolate his shoulder by tucking it under my arm. My hand will now reach back through from the backside to the front.
Step 3: Connect Your Hands
The Kimura works because I’m recruiting both of my arms versus one. Once my wrapping hand reaches through from the back side, it connects to the wrist of my front hand.
My front hand connects to the top of his wrist. This creates the ‘figure four’ arm configuration that the Kimura is so easily identified by.
Step 4: Turn And Apply Force
Now that my hands are connected, I can apply force to his arm and shoulder. I turn his hand back across behind his body. Notice how I’ve turned from my side to my back to help me recruit my posterior chain to apply force through his arm. From here, turn his arm until he taps!
Kimura Lock Defense (How To Escape)
Escaping a locked Kimura is a big challenge. However, you still have some options if your opponent locks one on.
5 Step Blueprint To Build A BJJ Strength Workout To Demolish Your Opposition
Learn how to plan your strength training to maximize transfer to the mats.
Your main priority should be to create distance between yourself and your opponent by posturing and “unwinding” the lock by moving through a plane of motion that relieves the pressure and allows your shoulder to free itself.
If your opponent has control of your hips, however, it will be extremely difficult for you to create the distance to unwind. As always, the best defense is being proactive and having the awareness to deny your opponent the position in the first place.
Kimura Lock Variations
From Side Control
Landing the kimura from side control differs from most of our variations because he has to relinquish control of the hips to create pressure through their arm and shoulder.
You must place your weight correctly, or you risk getting swept. Sprawl heavily towards your leg side of the opponent so that you don’t get turned over your shoulders as you try to apply the lock.
From Mount
From the mount, attempting the kimura without relinquishing the position is less than optimal. One alternative is to turn their arm supine and attack the Americana, a variation of the armlock.
This applies the same kind of pressure to the arm and shoulder without causing you to lose the mount position. Be aware that it doesn’t have the same control implications as the kimura, so there is still a risk of getting reversed here.
From Standing
The kimura can be used from standing as a move in itself or as a counter to their takedown when an opponent leaves an arm vulnerable.
Here’s one example of when we can use the kimura to reverse a takedown position, come out on top, and finish the submission.
This is a perfect example of when the kimura can be used to build control, maintain positional dominance, and create pathways for us to capitalize on a scramble or an opponent’s mistakes.
Frequently Asked Guillotine Choke Questions
Can The Kimura Lock Break The Arm?
Absolutely. The application of the Kimura provides us with the force to break the arm and dislocate the elbow & shoulder.
How Painful Is The Kimura Lock?
Pretty damn painful! Even the most flexible shoulders will only go so far before the pressure applied is either extremely painful or starts to cause damage.
What Happens If You Don’t Tap To A Kimura?
If you don’t tap into a Kimura, you risk injury to your elbow and shoulder. Dislocation of the elbow and shoulder can occur, but bone breaks are not uncommon either.
The radius and ulna are placed under a lot of pressure, the humerus is experiencing significant radial forces, and the shoulder is only held together by ligaments and tendons that can tear or snap.
Both elbow and shoulder joints are being placed under serious pressure and taken through a range of motion that is unnatural. Something will give, and it will not be good when it does!
Summary
To summarize, the Kimura is a highly effective joint lock with devastating potential when applied correctly. It’s not only used as a submission but also as a controlling technique, especially in no-gi jiu jitsu, where grips that allow you control over arm and shoulder are harder to come by.
It’s a versatile technique that can be applied in a wide range of positions. These are the kind of techniques we should aspire to refine, those which have the most utility in many scenarios.
Very rarely will a flashy technique you picked up on social media have the same level of application as the humble fundamentals- which are so often neglected.
Understand a technique’s potential in and of itself and its potential to broaden your game and open up further options through its application.

Guillotine Choke – Basics, Secrets and Variations to Make it Perfect
The guillotine choke has long been regarded as a strong man move. People involved in BJJ looked at it as just a one-off move useful mostly to MMA fighters. It was probably the emergence of Marcelo Garcia that started to change that impression. Marcelo managed to fine-tune and modify the guillotine to a deadly effect. That resulted in a greater awareness of the finer technical aspects of the choke. Today, guillotines can be seen in almost every competitive grappling environment done at every level of Jiu-Jitsu.
How many submissions do you know that you can get from both top and bottom positions as well as from standing? Arguably, there’s only one that ticks all these boxes. And it’s a tight one if the mechanics are in order. The guillotine choke is a mainstay in Jiu-Jitsu, granted, more on the No-GI side. It is, however, just as effective in the Gi. Actually, it might be even more effective, seeing how lots of people seem to disregard it on account of it being a No-Gi move. Check out Marcelo Garcia’s guillotine highlights to see how effective guillotines are.
What Is A Guillotine Choke?
The guillotine choke is a very versatile technique used in submission grappling arts, most of all, in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It works as a choke, blocking off air or blood supply by pressuring the neck. Different grip variations provide different choking options, although the basics are the same – you grab an opponent’s head from the front, placing it under an armpit, and then place the forearm of the same side arm on their neck. That is the gist of it, although it is the details that actually make it perfect. Before we move on to them, though, let’s answer some of the most common questions people ask about guillotine chokes:
Who Invented The Guillotine Choke?
The choke has been around for too long to pinpoint the person that has come up with it. It is a part of old Judo curriculums where it appears the “Mae Hadaka Jime”, or front naked choke.
There’s also evidence of it in early catch wrestling matches, as well as some of the wrestling matches in the first Olympic games in ancient Greece. In other words, the Guilltince choke has been about as long as grappling martial arts have. Bruce Lee helped popularize it among martial arts fans with his “Way Of the Dragon” movie.
Is The Guillotine A Blood Choke?
Yes and no depending on the way you’re holding the guillotine choke on your opponent. However, it is much more efficient when done as a blood choke than an air choke.
If you’re after a high-percentage finish, it is blood choke. Making the guillotine choke work as a blood choke will require a bit of fitness and more training because it involves very precise placement of your forearm. In fact, it is the most efficient done as a blood choke with a chest compression component (more on that later).
What Happens In Guillotine Choke?
During a guillotine choke, you first achieve control, by not allowing the person you’re attacking to pull their head out. What happens as a result of the initial grip on the chin (chin strap) and the placement of your armpit behind the crown of the head. That way, there’s no pulling out, or p[osturing up.
Secondly, you can apply choking pressure as a result of the specific positioning of your arms. The end goal should be pressure on the carotid arteries on both sides of the neck, along with forcing the chin of the head towards the opponent’s chest. This leaves the opponent in a painful position, and without enough oxygen to make the brain work, so they either tap or they will go to sleep.
Is The Guillotine Choke Legal in BJJ?
In terms of adult belt levels, the guillotine choke is legal for every white belt to black, with and without the Gi. It is, however, illegal for kids and teenagers, until the age of 16. In those cases, even getting into the position can lend a competitor in trouble. In Judo, only the arm-in guillotine is allowed, while the position is legal in wrestling for control, but not for finishing, as there are no submissions allowed.
How to Do A Guillotine Choke
The guillotine choke in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is fairly simple if you understand how it works. In order for you to execute any of the plenty variations available, you to understand how to set up. Let’s break it down into several steps that are essential to tapping people out with guillotine chokes.
1. Grips
First and foremost, you’ll need to get a hold of the head. I’ll cover grip variations in detail later on, but for now, you should know that each allows you to keep control of the head, and position the arms for a choke. For most guillotine choke variations, though, you’ll need to grab your palms together in order to finish. Grips come first in the hierarchy of guillotines.
2. Position
In terms of positioning, you can go for a guillotine from the bottom, mainly from the closed guard, half guard, and open guard. The half guard offers options for attacking from the top as well, as does the mount. Attacking against the turtle is one of the most common setups, and you can even look to set guillotines up from standing.
3. Angle
The angle at which you apply force for the choke is the “make it or break it” detail in every guillotine choke. Pulling like crazy with all your strength will not provide you with a finish. Instead, top, or bottom, you need to be looking to touch the elbow of the choking arm to your own hip on the same side. This provides the best possible angle for finishing any variation of the guillotine choke.
4. Application Of Force
This is the most versatile part of a guillotine. In every grip variation, there are slight differences in how you apply force. The general guidelines, though, are not to pull but rather to squeeze everything, which angling as previously described makes possible. Next up, you should look to “tack” the opponent, so that their hin goes to their chest, causing a chest compression effect. Also, remember that twisting the arms so that different parts of your arms press on the neck is also crucial to wrapping a guillotine choke up.
5. Adjustments And Combos
Finally, the guillotine is a high-control p[ostion and offers the option of switching between its many variations at will. For example, if an arm-in guillotine is not working for you, you can switch to a low elbow, and then perhaps, even a high-elbow variation. Or, you could “marry” the guillotine with other front headlock chokes like neckties, Darces, and Anacondas.
Follow these 5 steps and you’ll be able to develop an air-tight guillotine game that will be a puzzle for everyone to solve.
Guillotine Choke Grip Variations
As simple as it might seem, the guillotine choke is had complex mechanics that require long-term practice. This is opposite to it being a brute choke that can be learned in a few classes. Shocking, I know, but if you want a Daniel Strauss-like guillotine, you need to learn the technical nuances.
The guillotine choke has two “main” varieties when it comes to execution. The original version involves trapping the opponent’s arm while going for the choke. That’s the “arm-in guillotine”, which acts as an air choke. The second variation is done without the arm and can be both blood and an air choke.
Both guillotine variations revolve around the same basic principles. The most important part is to utilize the correct part of the arm for the choke. To avoid mistakes, it is best to place your thumb on the outside of the opponent’s neck. This allows for correct placement of the wrist and easy transitions between the two variations. Strapping the chin offers a very tight controlling position as well.
There are several grips available, with the Gable and S-grip as favorites.  Besides arm placement and grips, finishing relies on using the correct power source. A crucial principle of finishing a guillotine is to always push the crown of the opponent’s head towards their hips. To do so, one has to close both elbows towards their body and push with the hips while shrugging the shoulders. In the high elbow guillotine, the supporting arm’s elbow is placed upwards on the opponent’s shoulder.
The arm in guillotine requires an appropriate angle of the trapped arm. Namely, it should always extend past the head of the opponent. Opening up the arm allows the choking arm to correctly apply pressure on the windpipe.
Top Position Guillotines
The half guard and the mount are the two primary positions for executing a Guillotine choke. Since attacking it from the top half guard often leads to the mount transition, we’re going to focus on that.
In order to get into position for the guillotine from the top half, the hips have to be in the reverse Kesa Gatame position. This allows the knee of the bottom leg to control the opponent’s hips. At the same time, it positions the upper body correctly in order to wrap the head up. The torso is used to place pressure on the top of the head while the choking mechanics are applied. Although both versions of the guillotine can be done, the armless variation is used more often.
For the mounted guillotine, the focus should be on two main principles. First, the head has to be pulled towards the opponent’s hips. Secondly, you have to be placed in low mount, putting direct pressure on the opponent’s pelvis.
Attacking From The Bottom
The closed guard is the bread and butter position for the guillotine. It is a very strong finishing position due to the high control of the hips. Having both legs locked behind the opponent prevents any counters ensuring a high percentage finishing rate. Basically, the most important part of the closed guard set up for the Guillotine choke is breaking the posture. Once the head is placed in the armpit and forced back, it’s all about choking mechanics. And we already covered those, right?
In open guard environments, the butterfly guard is the best position for Guillotine hunting. Arm-dragging is the most usual route to setting up the butterfly guard guillotine. From there, having the control position can lead to a direct submission or a sweep. The sweep might even end up with you in position for a mounted guillotine finish. That way you get both the sweep and mount points as well as the sub.
Standing Guillotine Choke
Knowledge of the guillotine choke is going to solve a lot of your wrestling-related problems on the feet. It is the perfect double leg counter, both because it stuffs the takedown and leads to submission. The arm of variation is superior here, though both variations apply. The only extra detail that is crucial is timing. Even if the takedown is completed, the Guillotine has to be timed in order to land at the correct choking position.
In a more offensive manner, the Guillotine choke can be used from the snap-down or via an arm drag. The most direct route is the snap-down since it leads to greater control that can end in either a takedown or a finish. While going to the back is effective, looking to end up in the top half guard or mount is a more strategic approach. The choke can be finished while standing as well. Again, the emphasis is primarily on tight control by way of correct mechanics and secondly on finishing details.
Final Thoughts
The guillotine choke is one of the most powerful weapons available to you in all submission grappling martial arts. You can become a submission specialist by learning all its variations, or just become crazy good with only a single one of them. The choice is yours, but if you have any hope of progress in grappling, there’s no way forward without at least a decent guillotine choke.

We explain what this powerful choke is, how to do it, its variations and how to find it in a roll.
The guillotine choke is a common chokehold used in grappling arts, where you use your arms to surround and squeeze an opponent’s neck. It is regarded as one of the most versatile and efficient submissions out there, with its origins dating back to the ancient art of Pankration.
This article will go over the guillotine choke and all of its variations, including entries and common defenses if you are trapped in a guillotine. We will give some tips on how to have a strong guillotine and get the most out of this submission. This article was heavily influenced by legends of the sport such as John Danaher, Marcelo Garcia, Garry Tonon, Kron Gracie, and Gordon Ryan.
What is the guillotine choke?
The guillotine choke is one of the most popular chokeholds in martial arts. It is applied in front of the opponent and can be set up from various positions with or without the opponent’s arm. In this choke, arms are used to encircle the opponent’s neck to resemble a guillotine. Depending on how and where pressure is applied, the technique is either an air choke or a blood choke. Air chokes block the airflow through the trachea, while blood chokes cut off blood flow to the brain through the carotid arteries.
In jiu-jitsu, the guillotine is a popular technique, and many students become familiar with it early. As a result, many believe it is easy to escape from a guillotine and that it only works at the lower levels. However, there is a big difference between well-applied and poorly applied guillotines. A well-applied guillotine can finish anyone at any level of competition and is a move that everyone should try to master. Guillotine attacks are mostly carried out from the front headlock position, where one of our opponent’s arms and their neck is trapped.
Why the front headlock position is important for the guillotine
The front headlock is a position mainly used in wrestling and grappling. It is done by trapping your opponent’s head and arm with a chinstrap and elbow grip. There are many ways to enter this position, both from standing and on the ground.
Some of the most popular methods to get to the front headlock involve using snap downs to lower your opponent’s level and then wrapping your hands around them to secure the position.
In wrestling, strangles are not allowed, so a front headlock is used only to control an opponent and eventually try to pin him to the ground. However, in grappling, there is a large number of submissions that you can set up from the front headlock. Additionally, you can use a front headlock to go behind your opponent and take his back.
The four main positions you can apply a front headlock from
There are four different scenarios from which you can apply a front headlock. All of them differ and require you to employ different tactics:
You can get to this position from any standing situation. To do this, you need to lower your opponent’s head below your shoulders. This is usually done with snap downs. You can use this position to take your opponent to the ground or attempt standing guillotines.
This is popular in wrestling. You can get to this position from a standing front headlock or when your opponent tries to shoot for a takedown. Hip heists from the guard position are also a great way to get into a kneeling front headlock. This position is great for attacking submissions and going for your opponent’s back.
This variation is associated with submission grappling and jiu-jitsu. You can snap down your opponent from the guard position and get his head below your shoulders. From here, you can attack guillotines, but you cannot go for your opponent’s back.
You can use front headlocks when passing someone’s guard. A great example of this can be passing a seated guard or passing a half guard. Both options can lead to great follow-up attacks.
The three points of control required for the front headlock
No matter which type of front headlock you have, there are three crucial elements of control that you must employ. Let’s look at them.
If you use a right front headlock (you control your opponent’s head with your right hand), your right shoulder should always cover the back of your opponent’s neck. This prevents him from moving forward and going for a double leg or single leg takedown. When using the shoulder, your shoulder should move forward but not go high to your opponent’s upper back, as this will alleviate the pressure.
A chinstrap is an excellent way to control your opponent’s head and prevent him from moving backward. When holding a chinstrap, ensure that your elbow is retracted back and that you are activating your lat muscles. Also, bend your wrist at 90 degrees and cup it around the jaw. Combined with the pressure of your shoulder, you can control your opponent in both forward and backward directions.
Your free arm should always control your opponent’s elbow, as this will prevent him from countering you. Don’t connect your hands. Rather grab your opponent’s elbow either from the inside or outside. Make sure that your elbow is retracted back. Therefore, both elbows are attached to your ribcage.
Weaknesses of the front headlock
We have looked at the crucial control points from a front headlock position. Now, let’s look at some of the weaknesses your opponent can try to exploit and make your front headlock less effective.
Given that you control a right-handed front headlock, you should always connect your right elbow to your ribcage. If your elbow is exposed, your opponent can use elbow post methods and push it forward, which can expose your back.
This can also deteriorate your front headlock control. If your opponent can take control of your right wrist, he can stop your guillotine attempts and go for an escape.
The front headlock is excellent at stopping your opponent from moving forward and backward. However, it does not stop him from circling. If you control a right-handed front headlock, you should put your left leg up. This will help you follow him.
How to do a guillotine choke in 5 steps
There are many ways to do a guillotine choke. The technique can be set up from numerous positions. Also, there are a couple of variations of the technique. Here we will demonstrate how to do a fundamental guillotine from the closed guard position, called a low elbow guillotine. It is easy to do, and it is a great technique that you should consider learning first.
Before attacking with any techniques from the closed guard, you first must ensure that you have strong control over your opponent. Your hips should be above your opponent’s, and there should be no space between you and your opponent. Your legs should be locked as high as possible. From here, you can off-balance your opponent quite easily and go for attacks.
With your opponent’s posture upright and his hands on the floor, sit up and go for a traditional kimura sweep. Kimura sweep and guillotine from the closed guard work very well together; when your opponent blocks the sweep, you can always return to the guillotine. Wrap your arm over your opponent’s neck and grab a chinstrap grip on his jaw.
Once you have head control, secure double closure on your opponent’s neck. This means that your control hand should slide, and your fist should cover your opponent’s carotid artery. From there, you can connect your hands for a low elbow guillotine grip.
When you have a secure grip, you should shrimp away from your opponent and lock your legs over their hip (If you are controlling with your right hand, you should lock over their left hip).
For the finish, bring your knees to your chest and do a side crunch; your elbow should be pointing down. Make sure you are on your side and don’t extend your spine. Instead, use compression to finish the choke.
How to use the high wrist position to increase your guillotine power
When attacking from a front headlock, especially kneeling front headlocks, there is one adjustment that you can make to increase the power of your guillotines. John Danaher dubs this the high wrist position in his Enter the system: Front Headlock instructional. A high wrist position refers to any situation in which you take your strangle arm and put your wrist above your partner’s clavicle instead of holding a traditional chinstrap grip.
Once your wrist is high, you have double closure over your opponent’s neck. This means that both of his arteries are covered, and from there, the strangle is much stronger. Furthermore, the high wrist position allows you to use multiple guillotine variations. For example, you can attack both an arm-in and a high elbow guillotine. Here is an excellent study of this position utilized by the Danaher death squad.
You must perform a centerline shift to get into the high wrist position. Imagine that there is a line splitting your partner in half. When you hold a front headlock, your head is on one side of the centerline (if you have a right-handed chinstrap, your head should be on your opponent’s right shoulder). To get a high wrist position, move your head from the right shoulder to the left to get a high wrist position. This will give you the space to insert your wrist high and get to the position. Once your palm is above his shoulder, you know you are in a good position.
Below is a video of John Danaher explaining the centerline shift.
The 3 most important guillotine variations to know
There are various guillotine chokes that you can do in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and grappling. Some of them may be more popular than others, but all of them are amazing attacks. To become a true guillotine specialist, you should know how to attack with different guillotines. Here are the most important guillotines you should know:
The high elbow guillotine is one of the most powerful attacks in all grappling. It is a guillotine variation popularized by the legendary Marcelo Garcia. Thus it is also named the Marcelotine.
The marcelotine is a version where you use your non-choking hand and put your elbow above your opponent’s clavicle and point it to the ceiling. This creates an enormously tight strangle and blocks your opponent from reaching over your head (a common guillotine defense). Many believe that the high elbow guillotine requires a lot of shoulder mobility and flexibility. However, the key to this move is your head position or the so-called “centerline shift.”
Here’s a video by Marcelo Garcia explaining the marcelotine:
And here are some other videos you can watch to study the high elbow guillotine.
The low elbow guillotine is considered a “classic” variation of the guillotine. Beginners should consider learning this guillotine first because it is relatively simple. This guillotine was very common in the early days of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and grappling.
The most important part when going for a low elbow guillotine is to have double closure. This means that you must cover both of your opponent’s carotid arteries. From the chinstrap position, slide your hand inside and cover your partner’s artery with your fist. Your fist should be pointing at the ceiling, and you should feel like you are wrist-locking yourself. Connect your hands and retract your elbows to your ribcage. This will secure a tight strangle.
The arm-in guillotine is one of the most commonly used guillotine variations in mixed martial arts and grappling. Instead of wrapping the guillotine around your opponent’s neck only, this version goes around the opponent’s arm and neck.
Advantages of the arm-in guillotine
Attacking an arm-in guillotine has a couple of advantages. First, using this move on a resisting opponent is much easier. When your opponent drives into you, it can be challenging to lock a regular guillotine because he will reduce the space between his shoulder and your chest. Second, the arm-in guillotine has many follow-up attacks. When attacking with this guillotine, you can easily transition to moves such as the anaconda or Darce strangle. Additionally, you can attack an Omoplata from this position as well.
Disadvantages of the arm-in guillotine
Nonetheless, the arm-in guillotine has a disadvantage. The arm-in guillotine is a weaker strangle than a regular no-arm guillotine. This is because you are applying pressure against your opponent’s arm and neck. Many beginners shy away from this technique because it can be challenging to do it properly. Do not let this discourage you, as this can be a deadly stranglehold if you apply it correctly.
Arm-in guillotine grip variations
You can use several grip variations when going for an arm-in guillotine. The first is the high wrist position. As mentioned earlier, if you can get to a high wrist position, you can immensely increase your guillotines’ power. From the high wrist position, overhook your opponent’s arm and grab your wrist. Lock a closed guard, and do a side crunch for the finish. In case you cannot reach the high wrist position (seated front headlock), use a low elbow guillotine grip. You need to ensure that both arteries are covered and that there is double closure.
Another variation you can use is the Hingertine popularized by Josh Hinger. This guillotine uses a chinstrap grip and is performed as a tracheal choke instead of a blood choke. Cover your choking hand with your other hand and rotate your wrist into your opponent’s neck. Although this guillotine is not a blood choke, it is still very dangerous.
Here are some videos that you can watch to learn more about arm-in guillotines:
How to have a tight guillotine: 3 important tips
It takes practice and time to have a strong and tight guillotine. Many individuals become black belts but still have trouble with finishing this move. This is because guillotines require a great deal of precision and excellent timing. It is not a move that you can procrastinate with. Start by learning the mechanics of each variation, and after that, practice entries. The following tips will assist you. These tips apply to all guillotine variations.
The double closure principle has been mentioned several times in this article. This principle is the key to having a strong guillotine. You can get this by working towards a high wrist position or covering your opponent’s artery with your fist. Invest time in mastering this principle, and your guillotines will become much more robust.
When using guillotines, you should always try to cover your opponent’s neck with your shoulder. You know you have a good guillotine if you can’t see your opponent’s neck. A great way to ensure this happens is to put your chin close to your opponent’s upper back and round your spine.
To have a tight guillotine, you should be on your hip. Make sure you are not extending your spine when going for a finish. Instead, you should do a side crunch and connect your elbow to your hip.
Arm-in vs. arm-out guillotines: Which to learn first?
An arm-in guillotine is a stronger control than a no-arm guillotine. You don’t have many follow-up attacks if you attack a guillotine without an arm in. Additionally, if your opponent decides to roll, it may be hard to chase him. Nonetheless, an arm-in guillotine can be harder to finish than a regular guillotine.
Because of this, beginners should first consider learning a classic low elbow guillotine with the arm out. Once you understand the mechanics of the strangle, you can move to more complicated versions, such as the arm-in and high elbow.
Guillotine entries
A great feature of the guillotine choke is its versatility. You can set up a guillotine choke from almost any position in grappling. The only thing that is required is for you to get your opponent’s head below your shoulders.
The most popular entries to the guillotine are snap downs, which you can use both in the standing position and on the ground. Another great way to enter into a guillotine is to counter your opponent’s takedown attempt or when you pass the guard.
The standing position is great for entering guillotines and front headlocks. There are two main methods of entering from the standing position:
Another great way to enter into front headlocks and hunt for guillotines is the seated guard. A seated guard gives you a lot of mobility and can be great for off-balancing your opponent. From this position, you can go into front headlocks either by snapping your opponent down or performing a hip heist and rising above him. Let’s look at both methods.
When passing guard in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and grappling, a great way to pass is to threaten a submission to get a guard pass. Front headlocks and guillotines are an excellent way to do this. When you are on top, your shoulders are above your opponent’s head. This means that you can easily get to a headlock position and threaten guillotines. If your opponent defends the guillotine, he will concede a guard pass, and you will strangle him if he doesn’t defend. You can do this both from seated and half guard.
There is considerable danger in being caught in a guillotine choke. The technique is quite simple, and even a novice can attack with it. Because of this, it is crucial to know how to defend against it. We will look at defending against the low elbow guillotine from the closed guard we showed earlier.
Once you are caught in a guillotine, the first concern is defending your neck
Quickly grab the wrist of the arm encircling your neck and pull it down, as this will relieve some pressure. With your other hand, reach over your opponent’s back so that your hand is between his shoulder blades.
From here, drive into your opponent and put him on the shoulder of the opposite hand. If he is choking you with the right arm, put him on the left shoulder. Having taken the danger out of the choke, you can start extracting your head.
Keep your weight forward and place your forearm on your partner’s throat. Push into his neck, and pull his wrist down. This will weaken the grip and make it easy for you to slide your head out.
History of the guillotine
The guillotine choke has been a big part of combat for millennia. There are examples of guillotines on ancient Greek vases, and it is believed that this was a common technique in Pankration (an ancient version of mixed martial arts). The guillotine was also prevalent in the early days of judo and was known as mae hadaka jime. In popular culture, the legendary Bruce Lee used the guillotine against Chuck Norris in his 1972 movie “Way of the Dragon.”
Once submission grappling started developing and the Abu Dhabi Combat Club (ADCC) became a major event in the sport, guillotine submissions became very popular. One of the first guillotine specialists was Renzo Gracie. Renzo used the guillotine multiple times during his mixed martial arts and grappling career. He was famous for his arm-in guillotine, which he used to finish Sanae Kikuta in their match at Pride 2.
Another individual that will be remembered as one of the greatest guillotine specialists is Marcelo Garcia. It was Marcelo who invented the famous high-elbow guillotine, which he used to finish many fights in the ADCC.

The guillotine is a classic choke in many martial arts, including BJJ. It is intuitive, prevalent, and effective at all levels. But why is this choke named after an execution device so powerful and common?
The guillotine choke is a move where you surround the neck of the opponent with your arms, stopping the blood flow to the neck, air to the lungs, or a bit of both, to force him to surrender. Like any other blood choke, the guillotine has the potential to put someone to sleep very quickly.
The guillotine has many variations, entries, and defenses. As easy as it looks, finishing consistently against experienced grapplers is tricky. As a move all grapplers must master, a detailed look at all of its aspects is well worth your time reading, watching, and practicing on the mats.
What Is The Guillotine Choke?
The guillotine choke is among the most popular chokeholds in BJJ and many other grappling martial arts. It’s one of the first techniques taught to white belts, and it remains widespread even at the highest level of jiujitsu and MMA.
The guillotine is a choke applied from the front of the opponent, and the arms encircle the head and pressure the neck. His head is under the armpit, while the forearm pressures the neck. The choke is named after the very effective execution device widely used in the years of the French Revolution.
A guillotine can be either a blood or an air choke, depending on the angle. When it’s a blood choke, the forearm presses the carotid arteries and stops the blood flow to the brain, while when the tension is on the trachea, it becomes an air choke. In reality, the guillotine is often a bit of both, making it even worse to endure.
When To Use The Guillotine?
The guillotine is a very versatile move that can be applied from many places, which we will take a more detailed look at in the variations paragraph. But the most common variation is from a front headlock, making it a perfect weapon to counter careless takedowns.
The front headlock is a common position, usually resulting from a failed takedown attempt or a well-timed snap-down. The position is common in wrestling, but strangles are not allowed there, and the headlock serves only as a transition. But BJJ has many choke options from the position, with the guillotine being the primary one.
The most common variation of the guillotine is done from a closed guard, where you end up when you are taken down. The guillotine is highly effective against wrestlers who enter with double-leg takedowns with their heads unprotected.
This is even more valid for self-defense, where people are rarely aware. If someone is trying to take you down, I can almost guarantee you there is a window for a guillotine choke.
How To Do a Guillotine
There are many variations and setups for the guillotine, but we will start with the basic one you can use as an attack from closed guard. The other most common way is to use the guillotine as a counter to a double-leg takedown. In this case, the finishing steps are the same, but instead of being active, you are anticipating a takedown and reacting to it:
Here is how to execute the basic guillotine from full guard:
Step 1
Control the opponent from closed guard and make him place his hands on the mat. You can do this by using your legs to pull him towards you.
Step 2
Drive up for a kimura sweep, and when the opponent blocks the sweep, you wrap your arm around his neck while he is exposed and posted. Of course, if they don’t stop the sweep, you can continue with it. It’s important to quickly grab a chinstrap grip on his neck and squeeze your elbow so he doesn’t pop his head out.
Step 3
Grab your wrist with the other hand, connecting them while sitting back down, and lock in the full guard again. Your fist or forearm should be covering your carotid artery.
Step 4
The main factors for a successful guillotine are angle and compression.
Do not go straight back; instead, do a side crunch to the side where the opponent’s head is. It’s vital to be on the same hip as the strangling arm.
The entire head should be underneath your armpit, and your chin should be over his neck. Bring your elbow towards the hips and point it down.
How Does A Guillotine Choke Work?
The guillotine works either as a blood choke or an air choke, depending on how the pressure on the neck is applied, or often as a bit of both. When the choking arm presses on the carotid arteries in the neck, it stops blood flow to the brain.
At other angles, the forearm blocks the airway to the lungs by pressing against the trachea. It’s not rare for the head to be in a position with tension on the neck vertebrae, giving the guillotine some neck crank properties.
The result is discomfort and pain, causing the opponent to submit by tapping. If the choke is applied correctly, holding it leads to unconsciousness or even death if held for too long after that.
Blood chokes are very effective and can lead to a loss of conciseness in less than 10 seconds if applied tightly enough. When the choke is released, the person usually quickly wakes up without much repercussion.
Air chokes are much more painful and uncomfortable due to the pressure on the front of the throat, and they can lead to unconsciousness after 2 or 3 minutes of steady pressure. In sparring, the pain from an air choke quickly leads to a tap. The danger with air chokes, including the guillotine, is that they may cause damage to the trachea, which is life-threatening.
Guillotine Choke Variations
There are many variations of the guillotine differing by the position they are applied from and by different grips used to close off the arteries.
Arm In Guillotine Choke
The arm in guillotine is extremely common, and the difference with the classic one is that the head is still encircled with one arm. Still, the other goes around the arm of the opponent instead of being directly clasped to the choking arm.
The advantage of the arm in the guillotine is that it’s much easier to get. When the opponent is driving into you, be it on the ground or through a takedown, it’s difficult to be inside both his arms. The downside is that it’s less powerful and much harder to finish.
The best grip you can do for an arm in the guillotine is the high wrist, meaning your wrist is as far away from the chin as possible, and the neck falls near your elbow joint. This grip immensely increases the power of the choke. But the chinstrap grip can also be applied, turning the guillotine into an air choke.
Beginners usually shy away from this variation, but once you have more weapons in your toolkit, the arm can also be used to transition into other chokes like the Darce and Omoplata.
Standing Guillotine Choke
The standing guillotine is less common because, to succeed, you usually have to be taller than the opponent to produce enough pressure on his neck. But it is also the easiest to learn; you encircle the neck of the opponent and lock in your grip, with no other moves required.
It’s also very effective for self-defense, where pulling a guard on hard concrete is not ideal. The standing guillotine most often comes from the collar tie position, and you must find a way to put the head under your arm.
From there, you don’t have the leverage you have on the ground, but you can step closer to the opponent and pull your arm up with a very tight elbow to finish the choke.
Reverse Guillotine Choke
The reverse guillotine is more unorthodox than the other variations making it more surprising. The trick is that this guillotine uses a completely different grip, namely the figure four, much like what you would do in a Darce choke, but this time without the arm in.
The reverse guillotine is an excellent antidote to single-leg takedowns like the regular guillotine treats double legs.
Defending The Guillotine Choke
Knowing how to defend against guillotines is crucial because the move is simple and common among beginners and even people without training. You will certainly get into it often.
In general, the first rule in submission defense is not to panic. Picnicking and doing the wrong thing almost always make the chokes even tighter.
The first and most crucial step is to protect your neck by grabbing the choking arm’s wrist and alleviating as much pressure as possible.
This goes for both standing and grounded guillotine attempts. On the ground, you can put your forehead on the mat and push forward instead of pulling back, which releases some pressure.
If you are in a guillotine on the ground, you must try to exit the guard and hop to the other side of where your head is. This is done when the opponent is dragging you down in his guard. You are basically out of the choke if you succeed, even if he continues squeezing.
If caught in a standing guillotine, takedowns are the best defenses. When you are caught, immediately lift your head and step to the opposite side of where your head is. From there, you can lift him for a double leg or place your leg behind and drag him down.
Frequently Asked Guillotine Choke Questions
Is The Guillotine Choke Legal?
The guillotine choke is legal under all BJJ rulesets and for all belt levels. It is a common chokehold used by white belts and elite athletes in grappling and MMA. A guillotine may be penalized only if it’s turned deliberately into a neck crank.
What Happens If You Don’t Tap To A Guillotine?
All choke holds, including the guillotine, lead to loss of consciousness. Blood chokes need between 5 and 12 seconds to put you to sleep, while air chokes much longer and are significantly more painful. Either way, if you do not tap to a properly applied choke, you will sleep sooner or later.
What Does A Guillotine Choke Feel Like?
Luckily I haven’t been in a real guillotine, so I don’t have a comparison with that, but the guillotine choke does not feel good. When the blood to the brain is reduced, it sends stress signals terrifying to those unfamiliar with them. Most guillotine chokes are usually not tight enough to put you to sleep but are incredibly uncomfortable.
The windpipe is often pressed, or the neck is cranked, further increasing the nasty sensations. With experience, you will learn when the sensations are tolerable and when a choke will put you to sleep.
Can You Put Someone To Sleep With A Guillotine?
If a guillotine is tight enough, it can quickly put someone to sleep by stopping the blood flow to his brain. This process takes only about 9 seconds on average. The good part of it is once the pressure is released, the person quickly regains consciousness feeling not much worse than before quickly after.
Summary
The guillotine choke is very intuitive and easy to do but hard to master and finish. Many small details in play make it effective, and you will need to know them if you want to submit more experienced people. The guillotine will be with you from the first BJJ lessons you take, so you’d better become good at using and defending it.

How to Correctly Apply a Rear Naked Choke Submission
The rear naked choke (RNC) submission is a technique that originated from the martial art known as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). BJJ is a self-defense style that involves subduing an assailant by applying intricate locks and holds around limbs while adding pressure on them by arching your hips, using your strength or by torqueing your body. BJJ requires both individuals to be on the ground. To achieve the full effectiveness of BJJ, one must obtain dominant position over the attacker. For the RNC, you must acquire a dominant position that controls the attacker from the back. Hopefully after reading this, you will be able to defend yourself from an aggressor with this timeless technique.
There are two types of chokes used in BJJ, air chokes that suffocate the attacker by restricting the amount of air from getting to the brain, and blood chokes. The RNC is a blood choke that restricts the blood flow in the two carotid arteries. Carotid arteries are located on the left and right sides of your neck. These arteries supply the head and neck with oxygenated blood and if you prevent blood from reaching the brain, one can pass out in a matter of seconds. But if you choke someone for too long, one can potentially die. So, it is very important to apply the RNC correctly to avoid unwanted fatality. To get the full effectiveness of any submission, you must secure a dominant position before you apply any technique. These requirements apply to every submission including the RNC.
The position you must secure is known as the back mount. Before you can obtain the back mount, you must be behind the assailant so that their back is facing towards you. The back mount is a position that fully controls an assailant’s hips and upper body. The result of the back mount will prevent someone from escaping and will give you the highest probability of cinching in the RNC. To achieve the back mount, you must control the attacker’s upper body with the over-under grip. This grip requires that both your arms are wrapped firmly across one’s chest like a one-strap backpack. The over-under grip is secured by getting one arm over the top of one shoulder while simultaneously pushing one arm through the opposite armpit and grabbing your over arm. It is vital that your bottom hand grabs your top wrist, never the other way around. This important detail will prevent you from being thrown over the top of the assailant’s back.
After firmly securing the over-under grip, you must sink in hooks to control the aggressor’s lower body and hips. Hooks can be obtained by hooking your feet into the inside of the assailant’s thighs. As you are securing the hooks, it is essential that you do not let go or loosen the over-under grip as you may lose the back mount which will sabotage your attempt in executing the RNC. After you obtain both the over-under grip and hooks to achieve full control of the back, the attacker will have extreme difficulty defending him or herself. The assailant will not only struggle getting you off their back, but they will also struggle to defend the RNC as well as punches.
Now that you cinched in the back mount, you will be able to work the RNC in confidently and safely as the assailant’s movement is neutralized. With the over-under grip, not only are you controlling the attacker’s upper body, you have earned the opportunity to slide the over arm around the neck and choking them into submission or unconsciousness. The over arm is placed around the aggressor’s neck so that your bicep pushes against one carotid artery while your forearm pushes against the other. To gain the full effectiveness of the RNC, wrap the attacking arm around the neck so that the point of your elbow is either exactly parallel to their chin or close to parallel. To lock up the RNC, place the hand of the attacking arm on the bicep of your other arm while procedurally placing the hand of the other arm on the back of the aggressor’s head. To complete the RNC, squeeze your arms around their neck while pushing out your chest against their back to force their neck deeper into your arms. Note that if this is a street fight, you should tuck your chin down against the back of the attacker’s head so they cannot gouge your eyes or punch you in the head.
The RNC is an effective technique to defend yourself with. It is characterized by its ability to neutralize an aggressor’s movement with the back mount in order to subdue them with a powerful blood choke. To gain full confidence in this technique, live drills are recommended. I hope you find this submission as valuable as I do as BJJ is something that I am very passionate about. BJJ is a beautiful martial art as it understands how the manipulation of body positioning can be a sufficient way of defending yourself.

Mastering the Rear Naked Choke: A Comprehensive Guide to BJJ 101 and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Submissions
The rear naked choke, also known as the ""RNC"", is one of the most effective and feared submissions in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and MMA. This powerful choke can quickly put your opponent to sleep by cutting off blood flow to the brain.
In this comprehensive guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about the rear naked choke, from its history and anatomy to step-by-step finishing details. Whether you're a white belt learning your first submission or a seasoned black belt polishing your technique, this article will help take your RNC to the next level.
A Brief History of the Infamous Rear Naked Choke
The rear naked choke has origins in ancient martial arts and grappling styles across the world. Images of ancient Egyption wrestlers applying chokeholds date back over 5,000 years.
In Japanese martial arts, the technique was referred to as ""hadaka jime"" meaning ""naked strangle."" It became one of the official choking techniques of Kodokan Judo when the system was formalized in the early 1900s.
The Gracie family helped popularize the choke in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu through legendary challenge matches designed to prove BJJ's effectiveness. It remains one of the core submissions taught at every BJJ academy today.
The RNC gained worldwide fame through the early days of mixed martial arts. Royce Gracie used it to decimate opponents in the first UFC events, showing viewers how this simple choke could nullify an untrained opponent.
Why Is the Rear Naked Choke So Effective?
There are several key reasons why the rear naked choke reigns supreme as one of the most efficient submissions:
Anatomical Vulnerability of the Neck
The neck has little muscle mass and is extremely vulnerable to blood choke attacks. Gripping the biceps or shins relies on strength and squeezing power. But even a child can apply an effective blood choke if positioned correctly.
Back Control Position
The RNC is applied from back control, the most dominant position in grappling. The person applying the choke controls the hips and upper body, limiting defensive options.
Less Strength Required
Chokes require more technique than strength. The rear naked choke in particular relies on leverage, angle, and proper hand positioning over brute force.
Low Risk of Injury
When applied with control, the rear naked choke has a lower risk of injury than joint locks. It does not damage muscles, tendons, or ligaments like knee bars or heel hooks.
Rear Naked Choke Step-by-Step
Now let's break down the rear naked choke step-by-step to help you get the cleanest, quickest tap:
Step 1: Establish Back Control
Taking the back and securing control is a prerequisite for applying the RNC. There are many ways to take the back such as the seatbelt grip pass.
Key points for establishing back control:
Step 2: Insert Your Choking Arm
With back control secured, insert your choking arm (the arm that will be around your opponent's neck).
Reach across your opponent's neck deep, as close to the collar bone as possible. The crook of your elbow should be tucked under your opponent's chin.
Your bicep and forearm should pin down one side of the neck while your hand grips the back of the shoulder.
Step 3: Lock Your Hands
Now take your second hand and lock it onto your choking hand. The most common grip is hand-to-bicep.
You can also use a Gable grip with both hands or a S-grip with palms together. The hand-to-bicep creates a stronger choke with less grip strength needed.
Step 4: Break Their Posture Down
At this point your opponent will defend the choke by hiding their chin or hunching their back. You need to break their posture down.
Drive your head next to theirs and use your hooks to stretch them out. Arch your back and extend your legs. This exposes the neck more.
Step 5: Angle Off and Finish the Choke
For maximum leverage, angle off 45-90 degrees to the side. Falling to the opposite side of your choking arm is preferable.
To finish, make a fist with your choking hand. Turn your wrist so your knuckles face you. Then drive your fist up at an angle under your opponent's chin.
Squeeze your elbows together using your whole body. The choke will come on quickly once positioned properly. Hold it until your opponent taps or goes unconscious.
3 Rear Naked Choke Variations and Setups
While the traditional RNC works wonders, there are also some high percentage variations and sneaky setups to make your choke even more dangerous:
Rear Naked Choke with Palm on Head
By cupping your palm on the back of your opponent's head, you can exert extra forward pressure to cinch up the choke faster:
One-Handed Rear Naked Choke
If you only have one arm free, the one-handed RNC is possible although lower percentage. Use it as a sneak attack if they're focused on the other arm:
Bait and Switch Rear Naked
This setup tricks your opponent into defending the wrong side of their neck:
Common Rear Naked Choke Mistakes to Avoid
While the RNC is high percentage when done properly, small mistakes can allow your opponent to escape. Be aware of these common errors:
Rear Naked Choke Defense Tips
The RNC comes on quickly once it's locked in fully. But there are defensive tactics you can try to prolong getting caught or escape the submission:
Closing Thoughts on the Infamous RNC
Learning to properly apply the rear naked choke is a rite of passage in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. All grappling greats throughout history have mastered this technique.
While it may seem simple on the surface, small details like hand positioning, angle, and posture make a huge difference in whether you can finish the choke or not.
Drill the rear naked choke relentlessly until it becomes second nature. It should be one of your highest percentage attacks from the back. When you can slap on this submission at will, your jiu jitsu game will reach a new level.
So attack the back and hunt for that RNC! Oss!

Everything You Need to Know About the Rear Naked Choke
Self-defense techniques often include various methods of mata, or choking, to incapacitate an attacker. One of the most effective techniques is the hadaka-jime, commonly known as the rear-naked choke. This move involves placing one arm under the opponent's trachea and the other around the front of the opponent's neck, creating a choke hold.
Sleeper Hold For Self Defense
In self-defense scenarios, the use of the opponent's clothing can be advantageous. You can grasp their collar or shirt to make the choke even tighter, increasing the pressure on their neck. However, it's crucial to understand that applying a choke requires skill and precision, as well as the ability to gauge the level of force required.
Choke with an Arm Trap
Choke with an Arm Trap is a highly effective submission technique employed in various martial arts, including Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and judo. In this technique, the practitioner strategically wraps their arm around an opponent's neck, creating a powerful restraint. The key to its success lies in the precise placement of the arm trap, often positioning it around an opponent's neck while simultaneously using the other arm to apply pressure.
This method maximizes control and constriction. The legs and arching motion, in coordination with the choke, restrict the source of blood to the brain, ultimately leading to unconsciousness if the choke is applied correctly. For those looking to defend against this technique, the best way to block is to focus on raising the opposite shoulder, creating a barrier between the opponent's arm and the neck, preventing the restriction of blood flow to the brain.
Developing a deep understanding of these constriction techniques is crucial for practitioners, as mastery of this technique goes beyond its popularity outside of Brazil and can be an invaluable asset in self-defense scenarios. Proper execution involves leveraging the opponent's body and positioning the arm under their armpit, maximizing the effectiveness of the chokehold.
Clasp Your Arms to Finish the Choke
When applying a rear-naked choke, the attacker's bottom hand clasps onto their own bicep, while the top hand wraps around the opponent's neck and grabs their own shoulder. This creates a vice-like grip that restricts blood flow to the brain, potentially leading to unconsciousness in a few seconds if the choke is held long enough.
Stop The Choke
To defend against a choke, the ability to block the choke is essential. This can be achieved by raising the opposite shoulder to create a barrier between the attacker's arm and your neck. If the choke is already applied, trying to block the choke becomes more challenging as 10 seconds can feel like an eternity when facing the potential for unconsciousness.
In martial arts, such as kodokan judo, practitioners learn various constriction techniques that can be applied to control or subdue an opponent. These techniques often involve chokes and require the use of proper leverage and timing. In a real-life situation, an opponent will likely have the ability to defend, so it's essential to have a deep understanding of self-defense techniques and the principles behind them.

The triangle choke is a highly effective Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) submission technique that has been utilized successfully in both sport grappling competitions and real-life self-defense situations. This versatile move can be applied from various positions, offering practitioners a potent tool for controlling and submitting opponents. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the mechanics, setups, variations, and counters of the triangle choke, empowering both beginners and experienced grapplers to add this formidable technique to their arsenal.
The triangle choke is executed by wrapping one's legs around an opponent's neck and arm in a triangular configuration, thereby constricting blood flow to the brain and causing unconsciousness if applied correctly. The choke can be performed from the guard position, where the practitioner is on their back with their legs wrapped around their opponent's torso.Establishing the Guard: Begin by pulling your opponent into your closed guard, maintaining control over their posture and positioning.
Creating Angles: Use hip movement and grips to create angles that facilitate the setup for the triangle choke. This may involve breaking your opponent's posture and controlling their arms.
Securing the Triangle: With one arm isolated, bring your leg across the back of your opponent's neck while simultaneously trapping their arm against your torso.
Locking the Triangle: Secure the triangle by clasping your ankle behind your knee and pulling down on your shin, creating pressure on your opponent's neck.
Variations:Arm Triangle Choke: In this variation, the opponent's own arm acts as one side of the triangle, enhancing the choke's effectiveness.
Inverted Triangle Choke: This variation involves executing the triangle choke while inverted, often from positions such as the omoplata or from the back.
Counters:Posture and Pressure: Maintaining good posture and applying pressure can make it difficult for your opponent to set up the triangle choke.
Stacking and Passing: By stacking your opponent and passing their guard, you can alleviate pressure from the triangle choke and potentially transition to a more advantageous position.

The triangle choke is one of the most common and versatile strangulations in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and one of the most visually recognizable ones. The move originates in judo and has become a hallmark of BJJ and one of the first techniques taught to beginners.
The triangle choke is a strangulation technique in which we use our legs to stop the blood flow to the opponent’s brain. The signature figure four shape of the legs creates a triangle shape between them where the opponent is trapped, giving the name of this submission.
Because the triangle is so powerful and versatile, it’s one of the techniques you will have to master or at least be competent with both offensively and defensively, regardless of your style. This guide will take you step by step through how to execute a front triangle, how to defend one, and the most common variations.
How To Do A Triangle Choke
Step 1 – Creating a One-in/One out Scenario
The requirement to perform a triangle choke is to first achieve a one-arm-in, one-arm-out scenario.
We must trap one of our opponents’ arms and his head with our legs. This is usually done by grip control and off-balancing the opponent.
In a gi, this is usually done with a collar and sleeve grip, while in a no-gi, you have to work a bit harder to secure a dominant wrist grip.
From guard, you need to compromise the opponent’s balance to make him post his hand on the mat, where you can grab his wrist and separate the arm.
This arm will be the arm-out of the equation, while you must also take hold of the other arm and keep it close to your body—this is the arm-in.
Step 2 – Shooting up the triangle
After the opponent is out of balance and we have separated the arms, it’s time to shoot up the triangle trap.
This is done by quickly lifting the leg directly to the neck of the partner on the arm-out side.
Pull the other hand you control and lift your leg. At this point, the position looks like a closed guard with one arm inside. This position is sometimes called “triangle trouble.”
Step 3 – Angling Off and Converting to the Figure Four
The angle is crucial for a successful triangle finish. It is the position of the primary leg, which is directly on the neck.
At this point, you must angle off to the side with or without the help of the leg on the shoulder side of the opponent and turn in the direction of the neck leg.
Once you have the right angle and the opponent’s shoulder is outside of your triangle, you can lock in the full figure four by shooting your other leg up and, ideally, putting the ankle of the primary leg behind the knee of the second leg.
Step 4 – Finishing The Triangle
With the correct angle and the opponent’s inside shoulder out of the way, you can apply tremendous pressure.
Bring the heel of the second leg down and your knees together. A good, sustained squeeze should make the opponent tap or enter dreamland.
A good detail to implement is to undercook the leg opposite the arm inside to prevent the opponent from moving around or standing up, which is a primary defense, especially in MMA, where slams are allowed.
Defending The Triangle Choke
Just as important as knowing how to attack with triangles, you must also know how to defend them.
The best option is never to get caught in one and avoid being caught with one arm in. But it’s inevitable that you will find yourself in a bad spot sooner or later, so it’s good to know your options.
Good posture prevents many triangle setups and is the best way to avoid trouble. If you find yourself in the triangle trouble position, immediately posture up and drive your hips forward.
This can separate the legs of the opponent or at least buy you some time.
The best escapes are early on before the opponent locks up tight. The key points are moving around, not letting him have the dominant angle, and keeping your shoulder inside the triangle.
Before he has the right angle, it’s easier to pull up and separate his legs.
If things are already tight, you don’t have many options or much time. The only chance of escaping this late is by freeing both your hands and creating some space around your neck by pushing his knee.
With both hands on his knee, push his strangling leg to the floor to kill the angle.
During this time, your shoulder should already be partially inside the triangle, which will help you exit from behind the primary leg.
Different scenarios elicit different solutions, so here are a few more escapes from triangle chokes in different stages:
Triangle Choke Variations
Aside from the popular front triangle from guard, a few other variations are applicable from different positions. Some are rarer, others more common, but all are a worthy inclusion to the arsenal.
Triangle From Mount
The triangle is a viable option from mount when we already have the dominant positions.
The sequence is longer than the front triangle, but it can surprise the opponent. Once locked, you have to option to apply the pressure from the mounted position like this:
Or use the opportunity to transition into a front triangle:
Rear Triangle
Rear triangles are a great option from the back and have recently become very popular.
When attacking with this type of triangle, the crucial element is to have your opponent’s arm extended over his head and his elbow on your chest.
What Is The Triangle Choke
The triangle choke in Brazilian jiu-jitsu is one of the most popular, effective, and versatile strangulations you can do.
The main element in all triangle variations is that we use our legs in a triangular figure-four shape around the head and one arm of the opponent.
This lock cuts off the blood flow from the carotid arteries to the brain, causing loss of consciousness if the opponent does not submit. This is why triangles fall into the category of blood chokes.
The triangle is so popular in all its variations because it’s incredibly versatile and can be applied in many scenarios.
It’s equally applicable and effective in gi and no-gi. It’s just as good in real fights and MMA, where a punching arm is easily separated for the one-arm-in, one-arm-out setup needed for a triangle choke.
Another general point making triangles so popular is that chokes are often better than joint locks because some people are much more flexible and can withstand enormous pressure on their joints.
Additionally, some are willing to sacrifice a joint and not tap. Still, no amount of courage or willpower can save them from going to sleep once the blood flow to the brain stops.
The triangle choke requires some dexterity in the legs and hips.
It can be challenging to lock against someone much bigger, but while the length of your legs is important, much more so are the positions you set up and finish the triangle.
Furthermore, the different shoulder and neck builds of opponents will always require adjustments.
So while the triangle is a seemingly straightforward submission, it requires years of diligent practice to master and finish consistently.
Here is how to do the most popular variation of the triangle choke, called the front triangle, in detail.
Frequently Asked Triangle Choke Questions
How Does A Triangle Choke Work?
The triangle is a blood choke that stops the blood flow to the brain by placing pressure on the neck by the attackers’ legs locked in a figure four position.
On one side, the pressure is placed directly on the neck, while on the side, the leg squeezes the shoulder to the neck. Blook chokes can cause loss of consciousness in 5 to 12 seconds if applied tight enough.
Does A Triangle Choke Hurt?
Triangle chokes hurt, but this is not their main purpose. When applied properly, the triangle creates a feeling of pressure more than it does cause pain.
Who Invented The Triangle Choke?
Many of the moves found in Brazilian jiu-jitsu have been around for much longer and come from other martial arts, usually judo. The case with the triangle is the same.
The creation of this submission is credited to 20th-century Judo masters Tsunetane Oda and Kanemitsu Yachibei Hyoe. Still, the origin lies in older traditional Japanese jiu-jitsu.
The choke was transferred to BJJ by Rolls Gracie, who probably found the move in an old judo book and started implementing it as a main closed-guard attack in addition to the armbar.
The triangle has since become a hugely popular move in BJJ and MMA, where Royce Gracie used it to submit Dan Severn in UFC 4.
Summary
Like almost all BJJ submissions, with the triangle, every little detail matters. The possible setups and ways to finish triangles allow for different interpretations by different grapplers with endless opportunities.
It is also a clean and precise submission, the likes of which are responsible for the moniker of BJJ as the “gentle art.”
This guide cannot encompass every single detail, but it is enough to take your triangle knowledge pretty far. You can learn from the experts and develop your unique approach from there. True mastery of the triangle requires years of practice, but you will get there with attention to detail and diligent work.

Understanding Triangle Chokes in BJJ
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art focusing on ground fighting and grappling. Among the many techniques it employs, the triangle choke holds a special place due to its effectiveness and versatility. This technique involves trapping an opponent's arm and head within your legs, forming a triangle shape—hence the name.
The BJJ triangle, or triangle hold, is not only one of the most iconic submissions in BJJ but also in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). It's a move that can be performed from various positions, including from your back, making it highly versatile.
The key to this move lies in the positioning of your legs. The leg chokes in BJJ, particularly the triangle choke, are designed to constrict an opponent's blood flow, leading them to either submit or lose consciousness. This is achieved by creating pressure around their neck with one leg while using the other to secure the hold and prevent escape.
The triangle jiu-jitsu move is an excellent example of how BJJ emphasizes technique over strength. Regardless of size or strength differences, anyone trained in this technique can successfully apply it with proper execution.
Understanding triangle chokes in BJJ means comprehending how to use your body—specifically your legs—to effectively control and submit your opponent. The power of this submission lies not just in its ability to end matches but also in its strategic value: it can be used as both an offensive tool and a defensive response, depending on circumstances.
What is a Triangle Choke?
A Triangle Choke, or ""triangle jiu-jitsu move,"" often referred to in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), is a powerful and versatile submission technique. This chokehold, executed primarily using the legs, is designed to constrict an opponent's carotid artery, thereby cutting off blood flow to the brain and forcing them into submission.
The name ""triangle choke"" derives from the shape formed by the practitioner's legs when executing this manoeuvre. One leg passes under the opponent's neck. In contrast, the other leg wraps over that ankle.
It rests behind the opponent's back, forming a figure similar to a triangle. It can be applied from various positions, including guard position, side control, and even from the back - known as a rear triangle choke.
The triangle hold or choke hold with legs, as it's also known, is not exclusive to BJJ. Various martial arts have adopted it due to its effectiveness. However, it gained significant attention through BJJ because of its strategic use in numerous competitions and MMA fights.
A triangle choke is not just about strength; it requires proper technique and timing. The practitioner must control their opponent's body movement while applying pressure via their legs around the neck. Understanding this move is essential for anyone aspiring to master BJJ or grappling-based martial arts.
The Origin of the BJJ Triangle
The BJJ Triangle, also known as the triangle choke, is a signature move in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with its roots deeply embedded in this martial art's history. The technique was initially developed from traditional Judo practices, specifically the sankaku-jime, or triangle strangle.
In the early 20th century, Mitsuyo Maeda, a Judo founder Jigoro Kano student, brought his knowledge to Brazil. Carlos Gracie Sr., one of Maeda's students, adapted these techniques into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
The BJJ triangle evolved and refined as practitioners understood its effectiveness better. In particular, the Gracie family played a significant role in its development. They recognized the power of using legs—rather than just arms—to control and submit opponents. This realization increased focus on ground fighting and submissions like the triangle choke.
The move gained international fame when Royce Gracie used it successfully in several matches during the early days of UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship). His victories showcased the effectiveness of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. They highlighted how potent techniques like the triangle choke could be against more extensive, vigorous opponents.
Today, the BJJ Triangle is fundamental to any practitioner's arsenal. It's taught early on due to its efficiency and versatility—it can be executed from various positions, including guard, mount, and even from your back. Its importance is reflected by its frequent use in jiu-jitsu competitions and mixed martial arts fights worldwide.
How Does a Triangle Choke Work?
A Triangle Choke, or a Jiu Jitsu Triangle, is a type of submission hold in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) that strangles the opponent by encircling the opponent's neck and one arm with the legs in a configuration similar to a triangle. The technique is so named because of the triangular shape this method forms.
The fundamental principle behind a triangle choke lies in using your leg chokes BJJ to exert pressure on your opponent's neck, causing them to tap out or lose consciousness. It's essential to note that it's not just about strength but also leverage and proper positioning.
To understand how it works, picture this: Your legs form two sides of the triangle while your opponent's shoulder and neck include the third side. One leg goes across the back of your opponent's neck, applying pressure on one carotid artery, cutting off blood flow from the heart to the brain.
The other leg secures everything in place, going under the arm and locking around the ankle or shin of your first leg. The trapped arm then pushes against its neck when you squeeze your thighs together, blocking off the other carotid artery. This dual action cuts off blood flow entirely if done correctly.
This is where understanding the triangle hold jiu-jitsu becomes crucial. During a triangle choke, the triangle hold is how you lock your legs around your opponent's head and arm. Your bottom leg must be across their neck with your foot under their armpit, while your top leg locks over your bottom ankle, securing everything tightly.
Remember that efficiency in executing a triangle choke isn't simply about power; it's also about precision. Even if you have strong legs, without proper placement and technique, an attempt at a triangle choke may fail against a knowledgeable adversary who knows how to defend against it.
The Science Behind the Leg Chokes in BJJ
The science behind the leg chokes in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), including the infamous triangle choke, is fundamentally based on blood flow restriction. BJJ practitioners use their legs to pressure an opponent's arteries, specifically those supplying blood to the brain. This submission method isn't about strength but leverage, precision, and technique.
In a triangle choke, you use your legs to form a triangle around your opponent's neck and one arm. Here's how it works:
Your thigh applies pressure to one side of the opponent's neck.
The opponent's shoulder, pushed by your calf or hamstring, exerts pressure on the other side of your neck.
Your ankles are locked together to secure the hold and maintain pressure.
This configuration results in a chokehold that blocks blood flow from both carotid arteries, which supply oxygenated blood to the brain. When performed correctly, this can lead to rapid unconsciousness due to a lack of oxygen in the brain.
While these chokes affect blood flow, it's important to note that they should not impede air passage. A well-executed triangle choke won't cause difficulty breathing because it doesn't put pressure on the windpipe.
The effectiveness of leg chokes lies in their ability to leverage lower body strength against an opponent's vulnerable areas, like the neck. Since our legs are typically more robust than our arms, these techniques can be very effective even against larger opponents.
However, understanding the science behind these moves is as crucial as physical practice for mastering them effectively and safely in BJJ training or competition scenarios.
Understanding the Triangle Hold Jiu-Jitsu
The Triangle Hold in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a technique that uses the legs to immobilize an opponent's neck and arm, creating a choke. Often referred to as the leg triangle choke, this hold is a fundamental move in BJJ and is widely used in training and competition.
To execute the triangle hold, you must be on your back with your opponent positioned between your legs. The goal is to trap one of their arms inside your legs while the other remains outside. This positioning creates a triangular shape called a ""triangle choke.""
The first step in executing this hold involves pulling down on your opponent's sleeve while simultaneously raising your hip and pivoting to one side. This movement allows you to place one leg under the trapped arm and across your opponent's back while the other leg locks over the ankle of the first leg, forming a figure-four coil.
The effectiveness of this hold lies in its ability to apply pressure on both sides of the neck. The trapped arm pushes against one side of the neck while your thigh applies pressure on the other side. This dual pressure restricts blood flow from the carotid arteries to the brain, causing disorientation or unconsciousness if not released in time.
It's important to note that, unlike some chokes, which rely solely on brute strength, success with a triangle hold relies more heavily on proper technique and timing. It's not just about squeezing as hard as possible; it's about applying pressure at specific points for maximum effect.
In addition, like all moves in BJJ, practising this choke requires respect for your training partners' safety. Always apply chokes slowly during practice sessions and be ready to release immediately if your partner taps out.
Understanding how to execute and apply a triangle hold properly can be an effective weapon in any BJJ practitioner's arsenal. Mastering this technique can provide significant advantages during grappling exchanges, whether used defensively when fighting off your back or offensively when seeking submissions from top positions.
How to Do an Arm Triangle
An Arm Triangle, a side choke, is a joint submission move in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). This technique involves using your arm and torso with the opponent's shoulder to apply pressure on both sides of your neck, leading to a choke.
To execute an arm triangle, follow these steps:
Establish Position: Start from the mount or side control position. Your goal is to get one of your opponent's arms up by their head, similar to the salute position.
Secure The Arm: Once your opponent's arm is in the correct position, use your corresponding arm (if it's their right, use your right) to go under their armpit and secure their neck.
Switch Sides: Now that you've secured the neck and trapped the opponent's arm, slide your knee closest to the opponent's hip over and across their belly and switch sides.
Apply Pressure: Lay down perpendicular to your opponent while keeping hold of their neck and head. Use your free hand (the one not securing their channel) for the base or to grab onto them for added pressure.
Finish The Choke: To finish the choke, squeeze your elbows together while pulling your choking arm towards you and pushing your body into theirs.
Remember that every BJJ move requires practice to master. Understanding how each step works and why it works that way is essential. For instance, switching sides after securing the arm helps tighten the chokehold by allowing you to use your whole body weight against them instead of just upper body strength.
The critical element in executing a compelling arm triangle is patience and maintaining control throughout each step. If done correctly, this can be a potent submission technique in BJJ that can catch many opponents off guard due to its unexpected nature from certain positions.
Step-by-Step Guide: How to do a Triangle Choke
Executing a triangle choke in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) involves precise movements and positioning. The goal is to trap your opponent's arm and neck between your legs, cutting off their blood flow and forcing them to tap out.
Establish Your Guard: Start by having your opponent in your guard, which means you're on your back with your legs wrapped around them.
Create an Angle: You must shift at an angle relative to your opponent. You can achieve this by grabbing their wrist and pulling it towards you while moving your hips in the opposite direction.
Leg Positioning: Bring one of your legs up and place it on the shoulder of the same side as the arm you've controlled. This leg acts as a barrier preventing them from escaping.
Arms Control: Use both hands to pull down on the free arm of your opponent, bringing their posture down.
Secure the Triangle: Bring up your other leg and lock it over the ankle of the first leg, creating a figure-four or ""triangle"" shape with your legs around the neck and one arm inside.
Squeeze Your Legs Together: To finish the triangle choke, squeeze your thighs together while pulling down on their head with both hands.
Wait for The Tap: If done correctly, they should tap out due to lack of blood flow to their brain.
Remember, practice makes perfect when it comes to BJJ techniques like these - so keep drilling this move until it becomes second nature!
The leg triangle, also known as the triangle chokehold in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), is a powerful submission technique that can be used to control and potentially submit an opponent. It involves using both legs to form a triangle around the opponent's neck, hence its name. Here's how it works:
Positioning: The first step in executing a leg triangle chokehold is getting into the correct position. You must have one of your legs under the opponent's armpit and your other leg over their shoulder, effectively trapping their arm and head between your thighs.
Formation of Triangle: Once you're in this position, you must ensure that your ankle under the opponent's armpit is locked behind the knee of your other leg, forming a triangle with your legs.
Application of Pressure: The next step is applying pressure. You do this by pulling down on the back of their head while pushing up with your hips. This creates a choking effect, restricting blood flow from the carotid arteries to the brain.
Securing the Choke: Finally, you ensure the choke by holding your shin with one hand, putting your other hand on the back of your head, and pushing it down into the choke.
Remember, when performing a triangle chokehold using legs in BJJ, focusing on choking and maintaining control over an opponent throughout its application is crucial. This ensures they don't escape or counter-attack while you're attempting this move.
Moreover, while practising this move, safety should be paramount; therefore, ensure that you release pressure once your partner taps out during practice sessions.
In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), positioning is a fundamental principle, especially when executing complex moves like the triangle choke. The importance of positioning cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the effectiveness of your submission. In this case, your triangle jiu-jitsu move.
To execute a successful triangle choke, you must first secure a dominant position over your opponent. This usually involves being on the bottom in a guard position with one arm of your opponent trapped between your legs. The correct positioning can be broken down into three main components: control, angle, and tightness.
Control: You must maintain control over your opponent's posture and movements. This is achieved by using both legs and arms effectively. One leg goes over the shoulder of the opponent while controlling their head or neck. In contrast, the other leg wraps around their neck, creating a 'leg triangle' that traps them.
Angle: The angle at which you apply the choke also significantly affects its effectiveness. A common mistake beginners make is trying to use the choke straight on; instead, you should aim for an angle off to one side. Pivoting on one foot, you can easily change your pitch to get into the optimal position for applying pressure with your thighs against the neck.
Tightness: Finally, tightness is key in ensuring no gaps for your opponent to escape from. Once you've established control and found the right angle, you need to lock everything in place tightly but without sacrificing comfort or stability.
A well-executed triangle jiu-jitsu move relies heavily on these positioning principles. It's not about brute strength; it's about strategic placement and leverage that allows smaller practitioners to submit larger opponents with triangle chokes successfully.
Remember, practice makes perfect – so keep drilling these principles until they become second nature!
Rear Triangle Choke: A Detailed Examination
The Rear Triangle Choke, or the ""back triangle,"" is a powerful submission technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). It is often employed when opponents turn their backs, allowing them to lock in this effective chokehold.
One must first secure control over the opponent from behind to execute this manoeuvre. This is typically achieved by wrapping your arms around the opponent's torso, with your chest against their back. The next step involves slipping one leg under the arm of the opponent and over their shoulder, creating a triangle with your legs around their neck and one arm.
In a rear triangle choke, you must have your legs positioned correctly. One leg should be under the opponent's armpit and across their chest, while the other should be hooked over your ankle or shin to secure the hold. This forms a tight 'triangle' around the neck and arm of your adversary.
Once this position is secured, pressure can be applied by pulling down on the head or squeezing your thighs together. This cuts off blood flow from the carotid arteries to the brain through a mechanism similar to other chokes in BJJ, leading to dizziness and eventual unconsciousness if not released.
However, accomplishing a rear triangle choke requires more than physical strength; it demands precision, timing, and a tactical understanding of BJJ principles. The most common mistake while attempting this hold is not securing it tightly enough - allowing for gaps that give an opponent room to escape.
Another critical aspect of executing a successful rear triangle choke involves managing balance. Maintaining stability becomes crucial because you are on your back with your opponent above you during this move. Any shift in weight or loss of balance could provide an opening for your adversary to break free.
The rear triangle choke is both an offensive move for submission and a defensive strategy when caught in precarious positions during a match. Its versatility makes it an indispensable tool in any BJJ practitioner's arsenal.
It's important to note that, like any other technique in BJJ, mastery comes with practice. Regular drilling and application during sparring sessions will help solidify this move into muscle memory - allowing for quicker and more efficient execution during actual combat situations.
Breaking Down the BJJ Triangle from Back
The BJJ Triangle from Back, or the rear triangle choke, is a potent submission technique that can be executed when positioned behind your opponent. This move is similar to the traditional BJJ triangle, with the primary difference being its orientation.
To execute this technique effectively, you must control your opponent's upper body while behind them. The main goal is to pass one of your legs under the armpit of your adversary and over their shoulder, creating a ""leg loop"" around their neck. Your other leg then locks over your ankle or foot, forming a triangle shape with your legs - hence the name 'triangle choke.'
Once this position is established, it's time for you to apply pressure. You do this by squeezing your thighs together and pulling down on the back of your opponent's head using both hands. This will force their shoulder into one side of their neck. At the same time, your thigh applies pressure on the other side, effectively cutting off blood flow from both carotid arteries in the channel.
One key point to remember about executing a successful BJJ triangle from the back is that it requires precision rather than brute strength. It's all about applying pressure in the right places and leveraging your body position correctly - not merely trying to overpower your opponent.
A common mistake beginners often make when attempting this move is failing to secure their hold tightly enough, which allows their opponents an opportunity to escape. To avoid this pitfall, lock in your hold securely before applying pressure.
Another important aspect is patience. The BJJ Triangle from Back isn't always an instant win. Sometimes, the chokehold effect may take several seconds to kick in fully and force an opponent into submission.
Lastly, practice makes perfect! Mastering the rear triangle choke will require repetitive drilling and consistent training sessions like any other BJJ technique. So don't get discouraged if you don't nail it on the first few tries; keep practising and refining until it becomes second nature.
In conclusion, breaking down the BJJ Triangle from Back reveals a complex but highly effective submission technique that combines precision positioning with targeted pressure application. Understanding and mastering this move can significantly enhance your BJJ arsenal.
When to Use a Triangle Choke?
The Triangle Choke is a versatile submission technique used in various scenarios during a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) match. The decision of when to use this chokehold largely depends on the position and movements of your opponent.
One of the most common situations for using a triangle choke is when you are in the guard position, particularly the closed guard. Suppose your opponent places one hand on the mat or attempts to strike. In that case, it allows you to apply the jiu-jitsu triangle.
Another scenario is controlling your opponent's arm from the bottom position. In this case, you can create an angle and lock their arm and neck using your legs, leading to a successful triangle hold.
The leg chokehold also comes into play when your opponent tries to pass your guard. As they try to move around your legs, it creates an opening for you to wrap one leg around their neck while using the other leg as leverage to secure the choke.
Moreover, you can apply a rear triangle choke if you find yourself behind your opponent due to a takedown or sweep. This involves wrapping your legs around your upper body from behind and securing one arm within the triangle for an effective choke.
Timing is crucial in all these situations. You must anticipate your opponent's moves and react quickly before they have time to defend or escape. In BJJ, being proactive rather than reactive often leads to success.
Remember that every match is different, so strategy and technique application flexibility is critical. Continually assess whether a triangle choke is feasible, given your current position and strength relative to your opponent's defensive moves.
Lastly, remember that practice makes perfect - drilling these techniques regularly will enhance recognition of opportunities for applying a successful triangle submission during matches.
Identifying Opportunities for a Jiu-Jitsu Triangle
In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), identifying opportunities to execute a triangle choke is crucial for gaining an advantage over your opponent. The triangle choke, or the jiu-jitsu triangle, is a powerful submission technique that can be applied from various positions and situations in a match.
One of the most common scenarios where you can apply this technique is when you're on your back, and your opponent is on your guard. This position allows you to control your opponent's arms while using your legs to apply pressure on their neck, creating the classic triangle chokehold.
Another situation where the jiu-jitsu triangle becomes beneficial is when you're in an open-guard scenario. Suppose you manipulate one of your opponent's arms between your legs while keeping the other arm outside. In that case, it opens up an opportunity for a triangle choke.
The key here lies in controlling and isolating one of your opponent's arms while simultaneously positioning yourself for the choke. One way to achieve this is by using a combination of sweeps and submissions that force your opponent into making defensive moves that expose them to the triangle.
Moreover, during scrambles or transition periods, there are often short windows where a well-timed triangle can be launched. For instance, when an opponent attempts to pass guard or during mid-sweep scenarios.
However, it's essential to identify these opportunities and act on them swiftly and accurately. A delay in application or incorrect execution could turn a potential submission into a disadvantageous position.
In summary, identifying opportunities for a jiu-jitsu triangle involves:
Understanding different BJJ positions and transitions.
Recognizing openings provided by an opponent's movements or reactions.
Executing swiftly with accurate technique.
Recognizing these moments requires practice and strategic thinking - knowing how each move works and when it will be most effective.
Timing and Application of the Leg Chokehold
The timing and application of the leg chokehold in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a critical aspect that can determine the success or failure of this submission technique. It requires physical strength, strategic thinking, and a deep understanding of your opponent's movements.
Firstly, it's essential to understand that the leg chokehold, often called the triangle choke, is not a move you can apply at any time during a match. It demands specific conditions that create an opportunity for its successful application.
One such condition is when your opponent leaves an arm inside your guard while attempting to pass it. This situation provides an ideal opportunity for you to trap their arm and head using your legs, setting up the triangle choke. Another scenario could be when you can obtain complete control over one of your opponent's arms during a scramble, allowing you to swing your legs up and lock in the triangle.
The timing of applying this move is equally crucial. The most compelling moment to lock in a triangle choke is when your opponent is off-balance or distracted, perhaps focusing on escaping another submission attempt or trying to improve their position.
In terms of application, there are several key steps:
Control of Opponent's Arm: You must first control one of your opponent's arms while keeping them within your guard.
Leg Placement: Swing one leg over the back of your opponent's neck while keeping hold of their trapped arm.
Locking In: Your other leg should come across the back of the first leg's ankle, effectively locking in the triangle.
Squeeze: Lastly, apply pressure by squeezing your thighs together while pulling down on your head.
Remember that practice makes perfect - drilling these movements regularly will help you identify opportunities faster and execute precisely during live sparring sessions or competitions.
Finally, remember that BJJ is about efficiency rather than brute force; thus, applying excessive strength in a poorly timed or positioned triangle choke may lead to failure and potential injury. Always prioritize technique and timing over power for this intricate submission move to be effective.
Anatomy of a Successful Triangular Choke
A successful triangular choke combines precise technique, correct positioning, and appropriate timing. This technique's anatomy involves using your legs and arms in a unique configuration that can lead to an effective submission move.
The leg triangle choke, often referred to, begins with one leg under the opponent's neck, with the ankle resting on the knee of your other leg, which is positioned across the back of your opponent's shoulders. This forms a triangle shape, hence the name. Your legs apply pressure on both sides of your opponent's neck, cutting off blood flow from the carotid arteries to the brain.
In addition to this, your arm plays a vital role in securing and tightening the choke. The component should be pulling down on their head while pushing up with your hips. This adds more pressure to their neck and helps secure them in place.
Here are some key aspects that contribute to a successful triangular choke:
Proper Positioning: You must position yourself correctly before attempting a triangle choke. Being off-centre or misaligned can make it easier for your opponent to escape.
Securing Your Legs: Once you have locked your legs into position around your opponent's neck and arm, it's crucial that you maintain this hold securely. Any loosening could allow them to break free.
Applying Pressure: The effectiveness of a triangle choke lies in its ability to cut off blood flow by applying pressure on both sides of the neck. Therefore, applying enough pressure using both legs and arms is critical.
Maintaining Control: Throughout all this, maintaining control over your opponent is necessary so they don't escape or counter-attack.
Patience: Lastly, patience is required as a triangle choke might take time before submission, depending upon the opponent's resistance level.
Understanding these aspects will provide insights into how each component contributes towards executing perfect jiu-jitsu triangle chokes effectively.
Role and Impact of the Leg Choke Hold in BJJ
The leg choke hold, or the triangle chokehold, is a critical Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) component. It involves using your legs to apply pressure around your opponent's neck, essentially turning your lower body into a vice. This technique can be effective in offensive and defensive situations, making it an essential part of any BJJ practitioner's arsenal.
It would help if you established a secure position to execute a successful leg choke hold. This typically involves wrapping one leg around the opponent's neck while the other leg locks it. The effectiveness of this move relies heavily on proper positioning and leverage rather than brute strength.
The impact of this hold is twofold: it restricts blood flow to the brain and limits air supply, causing light-headedness, confusion, and ultimately unconsciousness if not released in time. It's important to note that while this move can be dangerous if misapplied or held for too long, it is generally considered safe within the controlled environment of BJJ training or competition.
One key advantage of the leg choke hold is its versatility. It can be applied from various positions, including guard, mount, and side control - even from your back if you're skilled enough. This makes it a highly adaptable weapon that can catch opponents off guard.
Another significant benefit is its efficacy against larger opponents. Since the triangle chokehold relies on technique rather than power, even smaller practitioners can successfully apply this move against larger adversaries. Many BJJ fighters have used this technique to turn size disparities into an advantage by using their opponent's size against them.
Finally, mastering the leg choke hold also improves overall grappling skills. It enhances body awareness, coordination, and understanding of leverage – all fundamental aspects of BJJ.
In conclusion, understanding and mastering the leg choke hold in BJJ offers significant advantages - versatility across different positions, effectiveness against bigger opponents, and improved grappling skills overall. Therefore, investing time in practising this technique will undoubtedly pay dividends in enhancing your BJJ performance.
Reading the Triangle Choke Diagram
The triangle choke diagram is a visual representation that breaks down the complex sequence of movements involved in this BJJ technique. It provides a step-by-step guide on executing a triangle choke, making it an essential tool for beginners and experienced practitioners.
In the diagram, you'll typically see two figures: one representing the attacker (the person executing the triangle choke) and the other symbolizing the defender (the individual to whom the choke is being applied). The figures are usually depicted in different stages of movement to illustrate each step of performing the choke.
The first stage usually shows how to initiate a leg triangle. This involves positioning one leg over your opponent's shoulder and under their opposite arm, forming a triangle with your legs. Your second leg then wraps around your neck, creating a chokehold.
Next, you'll see how to control your opponent's posture by touching their head. This is often referred to as a triangle headlock. This part of the diagram highlights the importance of maintaining control throughout the execution of this move.
Following this, there's a demonstration of securing your position by locking your ankles or feet together while keeping your legs tight. This helps maintain pressure and prevent escape attempts from your opponent.
Finally, there's an illustration of applying pressure to complete the choke. Here, you'd pull down on your opponent's head while squeezing your thighs together, thereby cutting off blood flow from their carotid arteries, leading to unconsciousness if not released.
Remember that diagrams are only guides; they can't fully capture all nuances involved in executing these moves. Practice under the supervision of experienced instructors is crucial for mastering techniques like triangle chokes in BJJ. Diagrams are handy references but should be used alongside proper training for best results.
Analyzing Different Positions for a Perfect Leg Triangle Choke
In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), the leg triangle choke is a popular and effective submission technique. To execute this move, it's crucial to understand the different positions that can lead to a perfect leg triangle choke.
One of the most common setups for the leg triangle choke is from the guard position. Here, your opponent is in between your legs while you're on your back. With one arm inside your legs and one outside, you can manoeuvre your legs to lock a triangle around their neck and arm, applying pressure to cause them to submit or even lose consciousness.
Another setup is from the mount position. This requires more skill and agility as you need to transition from being on top of your opponent to underneath them while locking in the triangle. However, it can be very effective due to the element of surprise.
The side control position also offers opportunities for a leg triangle choke. Suppose you can trap one of your opponent's arms between your legs while maintaining side control. In that case, you can transition into a mounted triangle or roll onto your back to finish with a standard triangle choke.
A less standard but still viable setup is from back control. If you have back control and manage to trap one of your opponent's arms with your leg, you can transition into what's known as a 'back triangle.'
Remember that each position requires its unique approach regarding body movement and leverage. For example, when executing a leg triangle choke from the guard, use both hands to push one of your opponent's arms inside while simultaneously raising your hips off the ground and locking up the triangle with both legs.
In contrast, setting up a leg triangle choke from the mount requires swiftly transitioning from the top position to underneath without losing control over your opponent – an action demands quick reflexes and precise timing.
Remember: practice makes perfect. The more time spent drilling these positions and transitions, the more natural they feel during live sparring sessions or competitions.
Understanding these positions will enhance how effectively you apply a leg triangle choke and improve overall grappling skills by providing insights into positional control and transitions within BJJ.
The headlock is a critical component of an effective triangle chokehold in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). It's not just about trapping the opponent's head with your legs; it's also about using your arms effectively to make the choke tighter and more efficient.
Securing a good headlock is the first step in executing a successful triangle chokehold. This involves wrapping one arm around the opponent's neck, ensuring that their head is snugly fitted into the crook of your elbow. The other hand grabs your wrist, creating a secure and tight grip around the opponent's neck. This position restricts the movement of the opponent's head, making it harder for them to escape from the hold.
You can implement the leg triangle once you have secured a solid headlock. The leg triangle involves placing one leg over your opponent's shoulder while keeping their trapped arm inside—your other leg locks onto your ankle, forming a triangle with your legs.
However, an excellently executed leg triangle could only succeed with a solid head. The reason is simple: if your opponent can move their head freely, they can create enough space to breathe or even slip out of the choke entirely.
Therefore, mastering the art of securing an effective headlock in BJJ is crucial for any practitioner who wants to execute a triangle chokehold successfully. It serves as a control point and an anchor for applying pressure during chokes.
In conclusion, while many focus on perfecting their leg positioning when learning to do a triangle chokehold in BJJ, equal attention should be given to mastering an effective headlock. After all, it forms an integral part of this submission technique and significantly increases its success rate when applied correctly.
Executing a perfect jiu-jitsu triangle choke is all about precision, timing, and understanding the mechanics behind the move. It's not merely about power; it's a technique that uses your opponent's strength against them.
The first step in performing an effective triangle choke is to control your opponent's posture. This can be done using your hands or arms to break their balance and bring their upper body forward. The next step is securing one of your opponent's arms while simultaneously swinging your leg over their shoulder.
Next, you need to lock your legs in the triangle hold position. Your ankle should be directly behind the knee of your other leg, creating a closed circuit around your opponent's neck and trapped arm. Ensure that one of his shoulders is inside this loop while the other is outside.
Once you have locked in the triangle chokehold, it's time to apply pressure. You do this by pulling down on the back of your opponent's head while simultaneously elevating your hips. This action constricts blood flow from the carotid arteries to the brain, causing dizziness and potentially leading to unconsciousness if maintained.
However, remember that every opponent will react differently when caught in a triangle choke. Therefore, flexibility and adaptability are key when executing this move - be prepared to adjust your positioning or switch tactics entirely based on their response.
It is also important to remember that practice makes perfect. The more you train and execute this move, the more automatic it will become during live sparring sessions or competitions. Regular drilling can help you understand its intricacies better, increase the speed of execution, and improve overall effectiveness.
In conclusion, mastering a perfect jiu-jitsu triangle choke requires understanding its mechanism thoroughly and regular practice for honing skills and improving reflexes under pressure.
To enhance your skills on a triangle choke, it's crucial to understand its underlying mechanism. The triangle choke, or the ""triangular choke,"" is a submission technique that primarily uses your legs to exert pressure on your opponent's neck, leading them to tap out or lose consciousness.
The fundamental principle behind the triangle choke lies in cutting off blood flow to the brain by applying pressure on both sides of the neck. This is achieved by positioning one of your legs across the opponent's neck, with their shoulder pressing against the other side of their neck due to your leg pressure.
Here are some essential steps that can help you improve:
Positioning: Start from a closed guard position, where you control your opponent using both legs and arms.
Control: Break down your opponent's posture and control one arm, pushing it between their legs.
Leg Movement: Lift one leg high on the back of the opponent's shoulder while maintaining a grip on their arm and head.
Locking In: Swing your other leg up and lock it with the first leg at ankle level behind their back.
Adjustment: Adjust yourself so you're perpendicular to your opponent with their trapped arm directed towards their far hip across their body.
Squeeze: Apply pressure by squeezing your thighs together while pulling down on your head for added pressure.
Learning to execute a proper triangle choke involves understanding these steps thoroughly and constant practice and adjustments based on different opponents' reactions. Knowing what each step entails and why it works is also essential. This understanding can significantly enhance your ability to apply this effective submission technique in BJJ.
Remember that correct execution of this move requires precision more than strength; hence, understanding its mechanism is critical for successful application during sparring or competition situations in BJJ.
In essence, mastering the triangle choke comes down to three main factors: positioning, control, and adjustment – all underpinned by a clear comprehension of how this powerful technique functions at its core.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the Triangle Choke in BJJ is not just a sophisticated technique but an essential tool in the arsenal of any seasoned practitioner. Every aspect is crucial, from understanding its origins and functionality to mastering the step-by-step process of executing one. It's all about controlling your opponent using your legs, creating a chokehold restricting blood flow to the brain, resulting in a swift victory.
Whether from the back or front, using an arm triangle or leg chokehold, seizing the right moment for execution is critical. Moreover, reading and interpreting a triangle choke diagram can significantly enhance your understanding of this technique and its numerous variants, such as rear triangle choke, triangular choke, or jiu-jitsu triangle choke.
Remember that perfecting this move goes beyond knowing ""how"" and recognizing ""when."" The timing of applying this technique could be as decisive as its accurate execution. Mastering these intricate elements of the BJJ Triangle with practice and patience will elevate your defensive game and transform you into a formidable competitor on the mat.

A 101 guide to one of the most versatile and powerful BJJ submissions.
The triangle choke, or sankaku-jime in judo, is a popular stranglehold that can be seen in Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ), judo, grappling, and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) competitions. It is one of the most versatile and efficient submissions. There’s no clear origin of the triangle stranglehold, though it was prevalent in early judo competitions. The front triangle is the most popular version of this move, commonly used in BJJ and MMA.
This guide aims to give you an overview of the triangle mostly based on concepts from John Danaher’s excellent Triangles: Enter The System instructional. It will cover different variations of the move and give you an overall system in which they coexist. Additionally, we will cover various entries to the position and critical details that make this one of Brazilian jiu-jitsu’s best submissions. At the end of the article, we will discuss the history of the triangle and give you additional resources to study this technique.
What Is the triangle choke?
In Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the triangle choke stands out as one of the most effective and versatile submission holds. It is a strangle that can be used from almost any position, and there are many ways to apply it. There are several main variations of the triangle, such as the front triangle, the opposite side triangle, the rear triangle, the side triangle, and the reverse triangle.
The common element in all triangle attacks is that the attacker’s legs are locked in a triangular, figure-four pattern around the head and one arm of the opponent. This can produce an efficient strangling effect by utilizing the attacker’s legs and the opponent’s shoulder to cut off the blood flow through the carotid arteries. Cutting off the blood flow to the brain, blood chokes cause an opponent to submit or go unconscious.
There are many reasons why someone should become a master of triangles. It is a submission that can be well adapted to both gi and no-gi competitions. Also, it is great for mixed martial arts. Let’s examine some benefits of learning the triangle and why you should emphasize it heavily.
Why you should learn the triangle choke
Developing a new skill in Brazilian jiu-jitsu can take a lot of time. Some techniques may need weeks or even months for you to become good at them. Because of this, you should work on techniques that can be used in many situations. It is clear that the triangle is amongst the most versatile of all the submission holds we use. There are a large number of scenarios in which we can use it. It works equally well in grappling and fighting, with or without the gi, and it works well across all weight categories. This versatility is one of its primary appeals.
Developing athletes should consider strangleholds rather than joint locks when mastering a submission. This is because, in some extreme situations, such as a competition, some athletes are prepared to take severe damage to their joints and continue fighting. However, in the case of strangleholds, no amount of courage or mental toughness will save you from going unconscious. Therefore, strangleholds are usually better than joint locks when a choice has to be made between them.
Another reason why you should emphasize triangles is skill development. Triangles require us to develop an extraordinary degree of leg dexterity and coordination, much more so than regular submission holds. These attributes of leg dexterity and coordination can be beneficial in other areas of jiu-jitsu.
Jiu-jitsu is a sport where we should use our legs to wrestle the opponent’s upper body whenever possible. The triangle is an ideal example of this. Every triangle is a fight of our legs and hips against our opponent’s arm, head, and shoulders. By matching the strength of our lower body with the strength of our opponent’s upper body, we can overcome and defeat bigger and stronger opponents. The triangle is one of the best weapons for smaller and weaker athletes to take on and defeat larger adversaries.
How to do a triangle choke
It is best to learn and teach submissions in Brazilian jiu-jitsu by taking a systematic approach. When we look at the triangle, we can see that the best way to do a triangle is to follow a certain 4-step method, split into two stages.
The first stage of a triangle is entering the so-called “trap” triangle. A trap triangle is a lock around our opponent’s shoulder and neck, which looks like a closed guard.
From that form of control, we can move on to the second stage and convert it into a figure-four triangle that can strangle our opponent. If the triangle isn’t enough to finish the job, we must be prepared to switch to other forms of attack.
This two-stage approach is greatly described in John Danaher’s “Triangle: Enter the system” DVD. Let’s examine this two-stage approach and go over the four essential steps of performing a triangle strangle.
The first step in this two-stage system is to create the critical one-in/one-out scenario, which makes all triangles possible. For any triangle to work, we must trap one of our opponent’s arms and head with our legs. All triangles have this in common. We create these scenarios utilizing proper grips and off-balancing (kuzushi).
When grappling or fighting against a resisting opponent, we should always seek to get some kind of a dominant grip. There are various forms of grips we can use. For example, we can use the 2-on-1 or the collar & sleeve grip if we are fighting in a gi. They are great tools to off-balance our opponent. The essential off-balance criteria we want to have when looking for a triangle is for our opponent to post his hand on the mat. This is an ideal scenario from where we can hunt triangles.
Once our opponent is out of balance, we can move on to the second step in the first stage, which is shooting for a trap triangle. A trap triangle is an initial lock on our opponent that looks like a closed guard around our opponent’s one arm and head. Strangling is not the goal here; it is all about controlling and breaking our opponent’s posture. There are two main methods to achieve a trap triangle:
We must be adept at entering trap triangles through both methods to become masters of triangles.
Step number three of this system is to manage the adjustment from a trap triangle to the complete figure-four triangle. This represents the second stage of triangle application, the so-called strangulation phase. To achieve this transition, we need to create a proper angle and work on eliminating the shoulder of our opponent. Many times the system will get completed at this stage. However, there will be many times when we cannot finish the strangulation phase. If this happens, we must proceed to the fourth step.
If the triangle proves to be inadequate, for whatever reason, then we switch to joint locks. We have two choices here; we can go after our opponent’s arms, where the most popular choices are straight armlock (juji-gatame) and kimura attacks.
In addition, we can attack the lower body, especially if our opponent decides to stand up, which is a common defense. In these situations, we quickly transition to various forms of ashi-garami (leg entanglement) and attack with strong leg attacks.
Variations of the triangle choke
The triangle system is based around John Danaher’s five different forms of the triangle. When most people talk about triangles, they usually only refer to one triangle – the front triangle. However, we should never forget that there are five variations that we can use in ground fighting, and they are split into two categories:
Category A
Category B
Within each of these categories, whenever you have one form of triangle, you can easily switch to the other as a follow-up attack. For example, if you have a front triangle, you can quickly switch to the opposite side triangle by changing the lock of your legs.
Category A
This is the most popular form of the triangle, and most people are familiar with it. It can be used from the top and bottom positions and is the most important in the system.
There are many ways to get into the front triangle. Some entries can be done from the guard position, such as closed guard entries. However, front triangles can be easily set up from the top position, for instance, from mount or side control. When developing strong triangle attacks, the front triangle should be the primary focus of your training. Here is a great video of John Danaher explaining how to do a perfect front triangle:
The second triangle variation is the opposite side triangle, a move that has been underused in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The opposite side triangle was made popular by Gordon Ryan in his match against Ralek Gracie. Gordon used this variation to finish the fight and counter Ralek’s defensive reactions. You can see the match below:
The opposite side triangle can be used when the opponent defends the front triangle by overhooking your leg, thus preventing you from moving to a perpendicular angle. In this situation, transitioning to the opposite side is a great way to strangle your opponent. You should underhook the leg, invert, and lock your legs below your opponent’s trapped shoulder. This will make a tight choke even when your opponent defends appropriately.
The third triangle in category A is the rear triangle. This variation has become very popular recently and is mainly used from the back position. It complements the straitjacket back attack system and has a lot of value in modern jiu-jitsu.
When attacking with this form of the triangle, the critical element is to have your opponent’s arm extended over his head and his elbow on your chest. In addition, this is a great position to attack your opponent’s extended arm as there are armlock, Kimura, and Americana attacks. Take a look at the video where John Danaher shows some entries to the rear triangle:
Category B
The side triangle is the first triangle in category B. The move is often used in judo but has recently gained popularity in Brazilian jiu jitsu and grappling. The side triangle is usually performed from the top position or when attacking the turtle.
The best way to use the side triangle is to combine it with a kimura attack from the top. When these two attacks combine, it creates a dilemma for our opponent and often results in a submission. Here is a video of an entry to a side triangle from the top:
The last triangle in this system is the reverse triangle. It is a move that can be used both from the top and bottom and is often used when an opponent tries to escape from the side triangle. It became famous through Braulio Estima, who used it to finish Andre Galvao in their ADCC finals match.
What’s the difference between a regular triangle and an arm triangle?
The main difference between arm triangles and regular triangles is that arm triangles use the strength of our arms instead of our legs. Arm triangles involve techniques such as the kata gatame, anaconda, and darce. Since arm triangles don’t fall within the overall triangle system discussed in this article, they cannot be considered regular “triangles” and need to be looked at in depth separately.
How to make your triangle tight
A strong and tight triangle choke is a weapon everyone should have in their jiu jitsu arsenal. It is an attack that can lead you to victory if done right. A tight triangle requires us to solve some central problems during the application. Let’s go through some tips to make your triangle tighter and get you more taps.
One obstacle to fully locking a triangle is the circumference of your opponent’s shoulder and neck, especially if your opponent has broad shoulders.
To have a tight triangle, it’s essential to create the appropriate angle and ensure that your opponent’s shoulder is not inside the triangle. Position your free foot on your opponent’s hip, grab your lower leg, and then pivot so that you are across him. You should look directly into your opponent’s ear.
Once you have a good angle, you should work on removing his shoulder from the triangle. Your knee should be positioned on the shoulder within the triangle. Push yourself until the shoulder is no longer inside the triangle. It is important that your feet are pointing the same way, across your opponent. From this position, you can lock a full triangle and go for the finish!
Here’s a video from Lachlan Giles explaining how to eliminate larger opponent’s shoulder from the triangle:
When you get to the triangle, it is usually not a full triangle that will result in submission. Initially, you close a trap triangle, which resembles a control similar to the closed guard, but only with your opponent’s head and one arm inside. After that, you transition to a full triangle and finish the choke. These are the two stages every triangle has. This transition can be exploited by a skilled opponent by posturing up and escaping. It is important to avoid this by using one of the methods below.
In this demonstration from Rener Gracie, he explains that breaking your opponent’s posture to prepare for the triangle should happen early as soon as you sense they’re getting ready:
Underhooking the leg opposite the arm inside the triangle will help you create a proper angle and finish the strangle. Additionally, if you are fighting in an MMA fight or in a ruleset where slams are legal, this will prevent your opponent from slamming you and standing up. A great example of this can be seen in Khabib Nurmagomedov’s triangle victory over Justin Gaethje:
How to enter the triangle
In our earlier discussion, we mentioned the triangle’s versatility as one of its best features. As a result of its versatility, the triangle can be accessed from numerous positions. The story of every triangle is the same; it’s all about getting to that one in/one out scenario and then working towards the strangle!
Some of the best entries to the triangle come from the guard position, but we can also use entries from the top. Additionally, the triangle is a great way to counter single legs when our opponent tries to take us down.
The guard position is excellent for getting to the triangle. Whether you are using a gi or not, you can use many guard forms. The best guard positions to get to the triangle are the closed guard and the open guard. The closed guard gives you the necessary control of your opponent’s posture. Additionally, you can use many strong grips from the closed guard, such as the belt grip, collar grip, underhook, overhook, etc.
Alternatively, open guards such as the spider guard and the de la riva guard make your legs very mobile, so a trap triangle is easy to set up.
Dominant positions such as the mount, side control, and back control are excellent opportunities to hunt for triangles. From these positions, you can enter various forms of triangles, such as the front triangle, rear triangle, and side triangle.
One of the best ways to use the triangle is as a reversal, especially when our opponent goes for single leg takedowns. Single legs are a scenario where our opponent creates the much-needed one in/one out scenario for us. From there, we can reverse with front triangles, opposite side triangles, or side triangles.
How to defend a triangle choke
Attacking with triangles is a great skill, but you should know how to defend yourself if caught in one. First, you should not allow your opponent to get a perpendicular angle and eliminate your shoulder. This is best done by gluing your trapped elbow to the floor. From there, you can look to stand up and put pressure on your opponent, so he has to let go of the triangle. Here is a great escape from Andre Galvao you can watch:
History of the triangle choke
Numerous Brazilian jiu-jitsu and grappling moves have been around for a long time. There are ancient drawings of some techniques being performed thousands of years ago in ancient Pankration.
However, the triangle is a relatively new technique first used in Kosen judo at the start of the 20th century. In the book Choque: The Untold Story of Jiu-Jitsu in Brazil 1856-1949 by Roberto Pedreira, he claims the triangle was a judo technique actually inspired by two high school judokas in Japan.There is no evidence of the triangle being performed before that. The first version of the triangle choke created was the front triangle, and the side triangle was invented afterward. Many also believe that Masahiko Kimura developed this technique during a judo tournament. However, it is more probable that he just popularized it.
When Royce Gracie started fighting in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, he introduced the general audience to many techniques of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. One of his most memorable finishes was in his fight against Dan Severn, where he used the triangle to finish Severn, who was much larger than Royce at the time.
Another memorable use of the triangle was by Anderson Silva in his fight against Chael Sonnen. Silva was losing the fight by a long margin, but he managed to lock a front triangle at the end and win the fight.
The triangle was probably introduced to Brazilian jiu-jitsu by Rolls Gracie. According to Romero Cavalcanti, Rolls may have introduced the technique after reading a judo book. Márcio “Macarrão” Stambowsky, a pioneer of the triangle in BJJ and Rolls Gracie black belt has also credited Rolls.

The triangle choke is one of the most powerful and versatile submissions in BJJ.  Here’s 17 ways to set up and execute the triangle choke.
It’s my hope that from seeing the different ways to do the triangle choke, you’ll eventually develop a deeper, more thorough understanding of what the triangle choke is and how to do it!
Let’s get started!!
First, let’s talk about how to to finish the triangle choke.
Now, how do we get into this position?
Here’s 17 of my favourite ways to hit the triangle choke!
The triangle choke is one of the principle attacks from the guard. Starting in closed guard, you always want to break your partner’s posture down.  Once their hand is on the floor, you want to control their arm with an overhook.  Now look to get your knee on to the inside of their bicep, control their wrist; and then, throw your leg over to get the triangle position.
Getting the triangle with your leg circling the outside of your partner’s arm is started from overhooking your partner’s arm.  Next, control your partner’s free hand by grabbing all 4 fingers; and then, pull their hand underneath your guard; so, you can get the triangle position.
Although the omoplata is one of the most powerful submissions from the guard; like all attacks, nothing works all the time; and thus, we need to look at transitioning to other techniques.  When your partner starts to posture to defend the omoplata, pummel your leg over their far shoulder to get the triangle.
Personally, the kimura is my absolute favourite attack; but, it’s not only a submission, it’s a gateway to other techniques.  As your partner looks to defend your kimura, throw your leg over their far shoulder to get into the triangle position.
With a collar/sleeve grip on your partner, use your foot to check your partner’s bicep, when your partner fails to control your pant leg, you can now shoot your leg over their shoulder to get the triangle.
The double sleeve spider guard grip is one of the most powerful controls you can get on your partner.  Initiate your attack by first trying to sweep your partner with your foot on their bicep.  As they defend the sweep, kick your leg over their shoulder to enter into the triangle choke.
Leg Lasso is one of the best ways to control a fast moving, athletic partner from your spider guard.  But, unfortunately, as strong as the leg lasso control is, it can be tough to move directly into a submission.  What I recommend is a shallow leg lasso; meaning, just having your heel on your partner’s elbow; thus, enabling both a strong control of your partner; along with, a quick opening to a triangle choke when the moment arrises.
Sometimes, your butterfly guard sweep doesn’t lead directly into a sweep; but instead, creates an opening for additional attacks.  As you attempt your butterfly guard sweep; mostly likely, your partner will post their hand on the ground to defend the sweep; however, this opens your partner up for an immediate triangle choke.
Your butterfly guard is a very versatile guard that can lead to many separate sweeps and submissions; plus, attacking in a series of techniques is one of the best ways to finish your partner.  Look to initiate the sequence with a sweep, and as your partner defends the sweep by posting their arm out, you’re going to transition into a pressing armbar; and then, as the pressing armbar fails, you’re going to switch to a triangle choke as the final finishing technique.
Almost always when you’re fighting from half guard, your partner will be trying to control you with a cross face.  As your partner reaches with their arm for a cross face, this is your opportunity to attack with a pressing armbar.  However, when your pressing armbar fails because your partner is posturing up; then, this is the perfect opportunity to switch to a triangle choke.
Fighting from half guard is the fight for the underhook; however, when your partner wins the underhook, you can counter with an overhook armbar.  In most cases, your partner will defend your overhook armbar by posturing up; thus, allowing you to follow up with a triangle choke.
The over/under guard pass is one of the most dominate ways to get around the guard; however, this guard pass can be countered with a well timed triangle choke.
This is a sneaky triangle choke you can do from cross side once you have controlled your partner’s near arm. Bring your leg over your partner’s shoulder and as your partner attempts to sit up, they’ll fall perfectly into  your triangle choke.
When you’re able to bring your leg over your partner’s shoulder when you’re in mount; then, you can go for one of the most powerful triangle variations.  The key is to not only be perpendicular to your partner; but, as well, you want to only have one knee on the ground so your triangle choke can be as tight as possible.
Trapping your partner’s hands when you have their back is the proper procedure when going for a rear naked choke; however, as your partner tries to escape by sliding down towards your legs, they are now perfectly susceptible to a back triangle choke.
If you go for a 180 armbar; typically, one of your partner’s arms will be in between your legs.  If this happens, a quick and easy transition is to fall to the side for a triangle choke.
Your partner will almost always connect their hands to defend your armbar.  While there’s many ways to disconnect their hands, an easier solution is to sometimes kick your leg through for a triangle choke.

Arm triangle choke also called side choke, and head and arm choke is one of the most basic (and most effective) submission holds that you will learn in BJJ. The name of the move is the name of the game – you will need to triangulate your opponent’s throat and neck with your opponent’s arm and your own arm at the same time. There are several variations of this move and below you will read about how best you can implement this move in your BJJ game.
Arm Triangle Choke – Variations
Arm triangle choke from the mount
One of the most basic and most effective ways in which you can implement the arm triangle choke is from the mount position in which you’re sitting on top of your opponent. In this scenario, you will need to start the move by doing the so-called “captain hook” or putting your arm behind your opponent’s neck. Be careful though because this will mean that you’re losing the opportunity to use your hooking arm for support, so your opponent can notice this and sweep you off to bottom guard.
Once you’re done setting up the captain hook, you will need to isolate your opponent’s opposite arm. You can use your other arm for this purpose – you can slowly but surely push your opponent’s arm upwards. Once you get to the point when his arm is on the level with his neck, you will need to block his arm with your head. And this creates the basic arm triangle choke mechanism – you use your opponent’s arm which you push in his neck with your head – and you use your other “captain hooking” arm to block off the other side of his neck. The pressure from both sides will stop the blood flow into his carotid arteries and he will go to sleep soon enough.
We advise you to learn this move by using one arm only in combination with your head – if you master this then it means that the entire move will be a lot easier for you to finish if you clasp your arms with the gable grip and use the additional force that you will generate in this way to create pressure on your opponent’s neck. After you have caught your opponent’s neck with the arm triangle, you need to jump to the side where you gable grip is, and start to rotate towards your opponent’s head. This will gradually increase the pressure on his neck and he will be forced to tap out.
Standing Arm triangle choke
Unlike its half guard counterpart, standing arm triangle choke is rare to see due to the difficulty of this move and better options from this position. Problem is that fighter must maintain some degree of strength which is hard unless we have opponent with the back next to the cage like in the case below:
choke from the side control
One variation of this move is made from the side control. Once again you will need to start things off by doing a captain hook underneath your opponent’s neck in side control. Now, you will need to wait and do a counter-attack maneuver. If your opponent uses his opposite arm to push your head and tries to irritate you in this way, then you can use your head to block off his arm on a level with his throat. As you remember, this is the exact same move from the previous paragraph – the sole difference is that now you will need to jump to the other side while holding the choke so that you will be able to apply the necessary force and finish your opponent off.
bottom half guard
Finally, there is a variant that you can try out if you’re in bottom half guard. Insert your arm around his arm and neck and set up the triangle with your other arm. Then you can use a bridge to destabilize your opponent and improve your arm triangle position – this will eventually lead to a tap out.
Arm triangle choke Defense
If you wish to defend the arm triangle choke, then you can use the simple “answering the phone” technique. This means that you can use your isolated arm to “answer the phone” so to speak – imagine like you’re talking on the phone. This move will create some space between your neck and your isolated arm and this may give you just enough space for you to be able to breathe. This is not a fool-proof method, however, and if you use it, make sure that you give your best shot to get out of this position.
Also, you can use your isolated arm to reach and grab your inner thigh of your leg at the same side. This too will create more space between your neck and arm and it will give you room to breathe. However, you need to act quickly and waste not a second in catching your thigh because it may be already too late for you to do this before you even know it.
The arm triangle is a very powerful technique that can be used at any skill-level in BJJ. It’s a basic and effective move, and we recommend you drill it until you master it.

A 101 guide to one of the most versatile and powerful BJJ submissions.
The triangle choke, or sankaku-jime in judo, is a popular stranglehold that can be seen in Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ), judo, grappling, and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) competitions. It is one of the most versatile and efficient submissions. There’s no clear origin of the triangle stranglehold, though it was prevalent in early judo competitions. The front triangle is the most popular version of this move, commonly used in BJJ and MMA.
This guide aims to give you an overview of the triangle mostly based on concepts from John Danaher’s excellent Triangles: Enter The System instructional. It will cover different variations of the move and give you an overall system in which they coexist. Additionally, we will cover various entries to the position and critical details that make this one of Brazilian jiu-jitsu’s best submissions. At the end of the article, we will discuss the history of the triangle and give you additional resources to study this technique.
What Is the triangle choke?
In Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the triangle choke stands out as one of the most effective and versatile submission holds. It is a strangle that can be used from almost any position, and there are many ways to apply it. There are several main variations of the triangle, such as the front triangle, the opposite side triangle, the rear triangle, the side triangle, and the reverse triangle.
The common element in all triangle attacks is that the attacker’s legs are locked in a triangular, figure-four pattern around the head and one arm of the opponent. This can produce an efficient strangling effect by utilizing the attacker’s legs and the opponent’s shoulder to cut off the blood flow through the carotid arteries. Cutting off the blood flow to the brain, blood chokes cause an opponent to submit or go unconscious.
There are many reasons why someone should become a master of triangles. It is a submission that can be well adapted to both gi and no-gi competitions. Also, it is great for mixed martial arts. Let’s examine some benefits of learning the triangle and why you should emphasize it heavily.
Why you should learn the triangle choke
Developing a new skill in Brazilian jiu-jitsu can take a lot of time. Some techniques may need weeks or even months for you to become good at them. Because of this, you should work on techniques that can be used in many situations. It is clear that the triangle is amongst the most versatile of all the submission holds we use. There are a large number of scenarios in which we can use it. It works equally well in grappling and fighting, with or without the gi, and it works well across all weight categories. This versatility is one of its primary appeals.
Developing athletes should consider strangleholds rather than joint locks when mastering a submission. This is because, in some extreme situations, such as a competition, some athletes are prepared to take severe damage to their joints and continue fighting. However, in the case of strangleholds, no amount of courage or mental toughness will save you from going unconscious. Therefore, strangleholds are usually better than joint locks when a choice has to be made between them.
Another reason why you should emphasize triangles is skill development. Triangles require us to develop an extraordinary degree of leg dexterity and coordination, much more so than regular submission holds. These attributes of leg dexterity and coordination can be beneficial in other areas of jiu-jitsu.
Jiu-jitsu is a sport where we should use our legs to wrestle the opponent’s upper body whenever possible. The triangle is an ideal example of this. Every triangle is a fight of our legs and hips against our opponent’s arm, head, and shoulders. By matching the strength of our lower body with the strength of our opponent’s upper body, we can overcome and defeat bigger and stronger opponents. The triangle is one of the best weapons for smaller and weaker athletes to take on and defeat larger adversaries.
How to do a triangle choke
It is best to learn and teach submissions in Brazilian jiu-jitsu by taking a systematic approach. When we look at the triangle, we can see that the best way to do a triangle is to follow a certain 4-step method, split into two stages.
The first stage of a triangle is entering the so-called “trap” triangle. A trap triangle is a lock around our opponent’s shoulder and neck, which looks like a closed guard.
From that form of control, we can move on to the second stage and convert it into a figure-four triangle that can strangle our opponent. If the triangle isn’t enough to finish the job, we must be prepared to switch to other forms of attack.
This two-stage approach is greatly described in John Danaher’s “Triangle: Enter the system” DVD. Let’s examine this two-stage approach and go over the four essential steps of performing a triangle strangle.
The first step in this two-stage system is to create the critical one-in/one-out scenario, which makes all triangles possible. For any triangle to work, we must trap one of our opponent’s arms and head with our legs. All triangles have this in common. We create these scenarios utilizing proper grips and off-balancing (kuzushi).
When grappling or fighting against a resisting opponent, we should always seek to get some kind of a dominant grip. There are various forms of grips we can use. For example, we can use the 2-on-1 or the collar & sleeve grip if we are fighting in a gi. They are great tools to off-balance our opponent. The essential off-balance criteria we want to have when looking for a triangle is for our opponent to post his hand on the mat. This is an ideal scenario from where we can hunt triangles.
Once our opponent is out of balance, we can move on to the second step in the first stage, which is shooting for a trap triangle. A trap triangle is an initial lock on our opponent that looks like a closed guard around our opponent’s one arm and head. Strangling is not the goal here; it is all about controlling and breaking our opponent’s posture. There are two main methods to achieve a trap triangle:
We must be adept at entering trap triangles through both methods to become masters of triangles.
Step number three of this system is to manage the adjustment from a trap triangle to the complete figure-four triangle. This represents the second stage of triangle application, the so-called strangulation phase. To achieve this transition, we need to create a proper angle and work on eliminating the shoulder of our opponent. Many times the system will get completed at this stage. However, there will be many times when we cannot finish the strangulation phase. If this happens, we must proceed to the fourth step.
If the triangle proves to be inadequate, for whatever reason, then we switch to joint locks. We have two choices here; we can go after our opponent’s arms, where the most popular choices are straight armlock (juji-gatame) and kimura attacks.
In addition, we can attack the lower body, especially if our opponent decides to stand up, which is a common defense. In these situations, we quickly transition to various forms of ashi-garami (leg entanglement) and attack with strong leg attacks.
Variations of the triangle choke
The triangle system is based around John Danaher’s five different forms of the triangle. When most people talk about triangles, they usually only refer to one triangle – the front triangle. However, we should never forget that there are five variations that we can use in ground fighting, and they are split into two categories:
Category A
Category B
Within each of these categories, whenever you have one form of triangle, you can easily switch to the other as a follow-up attack. For example, if you have a front triangle, you can quickly switch to the opposite side triangle by changing the lock of your legs.
Category A
This is the most popular form of the triangle, and most people are familiar with it. It can be used from the top and bottom positions and is the most important in the system.
There are many ways to get into the front triangle. Some entries can be done from the guard position, such as closed guard entries. However, front triangles can be easily set up from the top position, for instance, from mount or side control. When developing strong triangle attacks, the front triangle should be the primary focus of your training. Here is a great video of John Danaher explaining how to do a perfect front triangle:
The second triangle variation is the opposite side triangle, a move that has been underused in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The opposite side triangle was made popular by Gordon Ryan in his match against Ralek Gracie. Gordon used this variation to finish the fight and counter Ralek’s defensive reactions. You can see the match below:
The opposite side triangle can be used when the opponent defends the front triangle by overhooking your leg, thus preventing you from moving to a perpendicular angle. In this situation, transitioning to the opposite side is a great way to strangle your opponent. You should underhook the leg, invert, and lock your legs below your opponent’s trapped shoulder. This will make a tight choke even when your opponent defends appropriately.
The third triangle in category A is the rear triangle. This variation has become very popular recently and is mainly used from the back position. It complements the straitjacket back attack system and has a lot of value in modern jiu-jitsu.
When attacking with this form of the triangle, the critical element is to have your opponent’s arm extended over his head and his elbow on your chest. In addition, this is a great position to attack your opponent’s extended arm as there are armlock, Kimura, and Americana attacks. Take a look at the video where John Danaher shows some entries to the rear triangle:
Category B
The side triangle is the first triangle in category B. The move is often used in judo but has recently gained popularity in Brazilian jiu jitsu and grappling. The side triangle is usually performed from the top position or when attacking the turtle.
The best way to use the side triangle is to combine it with a kimura attack from the top. When these two attacks combine, it creates a dilemma for our opponent and often results in a submission. Here is a video of an entry to a side triangle from the top:
The last triangle in this system is the reverse triangle. It is a move that can be used both from the top and bottom and is often used when an opponent tries to escape from the side triangle. It became famous through Braulio Estima, who used it to finish Andre Galvao in their ADCC finals match.
What’s the difference between a regular triangle and an arm triangle?
The main difference between arm triangles and regular triangles is that arm triangles use the strength of our arms instead of our legs. Arm triangles involve techniques such as the kata gatame, anaconda, and darce. Since arm triangles don’t fall within the overall triangle system discussed in this article, they cannot be considered regular “triangles” and need to be looked at in depth separately.
How to make your triangle tight
A strong and tight triangle choke is a weapon everyone should have in their jiu jitsu arsenal. It is an attack that can lead you to victory if done right. A tight triangle requires us to solve some central problems during the application. Let’s go through some tips to make your triangle tighter and get you more taps.
One obstacle to fully locking a triangle is the circumference of your opponent’s shoulder and neck, especially if your opponent has broad shoulders.
To have a tight triangle, it’s essential to create the appropriate angle and ensure that your opponent’s shoulder is not inside the triangle. Position your free foot on your opponent’s hip, grab your lower leg, and then pivot so that you are across him. You should look directly into your opponent’s ear.
Once you have a good angle, you should work on removing his shoulder from the triangle. Your knee should be positioned on the shoulder within the triangle. Push yourself until the shoulder is no longer inside the triangle. It is important that your feet are pointing the same way, across your opponent. From this position, you can lock a full triangle and go for the finish!
Here’s a video from Lachlan Giles explaining how to eliminate larger opponent’s shoulder from the triangle:
When you get to the triangle, it is usually not a full triangle that will result in submission. Initially, you close a trap triangle, which resembles a control similar to the closed guard, but only with your opponent’s head and one arm inside. After that, you transition to a full triangle and finish the choke. These are the two stages every triangle has. This transition can be exploited by a skilled opponent by posturing up and escaping. It is important to avoid this by using one of the methods below.
In this demonstration from Rener Gracie, he explains that breaking your opponent’s posture to prepare for the triangle should happen early as soon as you sense they’re getting ready:
Underhooking the leg opposite the arm inside the triangle will help you create a proper angle and finish the strangle. Additionally, if you are fighting in an MMA fight or in a ruleset where slams are legal, this will prevent your opponent from slamming you and standing up. A great example of this can be seen in Khabib Nurmagomedov’s triangle victory over Justin Gaethje:
How to enter the triangle
In our earlier discussion, we mentioned the triangle’s versatility as one of its best features. As a result of its versatility, the triangle can be accessed from numerous positions. The story of every triangle is the same; it’s all about getting to that one in/one out scenario and then working towards the strangle!
Some of the best entries to the triangle come from the guard position, but we can also use entries from the top. Additionally, the triangle is a great way to counter single legs when our opponent tries to take us down.
The guard position is excellent for getting to the triangle. Whether you are using a gi or not, you can use many guard forms. The best guard positions to get to the triangle are the closed guard and the open guard. The closed guard gives you the necessary control of your opponent’s posture. Additionally, you can use many strong grips from the closed guard, such as the belt grip, collar grip, underhook, overhook, etc.
Alternatively, open guards such as the spider guard and the de la riva guard make your legs very mobile, so a trap triangle is easy to set up.
Dominant positions such as the mount, side control, and back control are excellent opportunities to hunt for triangles. From these positions, you can enter various forms of triangles, such as the front triangle, rear triangle, and side triangle.
One of the best ways to use the triangle is as a reversal, especially when our opponent goes for single leg takedowns. Single legs are a scenario where our opponent creates the much-needed one in/one out scenario for us. From there, we can reverse with front triangles, opposite side triangles, or side triangles.
How to defend a triangle choke
Attacking with triangles is a great skill, but you should know how to defend yourself if caught in one. First, you should not allow your opponent to get a perpendicular angle and eliminate your shoulder. This is best done by gluing your trapped elbow to the floor. From there, you can look to stand up and put pressure on your opponent, so he has to let go of the triangle. Here is a great escape from Andre Galvao you can watch:

In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, to control the head means to control the body. One of the key principles in BJJ is that wherever the head goes, the body follows. Head control is useful when passing the guard or securing a dominant position, and even more so in applying submissions. Attacking the head and neck using chokes from unusual positions can be an effective way to take a resisting opponent out. Today, we will talk about one of the most vicious chokes in BJJ, the bulldog choke.
What Is The Bulldog Choke?
At first glance, the bulldog choke is the choke an untrained person will most likely apply just by instinct alone. Somebody grabs them from behind with the opponent’s head low on their torso, and they more than probably hold the head as they barrage them with strikes using their free hand or even just squeeze with all their might. This is inefficient and puts an untrained person at risk as the opponent can slam them on the ground or take their back if their head control slips. This is why learning the proper choking mechanics and body positioning is critical to safely and effectively apply this choke to take your opponents out.
The bulldog choke is a powerful choke when applied correctly. It is a type of neck crank and may seem like a mix of a guillotine and a rear naked choke applied in the opposite direction, with your body in front of the opponent. Just like the guillotine and rear naked choke, it puts pressure on the carotid arteries of the neck. It can block the airflow depending on the positioning of the arms while applying the choke, making it like a combination of a blood choke (strangle) and an air choke.
This choke may appear risky and unconventional as it is applied with no hooks or wrapping your legs around the opponent, giving you no other control besides the head and neck. Though it may seldom work against a trained opponent, you can set it up by applying the choke just when you are about to lose back control to catch your opponents off guard, making it a viable option when you end up in the position. However, remember to always control your opponents when in a dominant position, as it is one of the main pillars of BJJ.
Bulldog Choke In Action
Before we learn how to apply the bulldog choke, let’s first see the choke being used in the highest level of competition. Ben Askren, a former Bellator and ONE Championship World Champion, submitted MMA legend Robbie Lawler in his crossover debut to UFC using the bulldog choke.
Ben is an accomplished grappler and former U.S. Olympic Wrestling Team member known for his unstoppable wrestling skills in the cage. After bringing Lawler to the fence, Ben managed to take him down while controlling Lawler’s hand and legs on the ground. As soon as Lawler turned away, looking to escape, he allowed Ben to maintain a chest-to-back connection with a seatbelt grip. Ben swiftly transitioned his choking arm using an S Grip.
While securing the choking grip, Lawler turned, trying to face Ben, putting Ben out of position. Remember that Ben has no hooks to secure the back mount. While controlling Lawler’s head using the choke with an S grip, Ben eventually lands in front of Lawler, which lands him in the position of the bulldog choke. Ben, known for having a grip enough to crush two watermelons with his arms, did not hesitate and quickly leaned his body forward and tightened up the choke to submit Robbie Lawler in the first round.
How To Perform The Bulldog Choke?
Although we mentioned earlier that the bulldog choke is like a mix of a guillotine and rear naked choke, be careful when using this choke with an RNC grip, as you can get flipped over. The idea of the bulldog choke from the back mount is if you have the seatbelt grip and the opponent tries to escape to your underhand side, you can initiate the bulldog choke.
Assuming that you have the back mount and on the underhand side of the seatbelt while controlling the opponent’s neck with your top arm (choking arm). The opponent will usually escape to the underhand side by turning that way with their shoulder to face your body. You can secure the position if you have your wrist grip on the opponent with your underhand. The wrist grip with your underhand stops them from turning their shoulder on your underhand side and makes it difficult for the opponent to turn their body down.
Keep your torso pressing on the opponent’s back while maintaining the wrist grip, as the opponent can scoot away and pull their arm out. A lot of times, the opponent might initiate a scramble by turning to your underhand side. When this happens, turn back up and lock your choking hand (top arm) with your underhand for the bulldog choke. You can do so by closing your hands with a Gable or S Grip. Once your grips are secured, finish the bulldog choke by sitting your legs out in front of the opponent’s body and leaning back on them.
Sprawling away prevents the opponent from closing the gap and helps block their attempt to shoot forward and attack with takedowns. Leaning back on the opponent gives you more leverage and enables you to apply stronger pressure, thus, making the choke tighter. While the bulldog choke is uncommonly seen in competitions, it is unstoppable when synced in properly.
Conclusion
The setup is critical in making the bulldog choke work. Not applying hooks when on the back mount forces the opponent to turn towards you, which you can use as bait. While it is mainly applied from the back mount when the opponent turns on your inferior (underhand) side, it would be best to work both sides. Be careful when doing the choke in training, and work on the proper execution of the technique to prevent injuries.

Bulldog Choke – BJJ Submission Explained In Details
When Ben Askren made his UFC debut, we all got a lot of entertainment, just like we expected. The fight did not begin Askren’s way, but it ended on his terms, albeit controversially. The end result was a victory against Robbie Lawler via a submission that came in the form of a rarely seen Bulldog Choke. This choke is something we all know, or think we know. Apart from strangling someone with hands on the neck, the Bulldog Choke is what most of us perceive as a choke or strangle before training BJJ. It is a move that’s rarely in the curriculum of gyms, and one that we almost never see in tournaments. However, Askren’s latest efforts got us thinking. Is the Bulldog choke a viable option in grappling, or was it simply down to chance?
In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, techniques come and go in waves. It goes something like this: Someone figures out or modifies a move, gets success with it, people pick it up and it becomes a hit. After a while, since everyone now knows the move, it loses its efficiency somewhat and slowly fades away. After a while though, most moves that at some point really worked, do get a revival. Up until a short while, we all thought leg locks didn’t work. Now, we’re scrambling for the latest instructional on the subject. So why would the bulldog choke be any different? In fact, it can turn into your secret weapon, if you’re the one to take it out of the drawer and start fine-tuning it first!
The Ben Askren Bulldog Choke
So, let’s go over what happened in that famous Ben Askren UFC debut. It is pointless to talk about spoilers since a couple of weeks have already gone by, but still, SPOILER ALERT. Now that that’s out of the way, let’s recap.
Ben Askren had some crazy statistics about being hit only a few times in his last dozen or so professional MMA fights. Former UFC champ Robbie Lawler quickly corrected those statistics by almost finishing Askren with strikes in the very first round. Askren proved that he has some chin on him, weathering the storm and going on offense late in the round. We all know how reliant Ben is on his wrestling, so it was no surprise to see him pin Lawler to the cage. While scrambling for position, it seemed that Askren got an opening for the back, but only managed to get a sort of a Rear Naked Choke in without the hooks. Where he needed up instead was to the side of a kneeling Robbie Lawler, still holding on to that choke, which Joe Rogan immediately recognized as the Bulldog choke.
When many people thought Askren has nothing, due to not having back control. Robbie’s arm went limp and the referee stopped the fight. The moment the two fighters got separated, it appeared Robbie was ok, and a controversy ensued. Still, it turned out to be a good stoppage, which means Askren’s Bulldog choke did the job.
If you’re interested in learning more about Askren’s funk wrestling style, make sure you get his “Ultimate Askren Wrestling” DVD instructional. It is a set of 8 DVDs that cover every possible aspect of wrestling intended for grapplers an MMA fighters. Check out a full review HERE.
Bulldog Choke Essentials
So, how does this infamous Bulldog choke work? It does defy the age-old BJJ mantra of position before submission, so how come it worked on a UFC world champion? There’s a reason why most kids reach for this move on playgrounds and during brawls. It comes naturally as it offers control over the head while breaking the opponent’s posture at the same time. As you’ll see, many BJJ principles are still applicable and are the foundation of this strangle.
The way the Bulldog choke works just like a Rear Naked Choke but without the figure four grip. It also does not require you to have hooks inside the opponent’s hips. All you need to make sure you get a really tight choke is to have the arm deep on the neck. You could pull off the choke even if you’re higher up on the chin. It might require Ben Askren-like grip strength, though! Now, once your arm is deep enough around the neck of a turtled opponent, you’re good to go. The grip here is the same as in a Guillotine, with your free hand over the palm of your choking arm and pulling upward.
Position-wise, to make sure you are stable and you have weight on the opponent, you need to have a solid base. In order to get it, you’ll need to do a sit-out to the front once you get the choking arm in. To make sure all your weight is on their head and neck, you’ll also bring your other leg forward, ending up in the “table” position. The position itself is enough to ensure the choke. However, you also have the option to squeeze with your arms for the tap.
Will it Work?
Why wouldn’t it? After all, the position for the Bulldog choke is not one that doesn’t offer submissions. In Gi Jiu-Jitsu, the clock choke works from the same position and with largely similar mechanics. In that sense, the Bulldog is essentially a No-Gi clock choke hybrid that includes some Rear Naked Choke and guillotine principles. Given that all these chokes are high-percentage submissions, the Bulldog choke can actually be a very successful strangle.
A very important aspect of this choke is weight distribution. It is extremely easy to go flying over the top of a turtled opponent. In order to make sure that doesn’t happen, you’ll need to keep your hips up in the air and heavy on your opponent. Moreover, you’ll need an anchor point until you set the choke up. This comes via a crucifix trap on the near side arm. Use your far side leg to trap the arm, just like for a crucifix position. Keep it there until you manage to get the choke in order to stay stable and prevent any escapes.
Once the choke is in and you have your grip, you’ll have to release the crucifix arm in order to do the sit-out. In terms of choke depth, the deeper the better. Still, if you end up on the chin, make sure you completely retract your shoulder blades once you are in a choking position. This will make the choke that much tighter and might even give it a crank aspect as well.
In Summary
The Bulldog choke might look like something out of old, B-list martial arts movies, but it is not. It is, in fact, a very viable Jiu-JItsu move that can be a very high percentage submission. All it takes is using some foundational BJJ principles to make sure the move has pristine mechanics. Apart from that, there’s no reason why the choke wouldn’t work. It is effective in both Gi and No-Gi, and against all levels of opponents.

In Jiu Jitsu, there are some techniques you look at and question the legitimacy of. You might say to yourself, when would I ever use that and why should I learn it?
Although even if you’ll never use it, you still need to know how to do it. Just so that it makes your Jiu Jitsu complete.
This is why we made this section to tell you everything about the bulldog choke. Breaking down everything from who came up with it, how it works, and detail how to execute the choke.
Contents
When was the bulldog choke created
Nobody really invented the bulldog choke. It has been a move people have been doing for centuries without any technique behind.
We’ve all seen schoolyard fights, where some grabs a headlock and starts hitting the other person. That is basically a crude version of what a bulldog choke is. People just know if you grab a hold of someone’s head you can control.
There’s numerous ancient paintings and sculptures of men locking in a bulldog choke onto bulls and lions.Noone can really be accredited with coming up with the move.
The bulldog choke is most taught within catch wrestling.  Some catch wrestlers prefer to forgo the process of getting back control with hooks and just attack the head. Going by the old adage control the head and the body will follow
How does the choke work?
While it may seem like an amateurish move that shouldn’t work, the bulldog choke works. When you do it properly the choke can be really tight. Your opponent will also feel really silly that they got caught with a bulldog choke.
The bulldog choke is basically a mix of an RNC with no hooks and a guillotine choke. It also looks a bit like a No-Gi clock choke. You clasp your arms around the opponent’s neck and cut off their blood flow. It is also a bit of an air choke.
In all honestly though, there is nothing nice about the bulldog choke. Once you see their neck is open it is a submission you grab and squeeze laying in crushing pressure.
Bulldog choke details
A lot of the bulldog choke setups come from various scrambles. We’ll get to that later, but for this section we’re just listing the steps of doing a bulldog choke.
Let’s say for whatever reason the opponent exposed their neck opening up the opportunity for a bulldog choke. First thing is your choke grip.
There’s three grip variations that are generally used depending on the setup and what’s available. Gable grip, RNC grip, and S grip.
Whichever one you choose remember this tip to slide your hand under the opponent’s chin. Put the back of your thumb against the side of their neck and slide it under their chin.
Once you secure your grip, sit your legs out to the side and lean into your opponent. You sit out away from them, because if they’re close they can defend and counter with a takedown.
Leaning on your opponent when doing a bulldog choke is important for two reasons. First it gives you leverage to make a tighter choke. The other reason it keeps them in place helps prevent them from defending.
You don’t see the bulldog choke often in competition because it is rather easy to defend. That is why you have to do each step perfectly if you’re going to go for it.
Ben Askren bulldog choke
The most recent use of the bulldog choke came in the Ben Askren vs Robbie Lawler UFC fight. It was a controversial stoppage, but the technique was legit.
In the fight, Askren took Lawler down and got back control for a moment. In that moment Askren got his hand under Lawler’s neck, but Robbie tucked his chin to defend.
Ben didn’t have proper hooks, so Robbie tried to turn away from Askren’s arm and attempt a single leg. When he did this it opened the opportunity for Askren to do a bulldog choke.
While he still had a grip around Lawler’s neck, Askren turned to the side, leaned in and squeezed.
Raquel Pennington bulldog choke
When Raquel Pennington did the bulldog choke, the set up came from standing against the fence. Pennington was controlling Asley Evans-Smith against the cage.
Smith tried to turn away, but exposed her neck and Pennington quickly capitalized. Grabbing a rear naked choke grip.
Although instead of going to Smith’s back, Pennington stepped forward and dragger her down by her head. Sitting out and locking in the bulldog choke.
Smith refused to step and tried to wait out the round, but fell asleep as the round ended.
Yancy Medeiros reverse bulldog choke
Another unlikely submission that you never see in fighting is the reverse bulldog choke. The only one that was pulled off in the UFC was by Yancy Medeiros.
Yancy got a standing guillotine choke on his opponent and for some reason they defended by turning into Medeiros. When they did this Yancy just kept his grip and turned it into a modified reverse bulldog choke.
A move you will hardly ever see, but it was effective.
Duck under to bulldog choke
This catch wrestling technique starts from standing when you’re in a double collar tie up with your opponent. You’re going to start by pushing the opponent back.
Naturally they’ll react by pushing back and this is what you want. As they push you back, you duck under them and go to the back.
You’re going to keep your collar tie and use it to pull them down. Next step is to replace your collar tie hand with your choke hand.
Slide your choke hand under their neck with the blade of your wrist under their chin. Then take an S grip and keep your elbows tucked in.
The final and most important step before you start your squeeze is the sit out.  It is very important when you sit out that you go past the opponent’s shoulder.
If you stay on the opponent’s shoulder, you’ll have to muscle in the choke and it isn’t likely you’ll get it. So always sit out past the opponent’s shoulder.
Now that you’re in position squeeze by pushing your elbows back and drive your wrist blade upward into their neck.
Bulldog choke setup option
This bulldog choke setup comes from when the opponent is in the turtle position staying tight. You’ve attempted getting hooks, but they just aren’t giving them up.
So there is a nasty catch wrestling bulldog choke you can set up. From the side of your opponent in the turtle, you’re going to do a crossface on them with your far arm.
Grind the blade of your wrist under their nose and forcibly lift their head up. This exposes their neck and you quickly wrap your other arm around their neck.
Take a knuckles down guillotine grip, sit out and get the submission.
Tips
As a grappler,  you’ll probably be able to count the times you’ll do a bulldog choke on both hands. While it isn’t likely you’ll hit this move often, you should still know how to do it.

What is a Suplex in Wrestling?
A suplex is a move in which the wrestler lifts their opponent off the ground and then slams them down onto the mat. It is considered a defensive move, as it can be used to turn the tide in a match by quickly reversing the momentum from one wrestler’s favor to another. Suplexes can also be used to set up a pin attempt, or they can be used as a finishing move when executed powerfully enough.
The history of the suplex dates back to the early days of pro wrestling, but it has remained a mainstay in modern wrestling as well as amateur wrestling due to its effectiveness and showmanship. Usually, the wrestler performing the suplex will take a few steps back and get some momentum before they lift their opponent up and slam them down.
Is It Legal to Suplex in Wrestling?
Yes, suplexes are legal in all forms of wrestling except folkstyle. However, there are certain variations that may be illegal depending on the particular ruleset of the organization in which you are wrestling. In amateur wrestling, for example, some suplexes are considered illegal because they involve too much risk of injury.
Suplex Types
There are different types of suplexes that can be performed depending on the situation. These include:
Women Wrestling Suplex
Women wrestling suplexes are often seen in mixed martial arts, but they can also be used to great effect in professional wrestling. Women wrestlers typically use the same types of suplexes as men wrestlers but may modify them slightly to take into account their smaller size and strength.
Women’s wrestling suplexes are often used to set up other moves or surprise opponents. An example of a woman wrestler who has mastered this is Ronda Rousey, who used the judo hip toss to her advantage during her championship run.
Olympic Wrestling Suplex
The suplex is also a move that is commonly used in Olympic wrestling. It was first used in the 1992 Summer Olympics and has been a staple in the sport ever since. Olympic wrestlers use a variety of suplexes to gain an advantage over their opponents, including back suplexes and belly-to-belly suplexes.
Freestyle Wrestling Suplex
Freestyle wrestling is a form of amateur wrestling that has been around since the late 19th century. The suplex is a common move in freestyle wrestling, and it is often used to gain an advantage over an opponent who might be on their back or in a vulnerable position. Freestyle wrestlers may also use suplexes as part of their defensive strategy or to set up pin attempts.
Judo Suplex
The judo suplex is a variation of the traditional suplex that was developed in Japan. In judo, the wrestler will use their opponent’s momentum to lift them up and then slam them onto the mat. This type of suplex is often used to set up other moves or to surprise an unsuspecting opponent. Judo suplexes are also used in mixed martial arts as a way to take an opponent down quickly and gain a dominant position.
WWE Suplex
The suplex is one of the signature moves used by professional wrestlers in WWE. It can be used as a finishing move, to set up pin attempts, or to turn the momentum of a match around in an instant.
The most common type of suplex seen in WWE is the German Suplex, but over the years wrestlers have adapted and innovated to create their own variations. Some of these variations include the Tiger Suplex, Superplex, Fisherman Suplex, Slingshot Suplex, and Inverted Suplex. WWE stars have also adapted the judo suplex to use in their matches, making it one of the most popular moves in professional wrestling.
Can You Suplex in Greco-roman Wrestling?
Yes, suplexes are commonly used in Greco-Roman wrestling. There are a few different types of suplexes that can be used, such as the single-leg suplex, double-leg suplex, and headlock suplex. These moves are often used to gain an advantage over an opponent or to set up other moves. Greco-Roman wrestlers will also use suplexes as a way to take an opponent down quickly and gain a dominant position.
Can You Suplex in BJJ?
No, suplexes are not allowed in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, as they involve slamming someone to the ground. However, there are a few techniques that are similar to suplexes, such as the hip toss and shoulder throw. These techniques can be used to gain a dominant position on the ground or to surprise an unsuspecting opponent.
What Makes Suplkex So Effective as a Finishing Move?
Suplexes are effective as a finishing move because they can be used to quickly and decisively take an opponent off their feet. This can often be enough to earn a pinfall victory in professional wrestling.
Suplexes also allow wrestlers to set up other moves, as they can be used to quickly transition from one move to another. As a result, suplexes are often used as a way to surprise opponents or to set up other powerful finishing moves. Finally, suplexes can be used to demonstrate a wrestler’s strength and dominance in the ring.
What Wrestler is Known for Suplex?
Brock Lesnar is known as one of the most formidable suplexes in professional wrestling. He has mastered a wide variety of suplexes, including the German suplex and belly-to-back suplex.
Lesnar is also known for his signature “F5” suplex, which is a variation of the German suplex. Lesnar has used his suplexes to win matches in WWE and other major promotions, making him one of the most successful wrestlers in history.
How to Perform a Suplex in Wrestling?
The proper technique for performing a suplex is essential for successful execution.
The first step is to get into a good position. This can be done by using an overlook, undertook, or collar tie. Once in the proper position, the wrestler should use their arms and legs to lift the opponent up off the mat.
Then, the wrestler should “slam” their opponent down by extending their arms and legs out as far as possible. It is also important to ensure that the opponent’s head and shoulders are the first parts of their body to hit the mat.
Finally, the wrestler should secure a pin attempt as soon as possible after completing the suplex. With practice, wrestlers can master the technique and timing needed to safely and effectively perform a suplex in wrestling.

Powerbomb
A powerbomb is a professional wrestling throw in which an opponent is lifted (usually so that they are sitting on the wrestler's shoulders) and then slammed back-first down to the mat.[1] The standard powerbomb sees an opponent first placed in a standing headscissors position (bent forward with their head placed between the attacking wrestler's thighs). The opponent is then lifted on the wrestler's shoulders and slammed down back-first to the mat.[1] A prawn hold is commonly used for a pinning powerbomb.
Powerbombs are sometimes used in mixed martial arts competitions, when a fighter attempts to slam another fighter who has him trapped in a triangle choke. In professional wrestling, it is also sometimes used by a bigger wrestler as a counter to an attempted hurricanrana by a smaller wrestler. While it was associated with super-heavyweight wrestlers, the move was invented by Lou Thesz.[2]
Variations[edit]
Argentine powerbomb[edit]
The wrestler first places their opponent face-up across their shoulders, as in an Argentine backbreaker rack, hooks the head with one hand and a leg with the other, and the wrestler will then spin the opponent's head away from them, dropping the opponent down to the mat. Often the wrestler drops to a seated position while spinning the opponent. Innovated by Lioness Asuka, who called it the Towerhacker Bomb and popularized by AJ Styles as the Rack Bomb.
Crucifix powerbomb[edit]
The wrestler places the opponent's head in between their legs, then grabs the opponent's stomach, lifts the opponent over their shoulder, and holds both their arms in a cross position over their head. The wrestler finally runs or falls to their knees and throws the opponent onto the mat back and neck first. Sheamus employs the running variation, dubbing it the Celtic Cross. The falling variation is often associated with Razor Ramon, who popularized the move; calling it the Razor's Edge (also known as the Outsider's Edge or Diamond's Edge during his time in WCW as Scott Hall and Diamond Studd respectively). Hall also (though rarely) used a version of this move with the opponent positioned on the second rope away from him. Damian Priest[3] uses the move as a tribute to Hall. The throwing variation is used by Bad Luck Fale who calls it the Bad Luck Fall, Hernandez who calls it the Border Toss, and Ethan Page who calls it the Ego’s Edge.
Also known as a Niagara Driver, Splash Mountain Bomb, or Black Tiger Bomb, this powerbomb is similar to the crucifix powerbomb, but instead of the wrestler falling forward to drop the opponent, the attacking wrestler falls to a seated position for a pinfall attempt instead of releasing the opponent. Innovated by Kyoko Inoue and popularized by Black Tiger. A top rope version was used by Konnan as well. It is used by Roman Reigns as a signature move.
Dangan bomb[edit]
This move, invented by Masato Tanaka, is performed when the wrestler will put the opponent in to the position for a belly to back suplex, lift them up and then catch them in mid air as if going for a spinebuster but instead put the opponents legs on their shoulders then drives the opponent to the mat like a falling powerbomb.
Multiple powerbomb[edit]
Due to convenience of wording, this name can refer to a maneuver either performed by two persons on one, or one person on two; generally both opponents will be far smaller than the wrestler attempting the move. One opponent is placed on the attackers shoulders as per a standard powerbomb, then the other will be placed on the first opponents shoulders, facing in the same direction. This is normally performed by putting the first opponent's head between the seconds legs while they are sitting on the second or top turnbuckle. Finally, both opponents will be slammed to the mat.
A variation this move is called triple powerbomb, and it is performed by three wrestlers. Two wrestlers lift an opponent with a belly-to-back hold and place the opponent's legs on the third partner's shoulders, who executes the powerbomb while the other two push the opponent from the carrying partner's shoulders. There is also an avalanche variation of this move performed from the middle rope. This was popularized by The Shield in WWE.
Double underhook powerbomb[edit]
Also known as a Tiger driver or Tiger bomb. The wrestler faces a bent over opponent, and hooks each of the opponent's arms behind the opponent's back. The wrestler then lifts the opponent in the air and flips them over, throwing them back down and driving the back and shoulders of the opponent to the ground. The wrestler may also fall to their knees as they slam the opponent down. A sitout version is commonly known as a Tiger Driver and was invented by Mitsuharu Misawa. Ahmed Johnson used the sitout version as well, calling it the Pearl River Plunge. Tyler Bate uses the move as his finishing maneuver, calling it the Tyler Driver '97 and Toni Storm calling it Storm Zero.
Another variation credited to Mitsuharu Misawa. In this version, the wrestler keeps the arm hooks applied during the entire move, causing their opponent to land on their head, neck, and shoulders. Misawa popularized the move as Tiger Driver '91'. The name refers to the January 29, 1991 match in which Misawa debuted the maneuver against Akira Taue.[4] Kota Ibushi uses this move as finishing move. Masahiro Chono used it as finishing move on rare occasions, most famously used to win the first ever G1 Climax. Will Ospreay also uses the move renamed it to the Storm Driver '93. It is rarely attempted due to the dangerous nature and risk factor of the move.
Elevated powerbomb[edit]
This move is similar to a standard powerbomb. Instead of slamming the opponent directly on the mat from the shoulders, the attacking wrestler first lifts the opponent even higher by holding onto the opponent and extending their arms up, lifting the opponent up off the shoulders of the attacking wrestler just moments before slamming them down to the mat. This move was used prominently by The Undertaker, who named it the Last Ride. A sitout version is used by Kota Ibushi, who calls it the Golden Star Bomb, and a pop up variation is used by Keith Lee, who calls it the Spirit Bomb as a homage to Dragon Ball Z.
Falling powerbomb[edit]
This move starts by lifting an opponent like a normal powerbomb, but when the opponent is on the wrestler's shoulders the wrestler falls forward, slamming the opponent onto the ground. This move was popularized by Kane.
Fireman's carry powerbomb[edit]
The wrestler lifts the opponent onto their shoulders, into the fireman's carry position. The wrestler grabs hold of the opponent's near leg with one hand, and their head with the other, then pushes the opponent's upper body up and simultaneously spins them, causing them to end up in front of the wrestler face up. The wrestler then either sits down or stays standing. They may also wrap their hands around the opponent's upper legs.
Folding powerbomb[edit]
The move sees the wrestler lifts the opponent and drops them on the mat, while sliding forward and lifts his legs off the mat, putting his full body weight on top of the wrestler and thus pinning their shoulders more firmly against the mat. Popularized by Genichiro Tenryu, Toshiaki Kawada and recently Gunther. Samoa Joe used this to transition into a number of submission holds.
Ganso bomb[edit]
Translated literally from Japanese as Originator Bomb (元祖 ganso), but in English more commonly referred to as the original powerbomb, this move sees the attacking wrestler make an opponent bend over and grab them in a belly to back waistlock before then lifting the opponent until they are vertical. The attacking wrestler then drives the opponent down on their neck and shoulder while either remaining in a standing position, sitting position or dropping down to their knees. The move is considered one of the most dangerous moves in professional wrestling as the person taking the move is in freefall, dropped onto their own head or neck without protection. It was invented by Lou Thesz and popularized by Toshiaki Kawada as the Kawada Driver. AJ Styles used during his tenure with New Japan Pro-Wrestling as the Hollow Point. Brock Lesnar inadvertently used the move on Hardcore Holly in 2002 which injured his neck. This was actually due to Holly sandbagging the move thus making it difficult for Lesnar to perform the move correctly.
Gutwrench powerbomb[edit]
This move involves a wrestler standing over a bent over opponent, locking their arms around the opponent's waist and lifting them up, flipping them over, and slamming them down to the mat back first. The difference compared to a regular powerbomb is that the opponent's head does not go between the wrestler's thighs, instead they remain slightly in front or to the side of the wrestler. The falling variation was used by Jack Swagger as the Swagger Bomb. ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams popularized the sitout variation, naming it the Doctor Bomb. Kenny Omega also uses the sitout variation as the Dr. Willy Bomb.
Inverted powerbomb[edit]
Also known as an Inverted front powerslam, this move sees the attacking wrestler faces a bent-over opponent and apply a gutwrench waistlock before lifting the opponent up so they are lying across the wrestler's shoulder, facing upward, with the wrestler maintaining the waistlock to hold them in position, known as an overhead gutwrench backbreaker rack. The wrestler then falls forward, standing or into a sitout position while flipping the opponent forward, driving the opponent horizontally belly-down into the ground. A double underhook version of this move also exists. Ron Simmons made the standing variation famous, calling it the Dominator, Bobby Lashley utilized a kneeling version as a finisher, while Yujiro Takahashi popularized the sitout version, calling it Tokyo Pimps.
Kneeling powerbomb[edit]
This variation of a powerbomb is similar to an ordinary powerbomb, however, instead of the wrestler remaining standing, the wrestler falls into a kneeling position while driving the opponent back-first into the mat.
Repeated powerbomb[edit]
As the name implies, the wrestler performing the move will do so multiple times. To start, they will lift the opponent into powerbomb position and perform the move. Without letting go of the opponent's waist, the wrestler raises them up again and drops them. Depending on the wrestler, they may continue to repeat the process and may pin the opponent after the last one. Although neither wrestler does this anymore, Chris Jericho and Brock Lesnar used the multiple powerbomb as a signature maneuver when they debuted in WWE; Jericho's version was a double and Lesnar's a triple.
AEW wrestler Wardlow uses a unique take on this sequence. Instead, he simply powerbombs the opponent, picks them up from the mat, and powerbombs them again for each separate time as needed to defeat them. He refers to this as the Powerbomb Symphony.
Pop-up powerbomb[edit]
As the name implies, this move begins with the opponent rushing towards the attacker who then flings the opponent vertically up into the air. The move is finished by catching the opponent and performing a powerbomb. This move was popularized by Kevin Owens and Scott Steiner.
Release powerbomb[edit]
A variation of the powerbomb where the opponent is lifted into the air and then dropped without being forced into a pin.
Kevin Nash, Big Van Vader, Bubba Ray Dudley, Chris Benoit, Sycho Sid, Lita, Sara Del Rey, John Bradshaw Layfield and Sable use this move. Raquel Rodriguez uses a one-arm version of the move itself, calling it the Chingona/Texana Bomb.
The opponent begins sitting in the corner of the ring and facing outwards, while holding on to the ring ropes. The wrestler takes hold of the opponent by the legs and pulls them upwards and backwards with a twist, falling into a sitting position as they do so. The move ends with the opponent's back on the ground and their legs over the shoulders of the wrestler, placing the opponent in a pinning predicament.
Running powerbomb[edit]
In this variation of the powerbomb, the wrestler runs before they releases the opponent. A wrestler may also sit down for a pinfall attempt.
Scoop lift powerbomb[edit]
In this variation of a powerbomb an opponent is first scooped so they are horizontal across an attacking wrestler's chest. The wrestler then pushes the opponent up and turns them, so that they are sitting on the shoulders of the wrestler, before then slamming them down in a powerbomb motion. A seated version is also possible. This maneuver was occasionally performed by ""The Alpha Male"" Monty Brown and was referred to as the Alpha Bomb. Raquel Rodriguez uses a one arm version of the powerbomb known initially as the Chingona Bomb, now dubbed the Texana Bomb.
Sit-out powerbomb[edit]
In this variation of a powerbomb, the attacking wrestler falls to a seated position as they slam the opponent down. Some wrestlers remain in seated position to pin the opponent, while others choose not to. The move can either be performed as a standard powerbomb or as a gutwrench powerbomb. The move was popularized by Jushin Liger, who used it as a finisher, known as the Liger Bomb, and was also famously used by Batista as the Batista Bomb.
Slingshot powerbomb[edit]
From a position in which the opponent is sitting across the wrestlers shoulder, the attacker bounces the opponent's back across the top rope. The attacker then spins around, using the momentum to powerbomb the opponent. This move is used by Dax Harwood and The Miz.
Spinning powerbomb[edit]
Also called a spiral bomb. The wrestler lifts the opponent up onto their shoulders and spins around several rotations before sitting down and slamming the opponent down to the mat, as in a sitout powerbomb. A release variation sees the wrestler remain standing or kneeling and just throwing the opponent away from them onto their back to the mat. A gutwrench variation is also possible, with the wrestler dropping the opponent as in a normal gutwrench powerbomb. This maneuver was used by Diamond Dallas Page, but the sitout variation was popularized by Michael Elgin, who adopted it as his finisher as the Elgin Bomb.
Spin-out powerbomb[edit]
Also known as a Blue Thunder Driver or a Blue Thunder Bomb, this is a belly-to-back powerbomb, usually beginning in the back suplex position in which the wrestler stands behind their opponent and puts their head under the arm of the opponent. They then lift the opponent up using one arm around the waist of the opponent and another under their legs. The wrestler then spins the opponent around 180°, dropping them to the mat back first as they drop to a sitting position. Invented by Jun Akiyama, it is used as a signature move by Sami Zayn, as well as Konosuke Takeshita. Apollo Crews uses a toss variation of the move. John Cena uses a kneeling variation of the move, dubbing it the Protoplex.
Straight jacket powerbomb[edit]
Also known as a pyramid driver, this move can be executed when a wrestler lifts the opponent on the shoulders between the legs, but crossing the both arms during his bent-over position before, and drops on the mat with a seated position to set up a pin. It was used by Super Crazy with the name called Crazy Bomb and by Claudio Castagnoli in a sit-out variation called the Ricola Bomb.
Sunset flip powerbomb[edit]
This move sees the wrestler bend over and place their opponent in a standing head scissors. However, the wrestler moves forward slightly so the opponent's midsection is between the wrestler's thighs instead of their head. The wrestler wraps their arms around the opponent's midsection in a waistlock, then jumps and rolls forward, under the opponent's legs, and into a seated position, forcing the opponent to fall back to the mat. The resulting position can lead to a sitout pin. This is often called a Yoshi Tonic in Japan or Code Red in America, the latter name coined by Amazing Red, and would since be used as a signature move by Mercedes Moné who refers to the move as the Code Blue, notably from 2019-2021 during her time in WWE as Sasha Banks, and as finishers by Zelina Vega and Roxanne Perez, the latter referring to the move as Pop Rox (formerly known as Pop Rok during her time in the independent circuit and in Ring Of Honor as Rok-C). The top rope version is also used sometimes, as seen in the picture above. The move is also very dangerous, because when the wrestler flips over the opponent's back, if they put too much downward force on their legs, it could result in a leg injury. Seth Rollins was injured while attempting to perform a sunset flip powerbomb by applying too much downward force on his leg, thus injuring it. An avalanche leg trap variation is used by Hirooki Goto on rare occasions as Kaiten.
Superbomb[edit]
The attacking wrestler forces the opponent to ascend to the top rope, standing usually on the top ropes with their legs spread. The wrestler then bends the opponent, placing their head between the wrestler's thighs. The wrestler then wraps their hands around the opponent's waist. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up, flipping them over, while jumping forward. The opponent falls down to the mat back first, and the wrestler usually falls to their knees or to a sitting position. This variation was popularized by Chris Candido as the Blonde Bombshell, while Bubba Ray Dudley used a sit-out version.
Another variation sees the opponent sitting on the top rope. The wrestler climbs up to the top rope and stands facing the opponent. The wrestler then bends the opponent over and takes hold of opponent around the waist. The wrestler then flips the opponent up and over so they are sitting on the shoulders of the wrestler. At the same time, the wrestler spins around 180° and leaps forward, falling to the ground in a standing or sitting position and driving the opponent's back and shoulders to the mat or can jump backwards away from the turnbuckle to drop into a seated position.
Another variant of the Superbomb was popularized by B. J. Whitmer, who used the move to toss himself and fellow wrestler Jimmy Jacobs into a crowd at a Ring of Honor show in June 2006.
Tilt-A-Whirl Powerbomb[edit]
The attacking wrestler stands facing the opponent, who is often charging at the attacker, before bending the opponent down so they are bent in front of the attacking wrestler as he/she stands over them then the wrestler reaches around the opponent's body and lifts them up, spinning the opponent in front of the wrestler's body. As the wrestler brings the opponent back down to the mat, the wrestler kneels, slamming the opponent onto the mat.
Thunder fire powerbomb[edit]
The wrestler faces a bent opponent and places them in the standing headscissors position (bent forward with their head placed between the wrestler's thighs). The wrestler then grabs hold around the opponent's upper torso or waist, and lifts them on top of one of the wrestler's shoulders on their back. The wrestler then bends forward and slams the opponent down to the mat on their back or shoulders. It is also known as an Over-the-shoulder powerbomb or a One shoulder powerbomb. Innovated by the Great Nita (Atsushi Onita). The late Mike Awesome used the standing, a running, and kneeling versions of this move as finishers. Sid Vicious also used the kneeling version of this move as a finisher early in his career and would often drop his opponents off to his side instead of forwards.
Turnbuckle powerbomb[edit]
Also known as the buckle bomb. This move sees the wrestler faces a standing opponent, bends them forwards, takes a hold around their waist and then flips the opponent up and over so the opponent is sitting on the wrestler's shoulders. The wrestler then faces a corner of the ring and throws the opponent into the corner, driving the back and neck of the opponent to the turnbuckle. The move was famously used by Kenta Kobashi and Seth Rollins. The move is considered to be dangerous if done wrong, which led to Sting temporarily retiring from wrestling (he has since returned to the ring since 2020 with AEW) and Finn Bálor injuring his shoulder in 2016. WWE banned it in 2020 after Nia Jax botched the move on Kairi Sane.[5] However, in recent years, Seth Rollins has continued to use the move semi-regularly, with Balór also using it against Rollins at Summerslam 2023, suggesting that WWE may have lifted the ban.
Snap powerbomb[edit]
This variation sees a wrestler catching an opponent mid-air or lifting them up in a standard powerbomb, before slamming him to the mat as quickly as possible.
It was used as a finisher by Chris Benoit under the name Wild Bomb.
Suplex powerbomb[edit]
The wrestler lifts the opponent upside down as in a vertical suplex and then pushes their upper body forward while sitting down, ending the move in the same position as the sitout powerbomb. A fall-forward and standing versions are also possible. The move was invented by Kenta Kobashi who called it Orange Crush. El Generico used the move with a double pumphandle cradle before delivering the Orange Crush. Jon Moxley and Roderick Strong used the standing version.

Variations[]
Release powerbomb[]
A variation of the powerbomb where the opponent is lifted into the air, and then dropped without any extra force exerted for a pinfall attempt. Sometimes the wrestler steps back while releasing the opponent, which is known as a sheer drop powerbomb due to the high elevation, or the opponent would be thrown horizontally away from the wrestler rather than merely dropped.
The step back variation was popularized in the United States by Sid Vicious, and later by Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash, who called it the Jack Knife. However, with the name it was later confused with the other Jackknife powerbomb.
Reverse Powerbomb[]
See Reverse Powerbomb
Rope aided powerbomb[]
The wrestler takes hold of an opponent, who is lying on the mat, by their legs. The opponent then grabs hold of one of the ropes with both hands as the wrestler pulls them backwards, lifting them off the mat. At this point the opponent releases their grip on the rope and is brought down to the mat.
The opponent begins sitting in the corner of the ring and facing outwards, while holding on to the ring ropes. The wrestler takes hold of the opponent by the legs and pulls them upwards and backwards, falling into a sitting position as they do so. The move ends with the opponent's back on the ground and their legs over the shoulders of the wrestler, placing the opponent in a pinning predicament.
Rydeen bomb[]
This high-lifting sitout / sitdown Spinebuster, also popularly known as a sky lift powerbomb in which a wrestler will take hold of an (often charging) opponent with each hand placed under the opponent's arm pits. At this point the attacking wrestler will lift the opponent into the air as high as possible, before dropping to a seated position so that the opponent falls backfirst between the wrestler's legs. A wrestler will often place his hands on the falling opponent's chest or hook their legs to attempt a pin. Satoshi Kojima is credited with naming the move the Rydeen Bomb, while D'Lo Brown is credited with being among the first American wrestlers to use the move, which he called the Sky High. There is also a standing side slam variation which was used by Lance Cade that is also known as a sitout / sitdown side slam spinebuster or a ura-nage driver.
Scoop lift powerbomb[]
In this variation of a powerbomb an opponent is first scooped so they are horizontal across an attacking wrestler's chest. The wrestler then pushes the opponent up and turns them, so that they are sitting on the shoulders of the wrestler, before then slamming them down in a powerbomb motion. This move was innovated by Monty Brown, who calls the move the Alpha Bomb.
Sitout powerbomb[]
Also called a sitdown powerbomb, this is any powerbomb in which the wrestler drops into a sitting position as they slam their opponent down to the mat. This maneuver can be done with many variations of the powerbomb.
The most common sitout variation is that of a standard powerbomb, in which the opponent is placed in a standing neck scissors, and then lifted up on the wrestler's shoulders. At this point, the wrestler slams the opponent down, and at the same time falls to a sitting position.
In Japan the move is often known as Liger Bomb, due to Jushin Liger who popularized it. Liger's variation actually differs from the regular sitout powerbomb in that the opponent is dropped down in a higher angle, on their shoulders instead of flat on their back, this allows him to trap the opponent's arms under his legs, since they are closer to him. Liger also uses a running variation which drops the opponent regularly flat on their back, known as a Running Liger Bomb. In the United States, both the standing and the running variations are commonly referred to as just Liger Bomb. This powerbomb is also commonly associated with The Beast and Batista, who named it the Batista Bomb.
A variation of the Running Liger Bomb was performed by Último Dragón, who named his variation the Dragon Bomb, in which he lifts the opponent, runs towards the ropes, and performed a slingshot sitout powerbomb.
Yet another variation of the sitout powerbomb is currently and popularly used by Claudio Castagnoli under the name Ricola Bomb, in which he crosses the opponent's arms before lifting them up and then dropping them.
There's also a variation where the opponent is first pumphandled, before being slammed into the mat with the powerbomb.
Slingshot powerbomb[]
From a position in which the opponent is sitting across the wrestlers shoulder, the attacker bounces the opponent's back across the top rope. The attacker then spins around, using the momentum to powerbomb the opponent.
Spinning powerbomb[]
The wrestler lifts the opponent up onto his shoulders and spins around several rotations before sitting down and slamming the opponent down to the mat, as in a sitout powerbomb. A release variation sees the wrestler remain standing or kneeling and just throwing the opponent away from them onto their back to the mat.
Spin-out powerbomb[]
Justin Gabriel performing Blue Thunder Driver on John Cena
This is a belly to back Powerbomb, usually beginning in the back suplex position where the wrestler stands behind their opponent and puts their head under the arm of the opponent. They then lift the opponent up using one arm around the waist of the opponent and another under their legs. The wrestler then spins the opponent around 180°, dropping them to the mat back first as they drop to a sitting position. Known under the name Blue Thunder Driver, a name invented by Jun Akiyama. The move is also known as Blue Thunder Bomb because it resembles a Powerbomb more than a driver. There is also a sit-out variation, a side variaton, a slingshot variation, a neckbreaker variation and a front powerslam version, the last one used by Batista in his time in Ohio Valley Wrestling under his ""Leviathan"" gimmick, where instead of hitting the powerbomb, he lifts his opponent into a running powerslam position, driving the opponent into the mat.
Another variation of this move ends in an inverted side slam position and with the wrestler going down to a kneeling position. This version has been used by John Cena throughout his career, which he calls the Proto-Bomb while wrestling as ""The Prototype"" and the Killswitch, in WWE.
Sunset flip powerbomb[]
A move in which a wrestler will roll/flip over an elevated opponent facing them in a reverse body scissors and use the momentum to pull the opponent down to the mat back first.
A variation of the move which was innovated by Super Shisa, who called it the Yoshi Tonic. This variation sees a wrestler wrap their legs around the waist of an opponent who is facing away from the attacking wrestler. The wrestler uses a 'see-saw' motion to throw himself forward pulling the opponent over the top of them and down to the mat. This version is technically known as a leg-trap sunset flip powerbomb. Notable users include Amazing Red, MsChif, Melina and Rey Mysterio. Former WWE Superstar Trevor Murdoch performs a modified version in which instead doing of the 'see-saw motion', he stands over the top of his opponent before executing the move.
Another variation was seen in the United States as used by Brian Christopher, in which the sunset flip powerbomb is executed against a wrestler standing on the ring apron, facing toward the ring. In this variation Christopher would jump over the opponent as if to execute a sunset flip and complete the move by powerbombing the opponent from the ring apron to the arena floor.
Superbomb[]
This move was popularized in America by The Pitbulls in ECW. The attacking wrestler forces the opponent to ascend to the top rope, standing usually on the top ropes with their legs spread. The wrestler then bends the opponent, placing their head between the wrestler's thighs. The wrestler then wraps their hands around the opponent's waist. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up, flipping them over, while jumping forward. The opponent falls down to the mat back first, and the wrestler usually falls to their knees or to a sitting position.
Another variation sees the opponent sitting on the top rope. The wrestler climbs up to the top rope and stands facing the opponent. They then bend the opponent over and take hold of them around the waist. The wrestler then flips the opponent up and over so they are sitting on the shoulders of the wrestler. At the same time, the wrestler spins around 180° and leaps forward, falling to the ground in a standing or sitting position and driving the opponent's back and shoulders to the mat.
Many variations of a regular standing powerbomb can be seen being done off of the top rope as well (ex. Super double underhook powerbomb, Super thunder fire powerbomb, Super crucifix powerbomb, etc.)
Tiger bomb[]
Thunder fire powerbomb[]
Also known as a One shoulder powerbomb, the wrestler faces a bent opponent and places them in the standing headscissors position (bent forward with their head placed between the wrestler's thighs). The wrestler then grabs hold around the opponent's upper torso or waist, and lifts them on top one of the wrestler's shoulders on his back. The wrestler then bends forward and slams the opponent down to the mat on his back or shoulders.
Turnbuckle powerbomb[]
The wrestler faces a standing opponent, bends them forwards, takes a hold around their waist and then flips the opponent up and over so the opponent is sitting on the wrestler's shoulders. The wrestler then faces a corner of the ring and throws the opponent into the corner, driving the back and neck of the opponent to the turnbuckle.
Vertical suplex powerbomb[]
The wrestler lifts the opponent upside down as in a vertical suplex and then pushes their upper body forward while sitting down, ending the move in the same position as the sitout powerbomb. Kenta Kobashi is the most well known user of this move and calls it the Orange Crush. However, he only uses the move in very high-profile matches.
A variation of the move in which the wrestler lifts the opponent up and flips them in one fluid motion, releasing the opponent in mid-air, allowing them to fall down to the mat onto their back, while the wrestler falls to all fours beside him, was innovated by E.Z. Money, who calls it Cha-ching Powerbomb.
Another variation used by Kenta Kobashi known as ""Spike Vertical Suplex Powerbomb"", where he didn't push the opponents as far out, so they landed on their neck and shoulders instead of their back.

Secret History on a Devastating Wrestling Move
One of the most iconic moves in wrestling is the Powerbomb. Discover the history and secrets behind one of wrestling’s most powerful statements of a maneuver, ten notable wrestlers who used it, and how a legendary wrestler’s misstep led to the creation of this legendary move!
Origins of The Powerbomb – A Move Created On Accident!
Over the years, many variations of the Powerbomb have been used in wrestling, from Diesel’s Jackknife to Seth Rollins’ Buckle Bomb. The attacking wrestler picks up their opponent so their legs are resting or straddling on their shoulders before slamming them back-first into the mat.
The Powerbomb was almost always used as a finisher, but less so in today’s era of frenetic wrestling that features plenty of false finishes.
But the original Powerbomb was invented out of a botched spot by one of wrestling’s greatest technicians: Lou Thesz.
As noted on WWE.com, Lou Thesz is the “father” of the Powerbomb, and it all happened in St. Louis, Missouri, as the Piledriver began to catch fire in the 1930s and ’40s.
Rocca reportedly lifted himself into a sit-up position to try and counter the move, but Thesz continued to throw his opponent down anyway.
Rocca landed high on his back, and in that instant, the Powerbomb was accidentally born as the two performers reportedly realized that what they had just done looked dramatic.
Word spread through the territories like wildfire that this new and innovative move had burst onto the scene.
Popularizing The Powerbomb
Word also got overseas, and the Powerbomb made its way to Japan. It was practiced in dojos around the country, where stars created their own variations and practiced its execution.
Fast forward to modern times, and Japanese greats like Jushin Thunder Liger started using it as one of their signatures.
Wrestlers like Kevin Nash, Sid Vicious, and Vader would also popularize the Powerbomb worldwide in the ’90s and beyond, where it began undergoing various changes as wrestlers added their own flavor.<
As a result, performers began throwing their opponents down harder, from greater heights, and at higher angles resulting in many injuries, including concussions, broken bones, and even paralysis, as seen in the case of Droz and D’Lo Brown.
Performers were beginning to understand that one can only take the maneuver so far before it becomes legitimately unsafe.
Notable Wrestlers Who Used The Powerbomb
Below you will find a list of ten notable wrestlers, in no particular order, who have used varying versions of The Powerbomb over the years.
1. Batista: Batista Bomb
Batista had one of the most fluid and beautiful Powerbombs in wrestling history, but nothing felt good about taking it.
Batista’s Powerbomb, dubbed the “Batista Bomb,” was unique in that it’s one of the only variations where the giver comes all the way down with the person taking it.
According to Daniel Bryan, it was one of the most unpleasant things he ever had to endure in the ring. This version is arguably one of the most well-known variations of the Powerbomb.
2. The Undertaker: The Last Ride Powerbomb
Part of the appeal of The Undertaker’s “Last Ride” Powerbomb is that The Undertaker is 6’10.”
The Last Ride is one of the most devastating maneuvers in all wrestling. Undertaker’s vertical lift before slamming his opponents down to the mat is a variation of the Powerbomb that fans will never forget.
3. Kevin Owens – Pop-Up and Apron Powerbomb
Kevin Owens has multiple variations of his Powerbomb, including both the Pop-Up and the Apron Powerbomb, although he has leaned toward using The Stunner as of late instead.
Regardless of what Owens opts to use, his Pop-Up is as impressive as the Apron Powerbomb is painful and dangerous.
With the Pop-Up, Owens throws his opponents straight into the air instead of lifting them before catching them on his shoulders and throwing them forcefully down in one fluid motion.
As for the apron landing, it’s simply a traditional Powerbomb, except the wrestler’s neck and back land straight on the corner of the ring apron.
4. Vader Bomb Powerbomb
Vader utilized his size and strength when executing his Vader Bomb Powerbomb, a favorite version of many fans.
Additionally, Vader would remain standing up to maximize the height of his opponent’s fall and create variations to better work for him as his career evolved.
5. Sid Vicious / Sycho Sid Powerbomb
Sid Vicious’ Powerbomb is both a thing of beauty and quite ugly, but he does have one trick to achieve extra impact on his way down.
Sid would drop to his knees on the way down from the Powerbomb, saving his body from an impact like Batista endured and gaining extra momentum to toss his opponent down.
6. Kevin Nash / Diesel: Jackknife Powerbomb
Another variation that can be argued as one of the most popular or iconic of the Powerbomb is “Diesel” Kevin Nash’s Jackknife.
And those taking the move had a seven-plus foot drop to the mat after Nash completed his fluid motion.
The Jackknife is one of the most recognizable yet simple variations and is often imitated to this day.
7. Jushin “Thunder” Liger: Liger Bomb
The high-impact, high-angle Liger Bomb of Jushin “Thunder” Liger” was partially responsible for bringing the Powerbomb overseas.
Additionally, Liger has one of the most satisfying yet brutal Powerbombs in the history of wrestling as he sat out with his opponents, easily and quickly pinning them for the victory and maximizing impact to the ring floor.
8. Mike Awesome: Awesome Bomb
Mike Awesome was one of the most beloved wrestlers and workers in ECW and all of wrestling, but fans, unfortunately, didn’t get to see his Awesome Bomb long enough.
The big man’s variation is considered by many to be one of the most underrated; he is an unsung great of professional wrestling.
9. “Dr. Death” Steve Williams: Doctor Bomb (Gutwrench Powerbomb)
“Dr. Death” Steve Williams is responsible for popularizing the Gutwrench variation of the Powerbomb with his Doctor Bomb, in which the opponent is hoisted up sideways by the lower stomach or abdomen before being swung into the classic Powerbomb position and thrown to the ground.
Unfortunately, as another underrated wrestling star, Dr. Death’s Powerbomb doesn’t get as much love as it should, considering we still see variations of it performed today.
10. Ahmed Johnson: Pearl River Plunge
Ahmed Johnson’s Double Underhook Powerbomb is another severely underrated entry that is one of the hardest and most impressive variations to pull off.
Again, the Pearl River Plunge used Johnson’s strength and size to his advantage, allowing him to execute on other big men such as D-Lo Brown.
The Powerbomb Today
As time went on and the pro wrestling landscape continued to change, countless variations of the Powerbomb came to light, such as the Orange Crush, the Tiger Driver, the Yoshi Tonic, Sunset Flip Powerbombs, Blue Thunder Bomb and many, many more. However, it is still recognized as an impactful and “big” maneuver.
Some of the biggest modern-day stars in wrestling, such as Kota Ibushi, Kenny Omega, and Sami Zayn, all showcase different variations of the Powerbomb in their matches.
In addition, it is often used in movies because of its recognizability, especially in anime when characters fight.
The Powerbomb will undoubtedly continue to evolve over the next hundred years.

Anyone who has watched pro wrestling or practiced amateur wrestling is familiar with the suplex. It’s one of the most explosive and flashy moves, which is why it became popular within pro wrestling.
Let’s go over the history of the suplex and how it became one of the most-known moves in the world. Read below to learn about the move’s history in wrestling and details for executing basic suplexes.
Contents
What is a Suplex?
The suplex is a classic wrestling move that has been a staple of pro wrestling and amateur wrestling for many years. This technique is classified as a “back arch” or “high amplitude throw” in wrestling, which can be a high-scoring technique.
Most of the general public is aware of suplexes due to the exposure from pro wrestling. Within pro wrestling, many variations of these “high amplitude throws” are used.
History
The suplex has been a part of amateur wrestling for centuries. No one person can be credited for inventing the move as it’s used in many forms of wrestling.
Ancient wrestling cultures such as in Greece, India, Africa, China, and Japan likely contributed to the technique’s evolution. Early forms of wrestling practiced within these areas all used variations of the suplex within them.
In modern amateur wrestling, suplexes are some of the most high-impact techniques that can be executed. If a wrestler is able to execute the technique with good form, they will be granted more points.
The History of the Suplex in Pro Wrestling
In modern pro wrestling, the suplex gained popularity as a dramatic and impactful move. They have been classically used by wrestlers to showcase their strength and athleticism.
Suplexes have always been used since the first pro wrestling shows took place in the early 20th century. Early 20th-century wrestler and strongman George Hackenschmidt commonly used suplexes in his matches.
One of the pro wrestlers, who is credited for popularizing the use of suplexes in modern pro wrestling is Karl Gotch. Karl was a legitimate elite-level wrestler, who used a realistic style of pro wrestling, which included suplex variations.
Gotch is credited with teaching Japanese wrestling legends Antonio Inoki, Billy Robinson, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, and Satoru Sayama(Tiger Mask).
In pro wrestling today, the suplex has numerous variations and is a staple of the sport.
Pro Wrestling Suplex Variations
As mentioned above, there are numerous variations of suplexes used within pro wrestling. Here are seven of the most used variations with descriptions below.
The Legalities
Over the years, amateur wrestling organizations and governing bodies have refined and standardized the rules for using suplexes. These rules for suplexes were added to ensure the safety of competitors.
For example, a suplex can be used as long as a wrestler does not drop their opponent on their head. In BJJ, similar rules are enforced, so competitors don’t drop or spike an opponent, which will cause injury.
Within MMA, the use of suplexes is totally legal and any type of suplex can be used. However, just like with the other types of combat sports, fighters cannot spike an opponent on their head.
Despite the strict regulations, suplexes remain fundamental components of wrestling. As combat sports evolve and in particular amateur wrestling, the suplex will remain an integral technique of these sports.
Belly to Belly Suplex Technique
The belly-to-belly variation of this technique is a legitimate wrestling move that is super effective. To begin this move, you can either have double underhooks or be in a 50/50 position with your opponent.
Either way, you start, you must maintain a low bodylock with your hands locked together on your opponent’s lower back. This is so your suplex is explosive when you step in and throw them.
The first step of the belly-to-belly is an outside step, where you step to the outside. Your foot goes to the outside and you place it behind your opponent’s foot as you bring your hips in.
As your hips come around, the rest of your body follows, hold your opponent tight, and throw them to their back.
There are different belly-to-belly setups and hand positioning, but they all follow the same principles. Have a good low bodylock, bring your hips/body under your opponent’s, and lift with your legs.
Belly to Back Suplex Technique
Suplexes from the back are effective and powerful techniques to take your opponent down. To get to your opponent’s back, you will need to execute a duck under.
This is performed from either an underhook or arm control, where you lift your opponent’s arm up and go to their back. Once you’re on your opponent’s back, your hands need to be clasped tightly around their waist.
Your chest must also be touching your opponent’s back so as to not give them space to turn and escape.
The key to a good belly-to back suplex is throwing your opponent on your back and not landing on your head. To ensure that you don’t injure yourself, you will have to drill arching your back doing suplexes.
A good arch requires your heels to come off the mat as you pop your hips and arch your back. If done correctly, your body will not touch the match.
Do the drills as described in the video above before you begin doing belly-to-back drills with a partner.
Tips For Doing a Suplex
No matter what type of suplex, you execute, you will have to remember important tips and details. Here are some important things to remember when executing suplexes.
Wrap Up
The suplex and its numerous variations are must-know techniques if you practice any form of grappling. Not only are they explosive grappling techniques, but they are easy to learn. Remember the tips above and definitely consider adding suplexes to your repertoire.

Technique Breakdown: ¾ Nelson to D’Arce Choke
The D’Arce choke is a popular and effective head and arm choke you can attempt from the top position in a front headlock or sprawl setup. In Alberto Crane’s ‘Front Headlock Chokes’ Instructional, Crane teaches the D’Arce choke setup with a special detail for finishing this choke utilizing a Gi grip instead of the traditional No Gi bicep grip used in submission grappling and MMA.
The setup for this choke begins from the front headlock position with you as the attacker on top. From the front headlock position, you will swim your right arm behind your opponent’s left armpit all the way through to the front of their right shoulder by the neck. You will find a better angle by positioning yourself on your opponents left side, with the line of your body perpendicular with your opponent’s left shoulder with your feet more towards your opponent’s legs as opposed to their head.
Once your right hand is on the far side of your opponent’s face, lock in a gable or S-grip and align your left forearm bone in-line with your opponent’s head and neck. You are not ‘karate chopping’ the back of their neck. Rather, you want to be able to use your left arm as a lever against your opponent’s head to force their chin into a tucked position and break down their base until they are on their left hip. This grip is known as the three-quarter Nelson.
Use your left forearm to drive your opponent’s head both down and slightly towards you to force them onto their right side and expose the full choke. At this point, if your opponent is tense and fighting, you may actually be able to finish the submission from here. Use your forearm on the back of their head to compress the chin and drop your chest weight onto their triceps, pushing their arm against their neck to finish the three-quarter nelson head and arm choke.
If your opponent relaxes to avoid the choke while you have your three-quarter nelson, you will not be able to finish the choke without further advancing position. The good news is that their relaxing to defend allows you to completely lock in the choke. To accomplish this, ease up on your grip and shoot your left hand further towards their back to set up the full D’Arce.
In this position, the standard D’Arce finish would involve you grabbing your left bicep with your right hand and compressing down to cut on your opponent’s arteries. However, if you are in a BJJ Gi, you have the option of using a sleeve grip instead of the traditional bicep grip.
To use the sleeve grip, as your shoot your left hand for the D’Arce, grab your left sleeve with a four-finger grip using your right hand. This anchor will give you immense leverage to finish the choke and will be easier than doing a traditional D’Arce. Note that you can stick your four-finger grip inside your own sleeve. This grip is not permitted on the opponent’s sleeve, largely for the safety of your fingers, however it is legal when you are gripping your own sleeve with four fingers inside.
Once you have your right-hand sleeve-gripped on your left sleeve, grab the back of your opponent’s Gi with your left hand and establish a solid anchor. With your right hand maintaining its sleeve grip, drop your weight onto your opponent’s head and triceps.
At this point, you should either allow your opponent to put you in half guard or put yourself in their half guard. While this may seem counterintuitive, by getting into their half guard, you are removing their ability to scramble and escape. Given how deep your choke is at this point, they will not be able to actually do anything with their half guard (other than tap out!).
With this grip in place, your leg in their half guard, and your weight on their triceps and hand, drive your right elbow towards the ceiling for the full leverage to finish the choke.
Step by Step D’Arce Choke in Gi:
While this choke will take some practice, it is an incredibly effective submission against failed shot attempts or anytime you find yourself on top of your opponent in a front headlock or sprawl scenario.
Access to the sleeve grip in Gi allows even greater leverage and finish percentages than the traditional D’Arce bicep grip.

The Darce Choke
The darce choke (or d’arce), also called ‘no gi brabo choke’ (not to confuse with the standard brabo choke), in Portuguese often called triângulo de braço invertido or even triângulo de mão, is a choke used in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, MMA and other grappling sports which is a variation of the katagatame (arm triangle) and the anaconda chokes. The difference between the darce and the anaconda choke lies on the positioning of the ‘lock’, which ultimately defines the way the pressure should be exerted. The darce choke is applied by wrapping both arms around the opponent’s neck, leaving one arm inside and another one outside this hold. The name ‘darce’ derives from an American grappler by the name of Joe D’arce, famed for his use of the choke, though the actual choke may have originated in Germany, created by a luta livre esportiva competitor called Björn Dag Lagerström.
The History of the Darce Choke
As per usual, we would like to explain that grappling is an ancient art form, and as such many positions and techniques MAY have existed prior to these, more recent, (re) discoveries of positions. That said, the brabo choke became famous in Jiu Jitsu by the hands (or arms rather) of a black belt named Milton Vieira.
Darce grip
Milton learnt most of his grappling skills through Jefferson “Jop” Pereira, a luta livre coach who (according to Milton) taught a very Jitsu oriented grappling style. Vieira eventually moved on to MMA joining the famous Brazilian Top Team (BTT), one of the top Mixed Martial Arts teams in the early early/mid 2000’s, to further develop his skills. BTT was led by Zé Mario Sperry, Murilo Bustamante, Ricardo Libório and ‘Bebeo’ Duarte, all well known Jiu Jitsu fighters, and Milton Vieira’s slick submission orientated game fitted perfectly in the philosophy of the group. Milton brought several grappling positions to the team, specially his signature ‘anaconda’ and the now called darce chokes which were picked up with great interest by some of the team’s top fighters, including Rodrigo ‘Minotauro’ Nogueira. Minotauro was the superstar of the team, who at the time was ranked as the number 2 heavyweight in the world. Rodrigo learnt Vieira’s chokes and was very successful at the highest level of MMA competition utilizing these same techniques which raised the awareness of Jiu Jitsu’s mainstream competitors to these moves.
With the position gaining international recognition Daniel D’Dane, the president of Rio de Janeiro’s Luta Livre Esportiva federation, was quick to assert Luta Livre as the creator of the position, in an open letter directed at the media he wrote:
the ‘triângulo de braço invertido’ the move with which the athlete Milton Vieira submitted Cro-Cop (E.N.:Bruno Lobato) at Bitteti Combat was developed in the late 1990’s in Germany by a student of mine of Norwegian origin, while I was coaching there.
Anaconda grip
The norwegian student that Mr D’Dane mentions was Björn Dag Lagerström who created the position, by accident, after Daniel taught him the anaconda choke, Björn would use this position in 1996 for the first time in competition at a german submission grappling tournament named “TAP” (Torneio Pega-Onça) where he submitted 3 opponents with this new choke.
Daniel D’Dane would return to Brazil in 2001, where he taught the position to his Brazilian team mates at the RFT (Renovação Fight Team) where the famous Alexandre Pequeno trained. Pequeno would also be important in the development and raise awareness to the choke among his luta livre peers who later passed the position to Milton.
Joe D’arce was a well known competitor in grappling tournaments of the mid 2000’s. A representative of Renzo Gracie and his New York jiu jitsu academy, D’arce learnt the technique from RGA’s coach, John Danaher.
Having won several fights making better use of the choke, D’arce caught the eye of another American grappler named Marc Laimon. Laimon labelled the technique “the darce choke”, and being a very well respected grappling coach in USA’s west coast, the name started being mentioned in the area to define the position. With the growing popularity of Jiu Jitsu in the west coast, darce became the more common name for this technique.

The D’arce Choke Explained
What is the D’arce Choke?
Knowing how to submit is one of the facets of being a great grappler. There are many types of grappling submissions that a grappler can add to their toolbox of submissions but one submission that is a must know is the D’arce Choke.
The D’arce choke, also known as the no-gi Brabo choke, screw choke and variation of head and arm choke is often confused with the Anaconda choke. The difference between the D’arce Choke and the Anaconda choke is that when attempting the D’arce choke, you force your choking arm under the opponents near arm then under the opponent’s neck then closing with your far arm, where as the Anaconda starts the same position but first at the neck and then the the opponent’s arm afterwards.
Often called the Brabo choke, the D’arce choke is a bit different as the Brabo choke was originally a Gi choke that used the opponent’s gi for a grip to attain the choke.
Where did the name D’arce Choke come from?
Although it is common belief that the D’arce choke was invented by a Renzo Gracie blackbelt named John D’arce, it was actually invented by a Norwegian Luta Livre practitioner named Bjorn Dag Lagerstrom who found the choke variation while trying to do an Anaconda choke but accidentally had his arm position reversed thus stumbling upon the D’arce choke. He would use this in competition to tap his opponent’s out and thus the choke became known in the Luta Livre community.
The name of the choke eventually switched to the D’arce Choke when John D’arce was rolling with MMA fighter Jason Miller and got the choke on Miller, Miller being unaware of the technique called it the D’arce choke and the name has stuck ever since.
The Effectiveness of the D’arce Choke
A very effective and grappling competition tested technique, the D’arce choke has been used successfully in Nogi BJJ, submission grappling, Luta Livre, Catch Wrestling and MMA competition.
The choke is very fast and very aggressive in nature as unlike the Anaconda, there is no real need for a gator roll to secure position for the choke. The D’arce, like the Anaconda choke, is generally placed when the opponent is in Turtle position although the D’arce choke can be applied from a multitude of positions and even when escaping when in the side control position from the bottom. The Darce choke is a blood choke and when applied properly is extremely tight and effective.
In Conclusion
The D’arce choke is a must know choke for Nogi BJJ, Submission Grappling and MMA, it is fast, will catch your opponent surprisingly when done properly and works at all levels of grappling and MMA competition. The D’arce choke is a great example of BJJ for MMA and will continue to be used by top grapplers and fighters forever.
Here is a D’arce choke video we made for our Grapplezilla YouTube channel that is great for beginners and we highly recommend to watch.

Aug 29, 2023BJJEE1 AdminArticles
There are countless versions of the D’arce choke which is also called the Katagatame in Japanese because it is a form of arm triangle although the chocking mechanics are slightly different.
The D’Arce choke, or Brabo choke, is similar to the Anaconda choke. The difference is that the choking arm is threaded under the near arm, in front of the opponent’s neck, and on top of the far arm. The choke gets its name from Joe D’Arce, a third-degree Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt under Renzo Gracie.
Though not the inventor of the choke, D’Arce performed this choke often and with great success in many Jiu-Jitsu and submission grappling tournaments. During a sparring session with Jason Miller, the choke surprised Miller, who gave it the name and pronunciation “Darce” rather than the proper “D-Arsee,” when D’Arce did not have a title for the technique.
To able to start catching your opponents in Darce chokes from all positions, you need to work your muscle memory to the point were setting up a Darce becomes automatic.
Did you know that you could do a D’Arce Choke from standing?
Yup, that’s right! Here is how to do it, as explained by Travis Moore:

So you want to learn the D’arce Choke. That’s great because it’s one of BJJ’s most influential submissions. You want to learn and know to use this submission if you want to call yourself a solid grappler.
Learning the D’arce Choke opens up many options for you in your BJJ game. We’ll review 7 variations of the D’arce from different positions just in this article! Hopefully, you understand that 7 more options to go for, each from a different position, is extremely beneficial.
So what will this article cover? I’m glad you asked.
The 1st part of this article will explain what it is and what’s common in all 7 variations. For instance, you’ll understand that it’s a choke that you apply using a biceps grip, which you might have never seen.
The 2nd, and longer, part of the article will review 7 different variations. For example, the 1st will be from Side Control while the rest will cover other positions, such as Turtle and Half Guard. Lastly, the 3rd part will be about tips to use this submission better.
Reading this article in order will be of great use to you in the future. You’ll learn it the right way, which will make you better than most grapplers.
Let’s dive in!
What is a D’arce Choke
This part of the article will give the basic knowledge to start learning the different variations. You’ll be surprised as to how much you can learn by investing a few minutes in reading this article. I’ve been able to learn enough to write a book about the D’arce Choke in a few hours of researching and writing (and plenty of experience, of course!)
Back to our topic, what is a D’arce Choke?
The D’arce Choke is a submission taught in BJJ and MMA that utilizes a bicep grip to inflict a lot of pressure on the opponent’s neck. Once you wrap one of your arms around your opponent’s neck, you bring your other arm and lock them (bicep grip.) Then, you finish by applying neck pressure.
It’s an excruciating choke. You’ll be able to cause so much pressure and physical pain by executing this choke. Thus, you must pay attention to your opponent when you apply the pressure at the end; once he taps, release all pressure immediately.
To conclude, the D’arce is a submission that grappling-based martial arts teach. It utilizes a bicep grip around the opponent’s neck to apply tons of pressure, forcing your opponent to tap. You can execute it from a variety of positions, such as Side Control, Full Mount, and Half Guard.
D’arce Choke Variations
Now that you’re familiar with the basics of the D’arce Choke, let’s review 7 of its variation that you want to start learning. Learning each of these will add another tool to your toolbox.
And the more tools you have, the more threatening you’ll be as a grappler. Thus, it’ll be worth it to start learning these variations one by one, which is why I encourage you to bookmark this article. Bookmarking this guide will allow you to keep this source of knowledge available, giving you an advantage in your learning process.
So without further ado, let’s dive into the 1st variation, also the most popular one, from Side Control!
#1 – D’arce Choke From Side Control
Alright. So the 1st variation we’ll cover is the D’arce Choke from Side Control. Why did I decide to list it as the first one? You might ask. In short, because it’s the most popular.
I’m a big believer in not learning what’s popular, but what’s actually working. Nevertheless, this is what’s actually working! Although your opponent might expect you to go for the D’arce when in top Side Control, you’ll still be successful using it.
There are countless options to finish the fight when you’re in top Side Control. You can go for the Loop Choke, Baseball Choke, Bread Cutter Choke, Lapel Choke, and Triangle Choke. By the way, if you want to finish more fights when in Side Control, follow this link.
This is how you perform the standard D’arce Choke. You’ll notice how you’re capable of using it immediately after getting comfortable with it and getting your first wins—using it—under your belt.
Let’s move on to the 2nd variation, which will be from the Full Mount!
#2 – Mounted D’arce Choke
The 2nd variation we’ll cover is D’arce Choke from the Full Mount position. Typically, the D’arce Choke will be from Side Control, which is also why I’ve decided to start the 1st variation with it.
Anyways, the Mounted variant is less popular. Now is that a disadvantage? I think not. Do you want to know why? Because it’s less popular, you’re also more likely to make it work, as your opponents won’t expect you to go for it when in Mount.
They might expect you to go for the Americana, for example; but not to go for the D’arce Choke. That’s why I encourage you to learn this submission. While it might be less effective, it compensates for that by being more surprising!
Here’s how to do the Mounted D’arce:
Learn more about the Mount position and how to use it properly by following this link.
#3 – D’arce From Half Guard
The Half Guard is a position you want to learn to use because it allows you endless options, both from top and bottom. As a result, you must familiarize yourself with it to call yourself a competent grappler.
Nonetheless, this variation is going to be from top Half Guard. Although it might seem that the opponent has the advantage, as he’s in bottom, you’re actually the one who’s about to finish the fight.
This is how you can finish from top Half Guard using the D’arce Choke:
Fairly simple, isn’t it?
#4 – D’arce Choke on Turtle
The 4th variation we’ll review is from the Turtle position. Or, more precisely, on someone that’s in the Turtle position.
First of all, if you’re unfamiliar with this wonderful position, it’s time you familiarize yourself with it. So follow this link to learn more about the Turtle position and how to finish/escape from it.
Nonetheless, here’s how to perform the D’arce Choke From the Turtle position:
You’ll see how fast the coach that presents this submission executes this variation in the video below. It really shouldn’t take more than a few seconds to execute flawlessly.
What’s fantastic about this variation is that if you’re unsuccessful with it (a possibility), you’re in the Mount position. Do you understand how awesome that is? Not only did you manage to force the opponent out of his Turtle, but you also finished in one of BJJ’s most dominant positions.
From the Mount, you can finish with endless options, such as with the Americana, Armbar, Bow and Arrow Choke, and Monoplata.
Learn to finish from the Full Mount position perfectly—by following this link.
#5 – D’arce Choke From Sprawl
The Sprawl position is one that’s more used in grappling, in general, than in BJJ. That’s why you can skip this section if you’ve never heard of it.
However, you never know when you’ll stumble upon this position and need to finish the fight from it. If you’re someone who wants to enrich his knowledge to a point where he’s skyrocketing his grappling abilities, not just in BJJ, definitely read this section!
As you can see, most D’arce Chokes variations end with the same principle: walk toward his feet. This is a mechanism that allows you to apply tons of pressure on the opponent’s neck and force him to tap out.
And you also want to squeeze your hands while walking toward his feet. You’ll see how fast your opponent will tap when you perform both actions simultaneously.
The takeaway from this section is that you should learn as much as possible about the technique you’re learning, even if there’s a 0% chance you’ll use it.
#6 – D’arce Choke From Bottom Side Control
I’m a huge fan of this D’arce variation for one primary reason: when the opponent has Side Control over you, he has the upper hand. You have anything but the advantage in the fight. Therefore, this submission offers you a way out, which is something you want to familiarize yourself with.
That’s why I encourage you to learn this variation as soon as you’re finished reading this article. I also recommend bookmarking this article, so you have your knowledge source to come back to when you want to advance to the next variation or refresh your memory.
So here’s how you perform this D’arce Choke from bottom Side Control.
I know what you’re thinking. This seems too good to be true. Well, it kind of is, but in a surprisingly positive way. What I mean by that is this D’arce Choke variation works.
Thus, I encourage everyone to learn and practice it. Just see how fast it’s performed in the video above. The coach is able to move from bottom Side Control to a dominant position to finish the fight in under a few seconds.
Amazing.
If you want to learn to finish from Side Control, follow this link!
#7 – D’arce Choke From Top Butterfly Guard
The last variation we’ll cover is the D’arce Choke from top Butterfly Guard. If you’re unfamiliar with the Butterfly Guard, you want to learn to use it properly and get comfortable with it before learning this variation.
Anyways, here’s how to perform the D’arce Choke from top Butterfly Guard, a relatively inferior position:
You’ll eventually end up in the North-South position, which is already a dominant position in itself. I’m a fan of this variation because it allows you to go from an inferior position (top Butterfly Guard) to a highly dominant position.
Not only do you have the D’arce Choke grip in place, but you also are in a dominant position assuming the opponent escapes your lock.
But of course, such a feat is unlikely. If you want to read about Guards, including Open and Closed Guards, and how to use them properly—follow this link.
D’arce Choke Tips
This last part of the article will review 3 tips that will definitely skyrocket your D’arce Choke skills. You’ll be able to finish fights using it and do so more often.
So this part is a critical one for you to understand.
Tip #1 – Tighten your neck wrap
The 1st tip is regarding your neck wrap. Once you wrap your first arm around the opponent’s neck, you want it to be as tight as possible.
Many grapplers forget that they want their chokes to be as tight and excruciating as possible. As a result, the pressure they generate isn’t enough to get the tap.
Tighten the arm that wraps the neck.
Tip #2 – Walk toward the feet
Once you got your D’arce Lock, your next goal is to apply as much pressure as possible. You’re doing that by applying force in two different ways. The first way is obvious, which is to squeeze your hands as hard as possible.
But many grapplers forgo the 2nd way, which is to walk toward the opponent’s feet.
Once you got the D’arce Choke locked, you want to walk toward the opponent’s feet. This will allow you to apply more neck pressure, guaranteeing the tap.
Tip #3 – Learn all the variations (one by one)
The 3rd tip is less practical, but it’s one you want to understand. You want to familiarize yourself with all the variations in this instructional post. Do so—and you’ll become a much more threatening grappler.
BJJ is like Chess. The more moves you know to use properly, the better of a player you will be. The same applies to Jiu-Jitsu. If you want to become a much more competent grappler, you want to strive to learn as much as possible without forgetting to get on the mat and get some real experience.
Learning all the variations is something you want to do.
Final Words
Ending this article, there’s one takeaway I encourage you to take (at least that’s my takeaway.) Constant learning is the key to skyrocketing your grappling skills.
You’ll become a more threatening grappler by learning more variations of the same techniques. And that’s why I included 7 variations in this instructional post. I encourage you to learn all of them, but not simultaneously.
Choose one and practice until you’re comfortable executing it with your eyes shut. The more comfortable you are with a submission, the more success you’ll find with it, as you can use it without thinking about it.

So you want to learn the Omoplata. Well, you came to the right place. My aim with this article is to (1) teach you what the Omoplata is, (2) walk you through its basics, and (3) finish off with many of its variations you want to familiarize yourself with.
The Omoplata is one of BJJ’s most effective submissions you want to learn when you’re a white belt. Many grapplers focus on the most basic techniques, such as the Kimura, Guillotine, and Triangle. Eventually, they miss out on many effective submissions and techniques that will serve them for their entire BJJ career.
The Omoplata is one of these techniques. It works against novice and advanced grapplers, as it’s quite hard to defend. So it’s possible for you to learn it right now and start using it in spars and fights. You’ll see just how effective it can be.
I’ve ordered the article the way it is thoughtfully. I encourage you to follow each section without skipping any section. The way this article is ordered is the most suitable way for many BJJ trainees to learn quickly. You’ll develop better muscle memory if you go through the sections the way they are.
Alright. Enough chit-chat. It’s time we dive into the real stuff!
What Is an Omoplata?
Submissions are a critical part of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. What they do is allow you to hyperextend a specific body part, such as the shoulder, foot, and even knee, to force the opponent to give up. We also got chokes, but they’re for another article.
Anyways, this article is about the Omoplata, which is a submission that utilizes hyperextending the opponent’s shoulder. If you apply too much pressure, you might end up breaking the opponent’s shoulder, which is an outcome you must avoid at all costs.
So what is it exactly?
The Omoplata is a shoulder manipulation submission that’s taught in grappling-based martial arts, especially in BJJ and MMA. You first start in a position such as Closed Guard, isolate the opponent’s arm and turn until you’re parallel with the opponent. Lastly, you hyperextend the arm and shoulder.
It’s really not as complicated as many BJJ coaches say it is. What you’ll need is to follow through with this article and start learning this submission as soon as you’re done with this instructional post.
So now, let’s dive into its basics. They are the fundamentals you must know before you start your learning process.
Omoplata Basics
Alright. You’ve made it to the 2nd part of this article. By now, you understand that the Omoplata is a shoulder manipulation submission and will require you to isolate the opponent’s arm.
For the sake of order, I’ll review the basics of the Omoplata from the Closed Guard position. If you’re unfamiliar with the Closed Guard, follow the link to read about it. Understanding this position is critical before you advance into this submission.
But you likely are familiar with it. So let’s dive into the 1st tip.
#1 – Don’t break the opponent’s posture in Closed Guard
The 1st basic is regarding the fact that you want to isolate the opponent’s arm. Think about it, which position is most suitable for you to achieve that? Well, the best position to achieve that is when the opponent’s arm is straight.
How will the opponent’s arm look if you break his posture? That’s right, it’ll be bent. That’s why you want to avoid breaking the opponent’s posture.
If you have a basic understanding of the Closed Guard position, you know that a fundamental of it is to break the opponent’s posture. It allows you to go for many submissions, such as the Ninja Choke, Ezekiel Choke, Helio Gracie Choke, and Straight Foot Lock.
Learn about the best submissions from the Closed and Open Guard positions by following this link!
So avoid the popular tip of breaking the opponent’s posture when you desire to execute the Omoplata.
#2 – The goal is to isolate the arm using your legs
The 2nd fundamental is to understand your goal. To start thinking about getting into this submission and finishing the fight, you want to first isolate the opponent’s arm.
Because we’re reviewing the Omoplata from the Closed Guard position, it’s easier to understand. But what if you were in Open Guard? In this case, it would be much harder to isolate the opponent’s arm, especially with your legs.
Why is that the case, one might ask? In short, it’s because your opponent has many defensive options when you don’t have your legs wrapped around his hips; Hence, when you’re in Closed Guard.
Your goal is to isolate the opponent’s arm using your legs. That’s the end goal and you want to keep that in mind.
#3 – Grab the opponent’s triceps and wrist
The next part of the Omoplata is to pull the opponent’s arm while twisting and isolating it. As you might know, BJJ is all about control. And what better way is there to gain control than to use grips?
Which grips should you use? The best grips you want to use will be on the opponent’s triceps and wrist. You’ll get more control by gripping these body parts.
Some people like going for the 2-handed wrist grip, which I think is less practical. You’d be able to pull the opponent much more aggressively and assertively when you have one hand on his triceps. You’ll also be able to extend it easily.
#4 – Bend his arm using your hips and hands
We’ll review the exact steps later. But for now, know that you’ll bend the isolated arm once you’re about to turn. A bent arm is much easier to control and twist. As a result, you want to bend his arm.
Now how do you do that? You can do that by using both your hips (lower body) and hands (upper body.) It seems that many novice grapplers only use one or the other while using both can benefit you more.
Thus make sure to use both your lower and upper body to bend the opponent’s arm.
#5 – To finish, bend your legs and sit up
For the last fundamental we’ll review—we’ll talk about the finishing mechanism. It might be difficult for some of you to finish once you are already in the finishing position. The Omoplata deserves its place in Jiu-Jitsu’s Hall of Fame, as it gives you tons of control, more than most submissions.
The most common way the opponent can use to escape your Omoplata is by rolling forward. And once you got his hand isolated, he’s pretty much doomed. If he rolls forward, he’ll end up submitting himself, so there’s no need to worry about that.
Anyways, you want to finish the Omoplata by bending your legs sideways and sitting. You’ll use your hips to generate more force and hyperextend the opponent’s shoulder even further.
This is the optimal way to finish the Omoplata.
Omoplata Variations
This part of the article is the last one. What it’ll discuss is variations of the Omoplata, which you want to familiarize yourself with before you decide which one you’ll learn first.
You might even choose a variation I didn’t cover in this article, which is totally fine. It might be even more optimal if you think another one, which I haven’t covered, is more suitable for your grappling style.
This might be the most important part of the article, as it’ll allow you to see how the Omoplata plays out from different positions.
Alright. Without further ado, let’s dive in!
Omoplata From Closed Guard
The first variation we’ll review is the Omoplata from the Closed Guard position. This is the one I encourage you to learn first. That’s for two reasons: first, it’s the simplest – and second, it’ll give you the best foundation to learn the other ones faster.
Here’s how to perform the Omoplata from Closed Guard:
Fairly long, isn’t it? Well, it’s still the simplest one we’ll cover, as it’s easy to understand. I’ve tried to go as deeply as possible into this variation, so you’ll understand just how much detailed you can go. And I can go into far greater detail.
Here’s a visual aid you might find helpful:
Omoplata From Side Control
The 2nd variation will be from Side Control. Hopefully, you’ve heard about this position. If you haven’t and want to learn the basics of Side Control, follow this link. Likewise, if you want to learn how to finish from Side Control (The right way) follow the 2nd link.
Anyhoo, this variation will get you to start winning more often from Side Control. We all know it’s a dominant position that allows you to go for countless submissions and other options. However, not many grapplers will expect you to go for the Omoplata from Side Control, as it’s less common.
While it’s less common, it’s definitely not less effective.
Here’s how to perform the Side Control Omoplata:
This is it for this variation. It’s actually more complicated than the previous variant, even though it contains fewer steps.
Mounted Omoplata
The last variation we’ll review is the Mounted Omoplata. Or, in simpler terms, Omoplata from the Full Mount position.
As you might know, the Full Mount is one of BJJ’s most dominant positions. You can execute countless of moves from this position, such as attaining the Back Mount position or finishing the fight using any of the endless sets of submissions.

Here’s how to perform the Mounted Omoplata properly:
This is the least common variation. The most popular variant is from the Closed Guard. However, the fact that it’s less popular doesn’t mean that it’s less effective. In fact, less grapplers will expect you to perform it from the Mount, which might make it more attractive for you to learn.

Grappling
The Omoplata is a shoulder lock performed by isolating the shoulder and arm using our legs. In Portuguese, ‘Omoplata’ translates as ‘Shoulder Blade,’ specifically referring to the Scapula or flat wide bone in the shoulder. The Omoplata, by extending the shoulder beyond its range of motion, causes subluxation in the joint and can lead to both shoulder dislocations and arm breaks.
The submission has its roots in Judo or Catch Wrestling and has proven effective in both gi and no gi grappling arts. Despite not seeing wide use in MMA (with only a couple ever being recorded in the UFC), the move is still a classic that presents many opportunities and pathways.
We’ll look at the Omoplata from the closed guard and a less common escape strategy I originally saw Renzo Gracie using in old rolling tapes.
Table of Contents
How To Perform The Omoplata (Step By Step)
Step 1: Control The Wrists
When in closed guard, make sure you control your opponent’s wrists. Our first priority is winning the hand fight and then attacking our opponent’s balance and posture.
Step 2: Ground Their Hands
Notice how I’ve pulled my knees forward to break his posture and bring his hands to the mat. This will allow us to isolate a shoulder, which is now closer to us than when our opponent is sitting upright.
Step 3: Make An Angle
I use a hand as a frame on my opponent’s neck and shift my hips to create an angle. Notice that at this stage, we must open our guard and bring our leg high over their shoulder.
Step 4: Isolate The Shoulder And Arm
I use my high leg to break their posture and my arm to wrap theirs. I need to fully isolate their trapped arm and shoulder here to begin to rotate out and apply the shoulder lock.
Step 5: Shoot The High Leg
From this angle, you can see how I have taken my high leg up and over his shoulder.
Step 6: Build Height
I immediately sit up, reach over their hip, and break their posture down completely. I also reach up and over their back to capture their far hip.
Step 7: Breaking Posture
Sometimes, if they are still on their knees, I will shuffle my hips away from theirs to break them down to a prone position. From here, it’s very difficult for them to escape or defend the lock effectively.

Step 8: ‘S’ Sit
Now that I have his arm and shoulder isolated by my primary leg, I want to start applying pressure for the submission. To do this, I want to ‘S’ Sit, bringing the heel of my primary leg towards my body so I can start projecting my hips up and over that leg for the finish.
Step 9: Finish
After I ‘S’ Sit, I can now project my hips off the mat and torque his arm, applying pressure to the shoulder. I like to try and bring my forehead over the back of his head and continue raising my hips until they tap.
How To Escape The Omoplata
Step 1: Danger
So we allowed our opponent to get to start setting up an omoplata. For time’s sake, I will show the latest possible stage escape. Most defense will be ineffective after an opponent breaks you down beyond this stage.
Anything earlier than this is also undoubtedly preferable, as we never want an opponent to develop control over us. As always, the best defense is never letting them get there in the first place. Easier said than done, I know.
Step 2: Far Side Shoulder roll
Because his legs trap my right shoulder, I will execute a shoulder roll under with my left shoulder to the mat. My primary aim here is to get my head under his knee. This will allow me to ‘unwind’ the loop he has over my shoulder.
Step 3: Roll Through
I roll through now, allowing my hips to come high and my head to spin through from under his legs to the outside of his hip. You know the roll is finished when you have visual confirmation of the trapped arm’s hand in front of your face.
Step 4: Sit Up
Use the momentum of your roll to start sitting up. At this stage, your trapped arm elbow will be free to slip out below his leg. Pull it free as soon as you can.
We’re not done yet! Don’t just accept that you’ve escaped the submission. Capitalize on your opponent’s anchored hips and start getting up.
Step 5: Consolidate
Now that you’re out, get up!
One of the trade-offs your opponent is making by attempting the omoplata is that they need to try and anchor their hips to the mat.
By using our escape, we have momentum that we can use to ride ours up and above theirs, essentially creating a wrestle-up or hip heist situation. Now I have height on my side, and I can begin to move back towards building a pass or offense.
What Does The Omoplata Break?
The Omoplata creates breaking force across the forearm, elbow, upper arm, and shoulder. Any of these areas can experience a break or dislocation from the pressure of an Omoplata.
In most cases, victims will experience the tearing of ligaments or tendons in the elbow or shoulder, but bone breaks are not impossible due to the direction or amount of pressure.
Is An Omoplata A Choke?
No, the Omoplata is a joint lock, specifically a shoulder/ arm lock. There are uncommon variations where practitioners have applied chokes in combination with the Omoplata. On its own, it will not cause strangulation.
Summary
In conclusion, the Omoplata can be considered one of the ‘classic’ moves from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. With the innovation of the closed guard by the Gracies and early Brazilian pioneers, the Omoplata became a staple move in the gi.
Despite not seeing the same level of use in no gi, the move is no less effective. Competitors like Clark Gracie, Bernardo Faria, and Andre Galvao leaned heavily on the technique throughout their competition careers.
Personally, I’ve been a big fan of the Omoplata since my early days of training, finding that I can recruit my strong, stocky legs to trap the arm & shoulder to great effect.
Consider adding this move to your submission arsenal and enjoy the transitions and opportunities that branch off!

How to use the Omoplata – from start to finish
The Omoplata is a shoulder lock that is designed to rotate the shoulder blade into breaking point. In brief, it acts in the same way as a Kimura, albeit the movement of the shoulder is generated by the attacker’s legs, instead of their arms. Like the Kimura, this means that the Omoplata can be attacked from almost anywhere and it can be highly effective when used correctly.
Perhaps the biggest issue with Omoplata’s is when they’re done by inexperienced people. Generally to finish an Omoplata, you need a lot of control and there are quite a few steps to get to the finishing position. Because of this, a lot of people think the Omoplata is too complex. In reality, it’s not – it just needs practice and once you’ve mastered it, it is a fantastic submission.
Going further, it’s not just a submission either. The Omoplata also acts as a sweeping tool and can be used to get to the opponent’s back. Here we shall go into detail about all the key elements that make an Omoplata work – and what to avoid.
Table of Contents
Entries into the Omoplata
Like most moves in BJJ, there are various ways to get an Omoplata so regardless of your game, there should be something available for you. One good piece of Omoplata’s is that they’re always available when going for a regular Triangle. In other words, they work by exposing one arm of the opponent. When shooting a Triangle, this is done by isolating one arm then shooting over it. With an Omoplata, it’s a similar concept, but your leg doesn’t fling over the should. Instead, it shoots around the shoulder.
Ideally, this should put enough tension to put the opponent’s shoulder on the mat. Once this is done you can connect your legs together and the weight should keep your legs latched onto the free arm of the opponent. At this point, you have entered an Omoplata. Usually, people lock their legs in a Triangle to make the control tighter.
As you may have noticed, there are other available entries from similar submissions. If the angle is right then you can also get there from Armbars. This is a good option when the opponent does a hitchhiker escape from an Armbar for instance. Here, you can do a forwards roll and land in an Omoplata. Sometimes, you can also attempt this entry whilst doing an Omoplata from guard. However, often the angle isn’t as freely available.
Away from submissions, there are generally two entries to be applied when looking at the Omoplata. The first is from the bottom guard, and the second is from the top.
Omoplata entries from guard
One of the best qualities of the Omoplata is its ability to enter it from almost anywhere. For instance, rangy players can use entries from Spider Guard by extending their opponents one arm with their own leg. From there, you can shoot up your leg over the shoulder blade and wrap up an Omoplata.
In more close-contact guards, the Omoplata is also available. For instance, if you get an overhook on the opponent whilst in bottom Half Guard, then you can shoot your leg over their arm and get a nearside Omoplata.
Perhaps the most common entry that you will see though is from the Closed Guard. This is when the opponent stands up. You can grab their sleeve or wrist and invert slightly, then shooting your legs over their controlled arm. Often this will lead to a sweep or submission.
In short, it’s best to think about the Omoplata as a fluid concept rather than anything else. Whilst the three above examples are relatively common, there’s also a number of other guards to attack the Omoplata from. For example, shooting your leg out of a Lasso wrap can also get you a quick entry, alongside many other situations.
In no gi, the Rubber Guard also offers Omoplata set ups, as long as you’re flexible enough to control by using a High Guard. Alternatively, the Williams Guard is also great for less flexible practitioners.
Omoplata entries from top positions
When playing on top, Omoplata entries are also available. As previously mentioned, one of these is from a failed Armbar attack. Other positions include the top Turtle. Here, if you can get your legs wrapped around an arm then you can forwards roll into a reverse Omoplata, which is kind of similar to a Crucifix entry.
There are other positions to enter the Omoplata too from the top. Remember, as long as a shoulder is exposed, then an Omoplata is always close by. One example could be from the top mount position. If an opponent hugs your body in an MMA style defense, then you can again wrap your leg around the shoulder and do one from the top. Similarly, if an opponent exposes their shoulder from side control then the same principle applies.
Generally though, most Omoplata’s are attacked from the bottom position. This is because the Omoplata is often used to sweep and can be difficult for some people to finish. As a result, some deem Omoplata attacks from the top as too risky and flamboyant. For instance, the above cases can often be finished by a Kimura or something more simplistic and less risky. Nonetheless, if you’re confident of your control and finishing, then there’s no reason to avoid Omoplatas from the top.
Controlling the opponent
This is where the battle of the Omoplata is won and lost. Often, people lack control with the Omoplata and this allows the opponent to escape. Imagine doing a Rear naked choke. Whilst this is a technical submission, it’s somewhat natural and most humans know how to strangle. Even if the RNC is sloppy, sometimes it can get a tap, even if it’s a crank.
The Omoplata is kind of the opposite to this and requires a lot of correct movements from start to finish. This is the main reason why it’s rarely attempted by those who are scared of losing the position. The last thing you want to do is dominate an opponent and have them end up in a top position from a failed submission attempt. Here are the main parts of control whilst doing the Omoplata.
How to finish the Omoplata
If the above has been done then you should now be controlling the opponent. When this is in place, you can begin to apply the finishing touches. In short, this process is all about breaking posture. The original posture needs to be taken from the shoulder, and then you need to break them down further to stop any late escapes.
As mentioned, remember to keep your legs tight and cup their elbow if necessary. Sometimes, it can slip out and you can lose everything. To finish the Omoplata, you want to move your hips forward as if trying to sit up. Whilst doing this, you want to lean over the body of your opponent. A good way to remember this is as if you’re trying to whisper if their far ear. Obviously, some people are tough and flexible, so you may need to go further forwards in this case.
A key part of finishing the Omoplata is remembering to apply it safely. Sometimes, people will just sit up with no regard for the opponent’s safety. Remember, the Omoplata is like a Kimura. With this in mind, it would be like quickly ripping on a Kimura as quickly as you can.
Whilst you should still try to finish the submission and don’t be too kind, remember this is a shoulder lock that can cause great damage to the opponent’s shoulder. If you have full control then you should be able to finish the submission at your own pace and there should be no need to go too quickly.
Differences between the Omoplata in gi vs no gi
As a general rule, the Omoplata is easier to finish in the gi, in comparison to no gi. There are a couple of reasons for this. The first reason is that entries are easier. Usually, it is easier to control an arm with a sleeve grip, compared to a wrist grip. This means you can pull the opponent in by their sleeve, as opposed to their wrist. Similarly, if pulling at the shoulder or elbow, gi grips are also much easier than grips without material.
The next reason is for escapes. As previously referenced, sometimes the elbow can slip free. As no gi sometimes gets very slippy, this is something to keep in mind. In the gi however, the extra material adds more friction. This goes for most submissions and isn’t exclusive to the Omoplata. As a generalization most submissions are easier to finish in the gi compared to no gi for the above reasons.
This doesn’t mean that you should avoid Omoplata’s in no gi though. 10th Planet member Richie Martinez is very good at attacking them from his Rubber Guard and has a high finishing rate. However, going one step further Omoplata’s are very rare in MMA which is probably because strikes from the top make the entries more difficult from the bottom.
Who has the best Omoplata?
The Omoplata was popularized by Nino Schembri. Here, Schembri had incredibly flexibility and is also credited with early variations of the Rubber Guard. With this said, he is often considered as the main pioneer of the Omoplata.
In terms of competition, there are very few specialists. As mentioned, in no gi – Richie Martinez has a very good success rate with the submission. Elsewhere, Clark Gracie has used it often in the gi as well as Bradley Hill, who is also known as ‘The Omoplata man’.
How to defend and escape the Omoplata
If you’ve read the above information, then you will be aware that there are several ways to defend and escape the Omoplata. The first way is to stop it in its tracks. If you can quickly posture up and pull your arm out, then the Omoplata cannot even begin. Of course, against skilled opponents this isn’t always realistic and also relies on a degree of strength.
The next step is a later defense when you’re put on the floor. Remember to keep you posture strong with your head, as standing to defend the Omoplata is easier than on the floor. Imagine standing with someone hanging on your arm…eventually gravity will tire them out.
If you do manage to posture then there are two escapes. The first is to jump your legs over them and hop into side control. If done correctly, you’ll have gone from one of the worst positions in BJJ to one of the best. Of course, this relies on getting your legs over the body of the opponent.
An alternate step is to do a forwards roll. Although this is a common escape, it’s also not as good as the above escape. The reason for this is that it can be followed up by the opponent rolling into another Omoplata. Alternatively, they can turn it into an Armbar, Triangle or Wrist lock from the top. Having said this, the roll escape is better than nothing.
Lastly, if you can’t escape at all then you can try freeing your elbow if the Omoplata isn’t tight. Against skilled opponents, this probably isn’t an option. However, this is possible against some, especially in no gi.
Is the Omoplata legal in Judo?
Omoplata’s are legal in Judo and have been done over the years in competition. With this said, you shouldn’t worry in attacking an Omoplata if competing. The issue with Omoplata’s in Judo is that they can be very difficult to get. Due to the time constraints of Judo on the floor, you may not have much time to set up or finish the Omoplata. This is the nature of Newaza in Judo and means some submissions are harder than others to finish.
What does the word Omoplata mean?
The word Omoplata originates from Portuguese. As Brazil speaks Portuguese as its main language, this is not surprising. Omoplata literally translates to shoulder blade. In other words, it’s not some weird, fancy name. Instead, it means to attack the shoulder blade. If the Omoplata is put on without the opponent submitting then the shoulder blade would eventually rip and tear. Hence the name Omoplata.
Using the Omoplata as more than just a submission
The Omoplata is like the Kimura, in that it is a tool as much as a submission. For example, if the opponent stands in your Closed Guard, then you can attack an Omoplata on a standing opponent. The likelihood is that you won’t finish it on a skilled opponent. Instead, it will probably result in a sweep instead. Like the Kimura, submissions aren’t always the end goal and sweeps are available too.
There is also a number of variations between the Omoplata and Kimura with similar names. Without going into too much detail, there’s the Baratoplata, Tarikoplata and Monoplata. These are all shoulder locks but have slightly different mechanics.
Perhaps the biggest attribute of the Omoplata though is the entries into the Crucifix from there. Basically, the Crucifix is a modified Omoplata which also controls the arm so the two are related. In other words, if you find yourself in an Omoplata, you can always switch to a Crucifix and vice versa. Going further, the Omoplata can also open up entries to take the back. By exploring this move, the possibilities are vast.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the Omoplata is a very versatile technique that is more than just a submission. Too often, it is sadly disregarded as too intricate to attempt on a regular basis. However, by understanding the controlling aspects then it becomes much easier. With enough endurance, you can eventually turn this move into a great tool. From there, you can use this in almost any situation meaning with enough learning, the Omoplata can really improve and change your game.

How To Master The Kneebar For BJJ And MMA
The kneebar is one of those submissions that gets a bad rep just because it is a leg lock. Kneebars are actually legal for brown and black belts and are among the best joint lock submissions you can get. Even better, a kneebar is available from a multitude of positions and can open up opportunities you never thought existed. Even if you’re a blue or purple belt, make sure you start learning how to execute the kneebar. See it as an investment in your brown and black belt future.
Simply put, the kneebar is the lower body analog to the armbar submission in BJJ. It works by applying force at the knee joint, in a direction opposite of it’ anatomical bend. The kneebar is actually a quintessential BJJ move. To perform it, you need to use your whole body against one isolated limb of the opponent. It is all about leverage and positioning, with a neat submission at the end. In all fairness, the kneebar is a really potent weapon that nobody should exclude from their arsenal. Even if you do not like to perform it, you need to learn it. Otherwise, you’ll have no hope of defending it.
Honestly, the kneebar is not that different from a heel hook, in the terms of potential damage. However, the crucial difference is the force requirement and global positioning during the kneebar. A heel hook takes next to no effort to finish with possibly devastating results. A kneebar requires a lot more force, and opponents and training partners can feel it coming long before it gets really dangerous. This joint lock puts a lot of pressure on you’re kneecap and can end a fight quickly. Practicing the kneebar requires common sense and following general safety rules. What you get in return is one of the most reliable leg locks in Jiu-Jitsu.
Tips On Safe Training
As already mentioned, the kneebar has the potential to cause very serious bodily harm. It is an incredibly versatile leg lock attack that you can use in competition. In No-Gi events, it is legal for all levels, while in the Gi and under IBJJF rules, only after the brown belt.
Training the kneebar should not be a dangerous undertaking. Actually, training it should not be different than training any other submission. The basic rules are easy: pay attention to what you’re doing and watch out for your partner. If you’re on the receiving end of the submission than make sure you tap on time. Actually, tap even before it is time.
It is important to keep in mind a few key details when training leg locks, and the kneebar in particular. To begin with, always make sure that you and your partner are attempting the move under the supervision of a qualified instructor. Do not go off attempting leg locks in your backyard with friends. That’s a great way to get seriously injured.
Even more important, understand that the kneebar does not only impact the knee. While the meniscus and knee joint ligaments are a target of the submission so are surrounding structures. In that sense, muscles like the hamstring can get thorn causing even worse injuries. Correct mechanics means that you’re minimizing the risk of injury, so pay close attention to how you should perform the move.
Finally, the kneebar is a gateway to plenty of other moves, mostly leg locks. Look to develop a complete game and include sweeps, passes, and other leg lock transitions off your kneebar attempts. That way, you’ll be able to train safer due to the fact you have opportunities instead of forcing just the one submission hold.
Details On Kneebar Execution
The knee is one of the largest joints in the body. Unlike other leg locks, like the heel hook and toehold, the kneebar can be applied with a certain level of force behind it without any dangers to the partner’s limb. In essence, the kneebar is a fairly safe and simple submission when you execute it correctly.
As with all other leg locks, the kneebar starts with correct body positioning. In other words, you need to obtain control over your opponent, before thinking about finishing. Ideally, you should have your body bent at 90 degrees in the knees and hips, respectively. This is the position that allows you to exert the maximal amount of power to finish the submission. It sets you up perfectly for a hip extension with a backward lean movement. To make more sense of the position, it is the same as with a basic BJJ bridge, only you’re on your side instead of your back.
Whenever you’re looking for a kneebar, make sure you do not have your body straight before you look to apply breaking mechanics. To really get the submission, look for the power position first. That way, there’s much more space to arch back and put your hips into the motion.
Another very important point is gripping. The foot of the opponent’s leg needs to be as close to you as possible. Actually, you need to have one arm around it and the fingers of the foot by the side of your neck. Placing the leg under your armpit is also a good finishing position. Head position is also crucial. For a tight kneebar, you need to use your head to trap the opponent’s foot on the bottom side. This allows for rotational control and results in pressure loading on the leg.
Kneebar Setups
The kneebar is a very versatile move that you can look for from virtually anywhere. From standing, through top position all the way to the guard, you can always set a kneebar up. The basic idea is to have a clear path so that you can correctly align your body with their leg. Once you see a potential route to the power position, you can think about hitting a leg lock. Let’s look at a few different setups from different positions.
This is probably the most common kneebar set up out there. Getting the kneebar from top half guard is actually not hard at all. Your opponent is the one that’s going to guide you towards the submission, all you need is to recognize when to transition into it.
From the half guard, top or bottom, you just need to know which leg you’re attacking. For a kneebar, it is always the opposite side leg of the one that you have in the guard. From the top, all it takes is a little step over with your free leg and a semi-spin. An opponent looking to sweep or underhook is only going to make this easier.
Whenever you’re up against an open guard you can go for the kneebar. It works best against open guard variations which include one leg on the outside. The De La Riva is a great example of this. Just like with the kneebar from the top half guard, you need a spin. Here, the spin is a little bigger, which means you’ll really need to drill it order to hit the kneebar efficiently.
This attack is extremely direct. In the worst case scenario, you’ll end up wit ha sweep. That means you cans still hit a kneebar but from the top. Whenever in the bottom of half guard, you once again need to attack the free leg. The idea is to take your knee shield leg over to the other side of your opponent. You’ll need to thread it past their hips. next, you need to invert in order to get the opponent’s weight over you. From there you’re already in position. You can either spin under or to your side and you’ll get teh tap!
The X-guard is one of the best positions for attacking the opponent’s legs. The position itself places you directly under your opponent. Furthermore, the control you have is over both legs, so you can choose whatever attack you want. For the kneebar, you’re going to look to attack the leg you’re controlling with your arm and shoulder. Simply get one foot off the opponent’s leg, and swing it over their other leg. The submission is just a little spin away. remember to go over your shoulder, so that you keep your neck safe.
This one is the most popular kneebar setup in Sambo. The Victor roll is a great option to get both a takedown and a submission right away. You’ll need to be at the correct angle, so it works best off failed judo throw attempts. It is also very effective when an opponent slides behind you on the feet. As long as their arms are around your waist, you can hit the Victor roll kneebar immediately. It works at the highest levels of competition and is especially useful in No-Gi.

e-mail: [email protected]",0.97253,Kneebar Mastery - A Step-By-Step Guide (BJJ & MMA) - Blinklift,https://www.blinklift.com/kneebar-guide/,"Step #5 - Twist your body. The 2nd part of the one quick motion is to twist your body. You want to step over the opponent while twisting your body. Spoiler alert, we're aiming for you to sit parallel to the opponent (facing the same direction) while having a solid grip over his knee.","Kneebar Mastery – A Step-By-Step Guide (BJJ & MMA)
I’m a big fan of leg locks in BJJ, especially the Kneebar. By learning it, you’ll be able to hone your grappling style and change your perspective. You’ll be able to be more unexpected and adapt to your opponents faster, meaning that you’ll be a much better grappler.
The Kneebar utilizes hyperextending the knee by stretching the entire leg backward. It’s an excruciating and uncomfortable submission, so your opponents will tap out quickly when you perform it correctly. You can also perform it from many positions, such as half guard, open guard, side control, and butterfly guard.
This article will be valuable to you because it can be your go-to walkthrough guide to perfecting this great leg lock. In addition, you’ll be able to skip many trials and errors because I review mistakes that many novice grapplers make when they first learn the Kneebar.
And, of course, I offer practical solutions to such mistakes.
As a result, you’ll be able to save a lot of time by experiencing these mistakes yourself. If you implement this submission correctly by using the steps I’m offering you in the following section, you’ll be able to perfect the Kneebar in no time (and win more fights using it.)
Here’s what this article will cover:
So I hope you’re ready to read a step-by-step breakdown of the Kneebar; it’s up next.
How to Perform the Kneebar
This 1st part of the article will be about breaking down the simplest variation of the Kneebar. Now why did I choose this variation particularly? Honestly, it’s the most straightforward one, and you’ll be able to learn and start using it in no time.
It’ll be better if you don’t start with the most complicated submission and dial it down from there. Instead, you want to start with the straightforward stuff and advance to the more advanced techniques later.
A video at the end will show this process through, so ensure you stick through to the end to grasp this technique better.
But for now, please stick with this variation. Start perfecting it, and you’ll see more results and more wins. So let’s dive into the first step.
Step #1 – Start in a crouching position
The first step will be to begin in a crouching position. You want your opponent to almost have the open guard on you, but a bit earlier than that. Once you’re in this position, you’ll be ready to advance.
Step #2 – Grab the knee
The next step is to grab the opponent’s knee. At this point, he’ll know what you’re planning if he’s advanced. In addition, he’ll know you’re going for a leg lock even if your opponent is a white belt, as you’re explicitly targeting the leg.
Some will suggest being more stealthy about it and going for an upper-body fake. However, it’ll be worth it not to go for it at your current skill level with the Kneebar.
Instead, focus on the leg.
You should grip the opponent’s knee by going under the leg and grabbing the top. You’ll have more control in the future by going about it that way.
Step #3 – Fake passing the opponent
The next step will be to fake passing the opponent. So I previously mentioned that you should not fake stuff; what has changed? This fake is critical to your success rate with this Kneebar variation.
You want to fake passing the opponent to get more wins using it. Being more stealthy and unexpected is almost always positive unless you go too far.
But ensuring you’re not overdoing it is a critical component of a solid grappler. By fake passing the opponent (you might want to start moving to the side, for example), the opponent will have no idea of your plans.
You can fake guard passing in many ways, such as going for the Knee Slice or the Toreando (although you’ll be crouched.) But you can stand up and fake going for the side using any pass you want.
And if you want to learn about BJJ’s best guard pass, follow this link.
Step #4 – Sit up while stepping over the opponent
Alright, so you should have a solid knee grip at this point. I want you to maintain it throughout the entire execution. You’ll see how your initial grip influences your finishing move at the end. But in short, the better grip you have, the more pressure you’ll inflict, and the faster the opponent will tap.
The following step is to sit while stepping over the opponent. You have faked a pass, and so the opponent is confused. Now in one swift motion, you want to step over the opponent and land facing the other direction.
But wait, I’m too far into the future.
Steps #4, #5, and #6 are one quick motion. Stepping over the opponent is the first of this combination. So now, let’s dive into #5.
Step #5 – Twist your body
The 2nd part of the one quick motion is to twist your body. You want to step over the opponent while twisting your body.
Spoiler alert, we’re aiming for you to sit parallel to the opponent (facing the same direction) while having a solid grip over his knee. Reach this position, and you’ll get the tap.
This is why I’m emphasizing that you must get this right. You want 4, 5, and 6 to be extremely quick. The opponent will escape or defend your offensive moves if you take your time performing them.
I’m all about being technical, but it’s not what our focus should be in this specific case.
Step #6 – Sit parallel to the opponent while gripping his knee
The last motion of the combination is to sit parallel to the opponent while maintaining a solid knee grip. To recap, you’ve grabbed the knee, stepped over while twisting in the other direction, and sat parallel to the opponent while maintaining a knee grip.
Great.
Again, you want to perform this motion swiftly. Please don’t hesitate with it, or the opponent will leave you vulnerable. If that happens, he can counter and follow up with his own submission. You want to avoid that.
But you’re not done yet.
Step #7 – Lean on your shoulder (lean back)
The next step will be to lean on your shoulder (leaning back, essentially.) Remember, you aim to hyperextend the opponent’s knee and cause much physical pain. Thus, you want to gain as much leverage as possible.
And gaining leverage and more control is difficult, especially if you’re not keen on learning more positions and techniques. But you’re reading this article, so you’re eager to learn more positions and learn more techniques.
Because you lean back, you have more space and leverage to hyperextend the opponent’s knee. Can you imagine submitting the opponent while sitting down and not having his knee entirely in your control? I can’t, but maybe you’ll be able to do that.
Eventually, you want to lean on your shoulder and maintain reasonable control over the opponent’s knee. Do that, and the last step is all yours (the finishing move.)
Step #8 – Hyperextend the knee (the entire leg)
The finishing blow will be to hyperextend the opponent’s knee. Reaching this step without facing any defense means from the opponent’s side can be difficult. However, with experience and practice, you can counter the opponent’s defensive moves.
For instance, the opponent might lock his legs when you lean back (last step.) That’s an obstacle you want to overcome. What do you do then? Your best shot will be to break his grip using your other hand or your feet. Your feet should be free to work so that they can help you in this case.
Another option you have is transitioning to another leg lock, such as the Toe Hold or Heel Hook. You can also go as far as transitioning to side control or even full mount if you see the opponent is overly defensive.
From there—you’ll be able to finish the fight by going for another submission, such as the Americana or any other side control finishing submission.
Hopefully, you’ve reached this final step and hyperextended the opponent’s knee. Another thing you can do to apply more pressure is to pinch the opponent’s foot while lifting his heel upward. That will create more leverage and pressure and allow you to get the tap out more effectively.
Indeed, a lot of pressure.
Step #9 – Wait for the tap
The last step is to wait for the tap. I always include this step in my breakthroughs for one simple reason: it can be easy to injure your training partner by not letting go of the pressure.
Or, perhaps you’ve been overly excited by getting the submission, and you applied too much pressure. I see such a case often with grapplers who have their first few tries with the Kneebar.
They’ll do everything flawlessly but slowly apply pressure (hyperextending the knee). They’ll be eager to finish the fight and grab the victory, so they’ll apply pressure quickly and not pay attention to the opponent.
Please be careful when performing the Kneebar; it’s highly effective and can seriously hurt someone.
On a more optimistic note, you’re now a grappler who can use the Kneebar to finish more fights using it. You’re essentially more competent.
It would be best if you didn’t wait before practicing this submission. After that, you’re ready to start learning and mastering it. But before you do that, the next section will discuss more variations you’ll enjoy learning.
Learning these variations will allow you to be a more dynamic grappler, capable of finishing more fights using Kneebars. So let’s dive in!
Kneebar Variations
The 2nd part of this article (this one) will be all about variations. I always include this type of section in my technique breakthroughs because I’m confident that learning more means improving.
Learning more is everything. Red belts in BJJ never stop learning. They’ve been training BJJ for over 60 years and admit not knowing everything. So how can you stop learning?
I encourage you to experiment with all these Kneebar variations, as all of them are highly effective leg locks.
Alright, I hope you’re ready for some hardcore (I wish) learning!
#1 – Kneebar From Butterfly Guard
The 2nd variation we’ll discuss is one of the most beautiful leg locks I’ve seen. What’s so fantastic about it is that it’s also highly effective. You can use it against novice and advanced grapplers, making it more attractive to all grapplers.
Without too much introduction, here’s how to perform the Kneebar from the butterfly guard:
I encourage you to learn this variation as soon as you learn leg locks. Although there are more accessible alternatives, such as the Straight Ankle Lock, you can experiment with both to keep honing your grappling skills.
#2 – Kneebar From Half Guard
The Kneebar from the half-guard position is a pretty complicated set of moves. However, once you get a feel of this variation, you can use it against multitudes of BJJ grapplers, including advanced grapplers.
You can only use the Kneebar from the brown belt, according to IBJJF (more on that later.) And so, at this point, you should be capable of performing it flawlessly.
Here’s how this variation plays out:
#3 – Kneebar From Open Guard
The Kneebar from open guard is a submission I think deserves its spot in the most beautiful BJJ techniques list. I think I’ll create this list and include this variation in there. Stay tuned for that! 🙂
Anyways, it’s also practical and will allow you to start submitting your opponents using it. Let’s see how you perform it yourself:
Alright, this is a complicated move. So here’s another demonstration (visual aid.)
Eventually, learning all these variations will help you become a competent grappler. Therefore, I invite you guys to read the following section, which will help you avoid common mistakes that novice grapplers typically make.
Even advanced grapplers fall prey to these mistakes, so here are 5 tips you want to implement into your leg lock game to perfect your Kneebars and win more fights using them.
Kneebar Tips (Win More Fights)
Alright, we reached the part of the article that’s about tips and fixing common mistakes.; how time flies!
You’ll be able to gain the knowledge to start implementing specific tips that’ll boost your leg lock game from this section.
The tips are essentially solutions to common mistakes novice grapplers make. Thus, ensure you read carefully since I always include another tip or offer you another solution to the same or other mistakes.
Tip #1 – Sit tightly to the opponent’s leg
The first tip is to sit tightly to the opponent’s leg. Many novice grapplers who learn the Kneebar create much space between themselves and the opponent’s leg.
What that does is allows him to maneuver his leg according to his desires. So, for example, he’ll be able to turn around and escape your lock. To put it another way, he’ll gain the fight’s advantage, as you’ll be more vulnerable than your opponent.
But if you sit tight and minimize the space between you and the opponent’s leg (the one you’re targeting), your lock will be tighter, making your execution more likely to work.
Tip #2 – Scoop back if the opponent defends
The 2nd tip (solution to a common mistake) is to scoop back if the opponent defends. Why should we do that?
Leaning back will create more space between you and the opponent. But how can that be any good? Well, there’s one primary benefit you’ll be gaining from scooping back and watching the opponent when he defends.
You’ll be able to identify weak points you can start attacking. The opponent can’t defend everything. He won’t be able to protect his leg and neck, or at least not proficiently. That’s good news because you can now attack more effectively.
Scooping back when he defends will give you a better view of the fight. Also, it’ll allow you to attack more precisely, which is what you want to do.
Tip #3 – Learn and experiment with all the variations
The next tip will be to experiment will all variations. You want to have as much knowledge as possible to be as dynamic as possible.
BJJ is like chess in that sense. However, learning more moves and entries will allow you to enter more smoothly and finish more fights.
You’ll become more unexpected.
Here’s a call to action: learn and experiment with all the Kneebar variations in this article. How do you do that? You start by learning one variation and trying it in a few spars. Then, you learn another one and follow it up with actual implementation. The same applies to all of them.
Now your body will start to develop muscle memory, and you become a grappler capable of using Kneebar like it’s his second nature.
That’s the beauty of effective learning.
Tip #4 – Use the opposite grip for more pressure
The 4th tip is to use the opposite grip or apply pressure from the other side to create more pressure when you finish the Kneebar.
How does that look, one might ask?
When you’re in Kneebar’s last step, to apply pressure, you have two options. The first is to apply the pressure from the direction that makes sense (the one that doesn’t require you to manipulate your arm.)
But you have a second option which will allow you to create more pressure and get the tap out quicker. This option is to come from the opposite side and apply pressure in the same direction.
That will allow you more pressure than the usual grip. Here’s how it looks:
Tip #5 – Fight for control (if the opponent defends)
BJJ is all about control. You must fight for that control if you want to improve your win-loss ratio. Your opponent will do anything to get a superior hand on you.
You want to do the same, especially with leg locks.
Your aim is to gain the superior hand, or more control, over your opponent. That will give you more options to maneuver him and you according to what you’re going for. For example, if you’re going for the Kneebar, you want to gain control over his leg, which is not easy to get.
BJJ really is like chess, and you want to control the fight as much as possible. Fighting for control will be worth it; trust me, the opponent will do the same. Following this tip will give you more wins!
Now, let’s move over to the last section of this article: Common Q&A
Which Martial Arts Teach the Kneebar?
MMA and BJJ teach the Kneebar, as both teach ground grappling. However, it originates from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, as it’s the primary source of knowledge about leg locks. MMA, however, has implemented leg locks into its martial art, as they’re a set of highly effective techniques.
What Belt Do You Have to Be to Kneebar?
You must be a brown belt to perform the Kneebar in BJJ legally. That said, some BJJ tournaments won’t restrict the techniques you use according to your belt. However, the IBJJF will restrict using most leg locks until you’re a brown belt.
Is the Kneebar Legal in IBJJF?
The Kneebar is a legal submission in official BJJ tournaments and IBJJF tournaments. That said, you can’t use it until you’re a brown belt, as you can seriously hurt your partner if you misuse it or apply too much pressure. You can use only one leg lock before that, the Straight Ankle Lock.
Final Words
This complete guide was hard to write. However, it made me step out of my comfort zone and start learning more, even though I already knew it.
However, I and probably you aren’t as proficient as we think we are. We must always strive for more learning, and this breakdown was my platform to learn more and become a more dynamic grappler, so there’s something to be proud of!
Eventually, the Kneebar is one of BJJ’s most effective leg locks. It’ll allow you to cause a lot of pain quickly. Therefore, there isn’t much to lose by learning this leg lock, although it can be frustrating to understand at first, as some of its variations are more complicated.
The Kneebar, however, isn’t the most effective leg lock. If you want to learn what are the most effective leg locks, follow this link.

The kneebar is among the most effective BJJ grappling and mixed martial arts submissions. It is a leg attack that has evolved to become one of many grapplers’ favorite moves.
A kneebar is a leg-aimed attack that causes knee hyperextension by pulling the leg and pushing the joint to the opposite side.
This article will teach you about the kneebar move in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, grappling, and MMA. It discusses the knee bar mechanism, setups, and positions, among other things. Keep an eye out!
What Is a Kneebar?
A kneebar is a leglock attack that tends to pressure the knee by pulling the leg and pushing the joint to the opposite side, causing knee hyperextension.
A powerful kneebar requires more than raw force. It all comes down to hip positioning and using your body as a fulcrum to limit your opponent’s leg mobility.
A slight misalignment may cause the kneebar submission to fail, so squeeze your knees and keep your opponent’s leg straight.
How to Do a Kneebar from Top Half-Guard?
The half-guard kneebar is one of the earliest knee-bar variations you should learn. It’s a simple and straight move you’ll love to go for whatever you can.
In the following video, Professor Gustavo teaches you how to do the knee bar from the half-guard position correctly. Indeed, Gustavo emphasizes the importance of proper positioning and control to execute the technique successfully.
How to Kneebar from the 50/50 Position?
The 50/50 is another fantastic position to hunt a knee-bar submission. In the following video, Lachlan Giles teaches you how to correctly do the kneebar submission from the 50-50 position.
How to Kneebar from the Turtle Position?
The turtle is one of the advanced positions in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. It is another fantastic position for an effective knee-bar submission.
In the following video, Tarsis Humphreys teaches you how to correctly do the knee bar from the turtle.
Kneebars in MMA
Kneebars are often utilized as a submission hold in MMA to submit an opponent. These may be performed from several positions, including the half-guard, etc.
As any submission holds, kneebars may be hazardous if not done correctly. Excessive pressure or keeping the hold for too long might result in catastrophic damage to the opponent.

Conclusion
A kneebar is a kind of submission hold widely utilized in BJJ grappling and MMA to induce an opponent to submit. A leg lock variation applies pressure on the knee joint, causing discomfort and perhaps significant harm.
A grappler usually wraps their legs around their opponent’s leg to do a kneebar. He then grabs their opponent’s leg with both hands and drives their hips forward, causing the knee joint to bend abnormally, forcing the opponent to tap out.
This puts a lot of strain on the knee and may result in discomfort, damage, or even tearing off the ligaments and tendons surrounding the joint.
Recommended: Most takedowns are brutal, putting a lot of strain on the knees. As a result, practitioners must carry reliable knee pads to protect their joints and avoid injury. Click here to learn more!

Heel Hook: Setups , Attacks, Defenses & Escapes
Apr 15, 2022
Table of Contents
The heel hook is a remarkable submission technique that is helpful in all sorts of grappling sports, including BJJ and MMA. This powerful technique has the potential to end a fight just like the knockout punches in boxing.
The use of heel hooks in BJJ has gone through many changes, the most recent being its re-emergence due to the efforts of the ultimate grappling duo: John Danaher and Eddie Bravo.
Today, the heel hook has become a necessity to succeed in no-gi ADCC competitions and Submission Wrestling. If you also want to take your jiu-jitsu game to the next level with this move, you have come to the right place!
This article breaks down every aspect of Heel Hook, including the best heel hook setup and attacks, the different ways to utilize this leg lock in your game, and methods to defend and escape from this deadly submission.
1. Heel Hook Set Ups
The heel hook is a leg lock submission that attacks the knee, foot, and ankle. It controls and isolates the knee in conjunction with the hips so that your opponent is unable to spin.
To perform a heel hook, first you need to form a leg entanglement in order to control your opponent’s legs and then apply rotational force to the heel to finish him/her off.
The heel hook is an extremely powerful move and it’s important that you learn the different setups in which you can use this move.
1.1. Heel Hook Set up From Half Guard
One of the setup in which you can use a heel hook is the half guard i.e. you’re lying on the top of your opponent with one of your opponent’s legs entangled. In this case, your opponent will be in half guard position while you will be in a half mount position.
If your competitor is going for a knee shield half guard, you have the advantage as his leg will already be bent.
Once in half guard, place your free knee on your opponent’s belly. Then fall back towards their heel and hold his heel by locking your grip.
If your opponent starts to defend by rolling, roll with him and finish the submission by twisting the foot.
1.2. Heel Hook Setup from Half Guard to Ashi Garami
Another setup to perform a heel hook is when you’re in a bottom half guard.
Start with a knee shield, placing the foot of your knee shield leg between your opponent’s legs.
Then reach over with both your arms and grab your opponent from behind his arm and knee (top hand: armpit, bottom hand: knee)
Use this grip to pull yourself underneath your opponent, move your top knee through to the other side and rotate into an Ashi Garami position.
To form the Ashi Garami position , rotate your body towards your opponent and push him away with both your top hand and knees. Pull his bottom leg with your free hand. Place your bottom foot on his hip (Ashi Garami position) and finish off with the heel hook.
1.3. Back Step to Heel Hook
Another great setup for heel hooks is to do a back step by faking a standing guard pass.
Start by taking control of your opponent’s head with one hand and grab his ankle with your other hand.
Then step your lead leg between your opponent’s legs and take a backstep with your back leg, placing your back leg outside of his other leg.
Finally, take your hand off your opponent’s head and grip under his knee. Slide in and hold their heel, finishing the move with a heel hook.
2. The Ultimate Heel Hook Attacks
2.1. Outside Heel Hook/Ashi Garame
One of the deadliest heel hook attacks in BJJ is the outside heel hook/ashi garami, illustrated by John Danaher in his outside heel hook master class.
This move makes use of the straight ashi garami in combination with the outside heel hook. The ashi garami acts as a control mechanism while the heel hook acts as a breaking mechanism.
2.2. Inside Heel Hook/Ashi Garame
Inside heel hook is one of the most formidable grappling attacks since it can destroy your opponent within seconds. The intrinsic nature of this move makes it an effective heel hook lock.
By twisting the heel, the attacker makes use of his strong back muscles against the opponent’s weak knee muscles. Due to its structural advantage, even beginners will be able to learn and implement this technique effectively.
2.3. Standing Heel Hook by Craig Jones
If you ever find yourself in a position where you don’t have enough time to pass, sweep or mount etc., A standing heel hook is the best option to beat your opponent.
This move is not only great for submission grappling tournaments but also for MMA and self-defense. Craig Jones is the master, able to pull off this interesting heel hook from a modified position.
To perform this attack, start by hooking your opponent’s leg above his knee with your legs off the ground. Then take an under hook and scoot toward the leg you’re controlling.
Then reach under your opponent to grab his foot and elevate him. Bring his bottom leg through, knees in, and tower over your opponent.
You will end up in a saddle position where you can finish the match with an inside or outside heel hook.
3. How to Defend & Escape the Heel Hook?
One of the most intimidating tasks in BJJ is to defend and escape heel hooks. Leg locks have gained popularity in recent times due to the “submission only tournaments” and more people have started to use them in No-Gi Competitions as well.
Most practitioners are afraid of heel hooks as they think that if they get caught in them, it will be too late to escape as their ligaments will likely already be damaged.
However, this is not true. There is plenty of time to tap without getting hurt after getting caught in a heel hook. The following are ways you can defend yourself without getting hurt.
3.1. Develop a Good Base and Posture
A good base and posture are useful in defending against heel hooks. In theory, it is not possible to finish the heel hook if you are standing with your foot still flat on the mat.
Having a good base and posture helps you to stop your competitor from sweeping you. Not getting swept is the first thing to do when dealing with troublesome heel hookers.
If you can develop a good posture and manage to keep an aggressive game, you will be able to defend against the heel hook effectively.
3.2. Do Hand Fighting
Another key element in defending against the heel hook is hand-to-hand fighting. Your opponent cannot finish the heel hook with only one hand and you can use this to your advantage.
Suppose that your opponent sweeps you even if you have a good base and posture, the first thing you should do is engage in hand-to-hand fight to achieve a 2 on 1 grip on your competitor’s wrist.
Taking hold of your opponent’s wrist is the key to survival when you’re already about to get heel hooked.
3.3. Clear the Knee Line
Once you have fallen and your opponent has started to attack with the heel hook, clearing your knee line can help you escape the attack quickly.
You must be able to clear the knee line, i.e. get your knee cap out from in between your opponent’s leg, for this tactic to work. If you’re about to get swept off your feet, try to fall in a controlled position where you can clear the knee line easily.
4. How to Escape Primary Heel Hook Positions?
There are three primary heel hook positions in which you will mostly find yourself entrapped during a match. Therefore, it is important to learn how to escape from these positions if you’re ever caught in such a situation.
The three primary heel hook positions are,
The position where your opponent extends your leg to perform the submission.
The position where your front leg is laced over your opponent’s leg and your back leg is placed behind his thigh
The position where your inside legs are interlaced with your opponent’s inside leg.
4.1. Escaping Ashi Garami Outside Heel Hook
To escape this heel hook position, you first need to identify the problem. You will notice that your body is tightly gripped by your opponent and need to escape his hold if you want to defend yourself.
To loosen your opponent’s grip, pull over his hands and hide your heel by turning it away simultaneously. You can also use your other foot to assist in the process if you’re facing any difficulties. Then, to prevent yourself from being controlled again, quickly step over your opponent’s hip.
Once you have escaped the heel hook, instead of running away, convert your defense into counter attack to win the match.
4.2. Escaping Honey Hole Heel Hook
To escape the mother of leg entanglements, i.e. the Honey Hole, you must have a lot of control. You need to hide your heel and get to your opposite hip to safely escape from this heel hook.
First, you need to separate your secondary leg by rotating your opponent’s arm inward. This will create enough space to allow you to free your leg. Make sure to keep this leg out of your opponent’s reach once it’s free so that he cannot regain control.
Then, to free your primary leg, you need to ensure that your knee is outside of the imaginary line connecting your hip and ankle.
Start by gripping at your opponent’s ankle. Then create a base and put weight on your primary leg. Place your foot on the mat such that your heel is facing upwards, free your knee line, and escape your opponent’s hold.
4.3. Escaping 50/50 Heel Hook
In the 50/50 position, you and your opponent are equally vulnerable to the hell hook. Whoever can hide his feet while effectively attacking the opponent’s feet will win in the end.
To escape from a 50/50 heel hook, you need to attack your competitor’s knee pinch and open his legs. This will allow you to shift your weight and pull your leg out of his grip.
5. Tips for Defending Heel Hook
Don’t be afraid of the heel hook and pay attention to the technique being used (inside or outside). Understanding the technique will help you learn what you need to do and enable you to plan your defense accordingly.
The key to defend from the heel hook is to prevent your leg from being pinned in the first place. No leg lock can be performed without having knee control. As soon as your knee clears the line of your competitor’s hip, you can relax and lean back.
If you end up being caught in a heel hook, instead of accepting the submission, take steps for damage control while keeping in mind the safety of your foot. Depending on the heel hook position, cross your feet, hide your foot under your opponent, or curl your leg, etc. The goal here is to make your opponent work hard for a grip, giving you enough time to defend against the heel hook
Once you’re in the grip and your opponent is going to put pressure on your leg, do not fidget to try and escape the entanglement. Instead, go hand-to-hand and get a 2 on 1 grip. The goal is to keep your opponent’s arm as far away from the foot as possible. Don’t forget to hide your feet while doing so.
If you feel that the pressure is becoming too painful for your leg, tap quickly without waiting for the opponent to finish the heel hook. While most martial artists think tapping out is bad, this is not the case. In fact, tapping out is a legitimate heel hook defense and is much better than walking around on crutches for months.

Picture a championship bout’s electrifying setting—a showdown between two titans of the grappling world. Just when it seemed that the young phenom, hailed for his impenetrable defense, was cruising to another victory, the tables dramatically turned.
For the first time in his illustrious career, he was ensnared in the grip of a heel hook, leaving the audience in collective awe. This moment wasn’t just a testament to the unpredictability of combat sports but also underscored the sheer potency of a technique that is often underestimated.
The heel hook—elegant in its execution but devastating in its impact—stands out as one of the most compelling submissions in the grappling arsenal. While it’s deeply rooted in martial arts history, its nuances remain elusive to many. Far more than just a showcase of raw power, the heel hook embodies the pinnacle of technique, strategy, and timing.
We will be shedding light on the intricacies of the heel hook, delving deep into its history, and mechanics.. Through understanding comes appreciation, and through appreciation comes mastery.
History of the Heel Hook
The roots of grappling and submission fighting extend back centuries, and with them come the precursors to techniques like the heel hook. Ancient civilizations such as Greece with their Olympic sport of Pankration showcased a myriad of submission techniques. Although detailed manuscripts are rare, some ancient illustrations depict warriors in positions that look reminiscent of leg entanglements.
Moving eastward, Japan’s traditional jiu-jitsu also hinted at the usage of leg locks, though the emphasis was predominantly on joint locks targeting the upper body. However, as samurai warriors required mobility, it’s plausible to believe they would avoid techniques that might cripple the legs.
But it wasn’t just the Greeks or Japanese who had glimpses of leg-based submission techniques. Various forms of wrestling across Europe and Asia, from the Lancashire catch wrestling in England to Mongolian wrestling, show instances where the legs were targeted, though perhaps not with the same intricacy as modern heel hooks.
As martial arts evolved and merged throughout the 20th century, the heel hook began to see more limelight, particularly with the rise of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). Initially, BJJ emphasized upper-body submissions, given the guard-based origins of the art. But as competitors sought new ways to secure victories, they began exploring leg entanglements more deeply.
The no-gi grappling scene, in particular, witnessed an explosion in the use and refinement of leg locks. The heel hook, with its devastating efficiency, quickly became a favored technique among competitors. The likes of Dean Lister and, later, the Danaher Death Squad, with figures such as Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan, would elevate the heel hook to new heights, demonstrating its potency in high-level competitions.
MMA was another arena where the heel hook found a home. While initially, many fighters lacked the technical acumen to defend against leg attacks, the heel hook’s effectiveness ensured that fighters started integrating it into their training regimes. Today, a well-rounded MMA fighter possesses both a good offensive and defensive game around this technique.
Despite its effectiveness, the heel hook’s potential for causing severe injuries has led some organizations and tournaments to restrict or outright ban its use, especially at amateur levels. This protective measure underscores both the move’s power and the importance of learning it safely and responsibly.
Anatomy 101: Why the Heel Hook Works
The leg, a complex structure of bones, muscles, ligaments, and tendons, serves as both a pillar of support and a tool of mobility for the human body. When dissecting the heel hook’s effectiveness, it’s essential to grasp the basic anatomy of the lower limb:
At its core, the heel hook is a rotational leg lock, applying torque to the ankle and translating that force up into the knee.
The heel hook’s danger lies in the body’s natural pain response. Unlike arm or wrist locks, where pain is felt sooner, the ligaments in the knee often don’t send pain signals until they’re critically damaged. This means by the time someone feels the need to tap, it might already be too late, resulting in significant injury.
The combination of the human anatomy’s natural vulnerabilities and the heel hook’s leveraging mechanics make it one of the most effective and, simultaneously, perilous submissions in the grappling world. As with all martial arts techniques, respect and caution are paramount.
Setting Up the Heel Hook
From Guard: Initiating the Heel Hook with Finesse
The guard, a fundamental position in grappling, can be a launching point for various submissions, including the heel hook. Let’s delve into setups from different guard positions:
the bottom, when your opponent tries to flatten you out, you can underhook their far leg. Using this control, you can off-balance them, swinging your outside leg over and transitioning into a leg entanglement, setting up the heel hook.
Transitions: Seamlessly Shifting into the Heel Hook
A heel hook doesn’t always start from a static position. Often, it comes alive mid-flow, transitioning from other moves:
Remember, the art of the heel hook is both technical and fluid. It requires understanding not just of the submission itself but of body mechanics, leverage, and the ability to read your opponent’s movements. Practice with care and always prioritize safety. With time, the heel hook can become a formidable tool in your grappling arsenal.
Defensive Strategies Against the Heel Hook
The battlefield of grappling is as much about the mind as it is about physical prowess. Awareness, in particular, is a grappler’s invisible shield.
Escapes
While awareness can prevent you from getting into precarious positions, sometimes the heel hook attempt is inevitable. Here’s how to navigate such waters:
of their grip.
The heel hook, while a potent weapon in the grappling arsenal, isn’t undefendable. By fostering acute awareness and mastering the art of escapes, you can not only protect yourself from this submission but also use the opponent’s attempt to your advantage, setting up counter-attacks or improving your position on the mat. Remember, as with all submissions, safety is paramount; always tap if you feel you’re caught, and live to grapple another day.
Safety First
In the realm of martial arts, the mats serve as both a training ground and a sanctuary. It’s here that practitioners pour hours into perfecting techniques and testing their limits. However, the beauty of these arts is not just in their effectiveness but also in the philosophy of mutual respect and care.
Safety in martial arts is a shared responsibility. While instructors set the tone, every individual on the mat plays a part in ensuring a nurturing and secure environment. By respecting the techniques, understanding their potency, and prioritizing safety over ego, the world of grappling becomes a place of growth, camaraderie, and lifelong learning. Always remember: in the journey of martial arts, it’s not about how tough you are, but how smart and respectful you train.
Tips on Integrating the Heel Hook into Your Game
The road to mastering the heel hook, like any other martial arts technique, is paved with repetition, understanding, and dedication. Drills are the most efficient way to ingrain a technique into your muscle memory, ensuring you can execute it flawlessly even under high-pressure situations.
The heel hook is a formidable weapon in any grappler’s arsenal. However, its power is not just in the submission itself, but in how seamlessly it’s integrated into one’s overall game. By dedicating time to drills and understanding the strategy behind its application, you can elevate your ground game, making the heel hook a natural and instinctive part of your repertoire.

FAQs
What is the heel hook in martial arts?
The heel hook is a submission technique in martial arts that targets the ankle and knee joint. By securing an opponent’s heel with one’s forearm and twisting it, the attacker applies torque to the ankle and rotational force on the knee, potentially causing severe ligament damage.
How is the heel hook different from other leg locks?
Unlike straight ankle locks or knee bars that apply linear pressure, the heel hook involves a twisting motion. This rotary force primarily threatens the ligaments of the knee, particularly the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), making it distinct in its mechanics and potential for injury.
Why is the heel hook considered a dangerous submission?
The heel hook is deemed dangerous due to the torque it applies to the knee ligaments, especially the ACL. Damage can occur quickly, often before the recipient feels significant pain, leading to severe and long-lasting injuries. This is why many grappling tournaments restrict or prohibit the move for certain divisions.
In which martial arts or fighting disciplines is the heel hook commonly used?
The heel hook is most commonly associated with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), submission grappling, and mixed martial arts (MMA). While BJJ schools may vary in their teaching of heel hooks (with some avoiding them for safety reasons), they are a staple in no-gi grappling and MMA.
How do you properly execute a heel hook?
To execute a heel hook:
What are the primary defenses against a heel hook attempt?
Key defenses include:
How can one train safely while practicing the heel hook?
To ensure safety:
What are the key positions to set up a heel hook?
Common positions include the inside or outside “ashi garami” (leg entanglement) and the “411” or “saddle” position. From these positions, the attacker can control the defender’s leg and set up the heel hook.
How effective is the heel hook in competition?
The heel hook is highly effective in competition, especially in no-gi grappling and MMA, where it’s allowed. It’s a game-ending move, and due to its potential for injury, competitors often tap out quickly once it’s locked in.
Are there any notable fighters known for their expertise with the heel hook?

Familiarity is important when training in BJJ, especially techniques like the heel hook. Both grapplers must have a firm understanding of the concept of of this technique to effectively utilize it on the mats. It is so powerful that apart from the submission itself, defending against it incorrectly can worsen its damage to the knee joint. While most practitioners refrain from training the heel hook, learning it will turn you into a menace on the mats. This article is your advanced and complete guide to the heel hook in BJJ.
The Inverted Heel Hook
The inverted heel hook is a powerful submission that can be applied from different types of leg entanglements such as the 50/50, inside and outside sankaku. It is considered the most powerful heel hook because the position of the opponent’s feet is more pliable, being turned inside than outside.
The inverted heel hook is powerful enough that you can get away with poor mechanics, even if you try to finish it facing down. Although in a fight or competition where the opponent is willing to take damage, poor application of the inverted heel hook won’t be enough. The inverted heel hook typically starts from the outside sankaku. Trap the opponent’s foot with a gable grip and focus on getting their toes towards your bicep and your wrist underneath the opponent’s heel. This is to prevent the opponent’s foot from slipping.
Let’s discuss leg control a little. Use your hips and pelvis to turn and rotate the opponent’s knee inside while turning their foot towards you with your grips. Get your hips and glutes off the mat to get better breaking leverage. Remember that the more space for your body to move, the stronger the breaking potential.
Of course, executing the heel hook by laying your back on the mat may sometimes work, but there’s not nearly as much pressure on the opponent’s knee. Push down with your legs and lift your hip and glute off the ground. Doing this imparts the weight of your hips and legs to the opponent’s knee, allowing you to rotate and lay weight on their knee. Keep in mind to maintain good connection with the opponent’s hip by pinning it down using your legs.
The Outside Heel Hook
Starting from the ashi garami position, place your outside foot on the opponent’s hip and the inside foot near their hamstring. Take note that your inside foot can be vulnerable to leg locks in this position; the opponent can reach in and attack your heel. To prevent this from happening, you can grab the opponent’s near hand and hide it.
Grab the outside heel hook grip by placing your wrist bone under the opponent’s heel and their toes under your armpit. Face downward and apply pressure by drawing the opponent’s toes back to their glutes. This usually prevents the opponent from rolling as opposed to ripping the heel across your chest.
If the opponent is bigger and manages to clear their foot and starts rolling away even with applied pressure, instead of following their trapped foot in their direction, place your foot outside and cross your legs outside on their hip. From this position, keep their heel to your wrist bone and your heel to their glute as you apply pressure for the break. If the opponent continues to roll, the pressure will get tighter, and the technique will turn into a belly down heel hook. Forcing the opponent to roll increases your chances of finishing the outside heel hook. This position stops the opponent from reaching your wrist and feet, which prevents them from defending.
Inside Heel Hook From Leg Across
The leg across position can be used to attack with the berimbolo, leg drag, or the inside heel hook. It is a position where you control an opponent’s leg by grabbing on their mid-shin area with a figure-four grip, placing your gripping hand near the back of their knee. Your bottom leg blocks the opponent’s far hip, while your top leg hooks behind their opposite leg’s knee, similar to X-Guard. The stability earned from this position will allow you to re-enter into leg entanglements.
Starting from the leg across position, when the opponent turns away to hide their heel, instead of out-turning the opponent by following them to their turning side to attack their heel, spin to the opposite side instead. This allows you to capture the opponent’s heel as it becomes exposed. To do this, you need space for your hips to lift. Pull the opponent’s leg up high to your armpit with the figure-four grip. This frees your hips to swing over the top. Use your free hand from the figure-four grip to hold the opponent’s knee up.
Lower your bottom leg from blocking their hip to their knee to pin their opposite leg on the ground. This prevents the opponent from pummeling their leg inside as you spin your hip through to their leg. Thread your foot through their leg and, while on top, bend their knee with your hand as you drop your hips down. As you land under their leg, follow with your knee coming tight – with your leg across their hip and below their hamstring. This exposes their heel and allows you to finish with the inside heel hook.
Conclusion
While learning the heel hook is pretty much a requirement in today’s modern game, it is important to note that you should be careful in using this technique, especially in the early stages of your study. It is capable of causing irreversible damage before the opponent can even react. Be careful when practicing with training partners who are unfamiliar with the technique, as they may try to fight it out and end up hurting themselves. Make it a habit to ask for the consent of your training partners before letting the heel hook come into play during training sessions to ensure everyone’s safety.

The Heel Hook: A Complete Guide
Heel hooks have become one of the prominent submissions in all of Jiu Jitsu.  But it wasn’t always this way.
For decades, heel hooks were banned from tournaments. They had a stigma for being too dangerous to use, but in modern Jiu Jitsu things are changing.
Today, heel hooks are practiced now more than ever and are now being allowed in more competitions. So, with heel hooks coming into the mainstream of Jiu Jitsu, you must know how to use and defend them.
This is one of the most complete heel hook guides you will find on the internet today. We’re going to give you everything from the history of heel hooks and how they work. Then we’ll detail numerous heel hook entries from different positions for you to go practice.
The History of The Heel Hook
The heel hook was developed thousands of years ago within ancient forms of grappling. Ancient wrestlers from Egypt, Greece, and Roman have all been documented using leg locks including the heel hook.
Everything from drawings, sculptures, and even martial art books depict and describe heel hooks being used. One of the earliest grappling forms that we know used heel hooks was the Greek based martial art of Pankration.
These techniques would be passed down for generations and adopted by numerous grappling arts. Jiu Jitsu would adopt heel hooks from Judo, but Master Carlson Gracie disagreed.
He claimed a Brazilian Vale Tudo wrestler he trained with named Ivan Gomes invented them. Although Gomes’ younger brother José said these claims were untrue.
From an interview BJJheroes did with José, Gomes claimed that he and his brother’s coach Zé Maria taught them. Then before that, their coach’s Judo coach from Japan, Takeo Yano. Another Japanese Judoka that migrated to Brazil and had a hand in establishing BJJ.
Heel hooks sort of fell into the shadows during the 1970s, when sport Jiu Jitsu started to take shape. Those submissions along with spinal locks and kneebars were banned from official competitions.
Since they couldn’t be used in competitions, many Brazilians stopped using them. These leg locks wouldn’t make a comeback until the late 90s, when the ADCC Championship was established. In those submission wrestling tournaments, all submissions were allowed including heel hooks.
With the creation of these types of events, heel hooks started to make a comeback. Then when the 2010s came around, their popularity exploded.
This was thanks in part to the emergence of more submission grappling tournaments and shows like the ADCC. Promotions like the Eddie Bravo Invitational, Polaris, and for a short time Metamoris allowed heel hooks in their competitions.
This led to an emergence of many BJJ stars that specialize in leg locks. They would come from BJJ teams like the Danaher Death Squad, Dean Lister, 10th Planet, and Absolute MMA began focusing on them.
Today heel hooks have come into the mainstream and changed the landscape of BJJ.
It must be noted that the heel hook can be seen in many other grappling arts such as catch wrestling, shooto, pankration and luta livre but the heel hook submission has really gained fame through Brazilian jiu-jitsu as the total amount of practitioners in BJJ dwarfs any other grappling art thus better help promote, evolve and develop the heel hook submission to be even more effective than that of the past.
How do Heel Hooks Work?
Many would assume with a name like heel hook that the submission would attack the heel of your opponent. What the submission actually targets is the knee of your opponent.
Before going into the submission, you set it up by establishing control over your opponent’s hip, knee, and foot. Once you’ve established control over those three points, you then bend their knee to around a 90 degree angle.
Putting your opponent’s knee at this angle creates tension on their joint. Then by turning into their leg and hook their heel this puts immense pressure on your opponent’s knee ligaments.
If your opponent does not tap or isn’t quick to tap, this will lead to immense damage to their knee. So be careful when you put this submission on.
Types of Heel Hooks
There are two types of heel hooks that are used in BJJ and submission grappling. The outside heel hook and the inside heel hook.
Between these two types of heel hooks, the more dangerous of the two is the inside heel hook. The reason for this is because the inside heel hook targets the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).
It also comes on faster than the outside heel hook. Although, the outside heel hook can also deal quite a lot of damage when put on.
The Legality of Heel Hooks in BJJ Competitions
For the better part of nearly 50 years, the heel hook has been banned by most BJJ federations. This includes the Confederação Brasileira de Jiu-Jitsu (CBJJ) and its international affiliate, the International Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Federation.(IBJJF)
The only major federation that allowed them was the ADCC when they formed in the mid 1990s. Within their trial events and of course the championship tournament.
If you wanted to use heel hooks in competition, your only real choice for the longest time was a NAGA event.(North American Grappling Association.) Even then, you had to sign up for the expert No-Gi level in order to be allowed to use them.
Although with the influx of BJJ pro shows that allow leg locks, things have begun to change. As of 2021 the IBJJF changed their long standing ban on heel hooks.
They now allow heel hooks for black belts and brown belts in the adult division.(18-29) This will definitely change the landscape of Jiu Jitsu going forward.
Notable Expert Leg Lock Competitors
Here is a list of the most notable expert BJJ athletes that are leg lock experts.
Leg Lock Positions
It’s not just enough that you know how to lock on a heel hook. You also must have knowledge of the different leg lock positions to get one. Here is a list of some of the most practiced leg lock positions.
The Heel Hook Techniques
Now that you know a little about the history of heel hooks and how they work, here are various entries. Read each carefully, so you don’t miss any of the details.
Outside heel hook from Ashi Garami
The outside heel hook from the normal Ashi Garami position is one of the first you need to learn. Before you go for the heel hook, you need to establish control over your opponent’s leg.
Your inside knee closes on top of your opponent’s hip and your outside foot attaches above your knee. The foot of your inside leg also needs to hook under your opponent’s far leg.
This connection creates a triangle above your opponent’s knee and you’re basically stuck to them. Now with your opponent’s legs under control, you can now fish out their heel.
Place your outside foot on the mat as you hold behind their knee and turn in to expose their heel. You can now go into your heel hook grip.
Trap your opponent’s toes under your arm as you hook their heel using the blade of your wrist. Then connect your hands together and keep your elbows tight.
Then to finish the move, keep your grip and turn their heel to the inside using your whole body.
Inside heel hook from 50/50
Footlocks like the inside heel hook are really easy to get from the 50/50 position. But while it is really easy it can be dangerous if you’re not careful and easy to defend.
Remember that 50/50 entails that your opponent also has your leg and can also finish you. Also if your hips are square with your opponent’s, they can easily fight your grips.
When you’re in position, grab your heel hook grip and turn on your inside hip. Your opponent’s heel is facing the floor and you have their knee bent.
Finish your inside heel hook from 50/50 raising your hips up and turning their heel outward.
Inside heel hook from the Saddle position
Another popular position to land an inside heel hook is from the saddle position. This is where your outside leg comes across your opponent’s leg and you triangle your legs above their knee. Along with your triangle, your inside foot hooks under your opponent’s far leg.
Remember like always to establish control above your opponent’s knees before going for your heel hook. Hold the position by chopping down with your top leg and pulling your opponent’s leg in with your inside leg.
Doing these two movements together closes space.
Now to put on your heel hook grip, fall to your outside hip as you pull behind your opponent’s knee. This movement causes their knee to bend and exposes their ankle.
Keep your grip behind your opponent’s knee as you trap their foot with your armpit. From here, hook their heel using the blade of your forearm, clasp your hands together, and turn in.
Heel hook from top half guard
Heel hooks can be set up from more positions than just from a bottom position like a guard. You can set them up from the top and one of the easiest places to land one is in half guard.
Start the position up with good posture and place your free knee across your opponent’s belly. Next, you’re going to grab behind your opponent’s and pull their leg into you as you fall to your back.
When you land, your opponent’s knee is bent and their heel is exposed. Hook their heel and go to finish your outside heel hook.
Even if they roll, it puts you right in position for a kneebar.
411 heel hook entry
This 411 entry into the heel hook starts from on top faking a guard pass. From standing with your opponent sitting, you start the entry by stepping in between your opponent’s legs.
Then you immediately do a back step with your other foot around your opponent’s leg. Your outside knee slides under your opponent’s leg as you scoop their leg with your elbow and fall back.
As you fall, your forearm pushes into your opponent’s leg to bend it and expose their heel. Hook the heel and turn out to get the tap.
Floating Z guard to inside heel hook
Starting from the Z guard is a great way to get in position for a heel hook. In the Z guard, underhook your opponent’s leg as you swim behind their arm and palm their armpit.
Use your underhook and hand to push your opponent away and make them base on the mat with their hands. Next, you need to loop your inside leg around your opponent’s body.
You can do this by keeping your frame on their armpit and turn in to make space to pass your leg.  Once your leg passes over, you’re going to shoot your hips to the sky and rotate your hips out.
Then after you rotate your hips, triangle your legs together and keep your opponent’s knee on the mat. From here, your opponent’s knee is bent, so all you have to do now is catch their heel.
Trap their foot with your armpit and hook your wrist around their heel, put your hands together, and finish.
Imanari roll to heel hook
By far one of the craziest entries into a heel hook is the Imanari roll. This absurd move on paper shouldn’t work, but it is extremely surprising and effective.
The move starts with both you and your opponent standing. You step and turn away from your opponent for a split second. This bit of misdirection gives you the space to go into your roll.
You fall to your back as your outside leg goes under your opponent’s legs and hooks behind their far leg. At the same time, your inside leg goes around the leg you’re attacking and also hooks behind their far leg. Right under your other leg that is hooking your opponent’s leg.
The momentum of the roll along with your legs hooking your opponent’s far legs trips them up. They fall to their back and you end up right in position to get an inside heel hook.
Important Key Details for The Heel Hook
The heel hook may be the most powerful joint lock in all of grappling when done correctly. Here are the important key details you must remember when locking them on.
The three points of control: When you go for a heel hook, you must remember the three points of control. Those points of control are the hip, knee, and foot. If you do not control these three parts of your opponent’s leg, you are unlikely to get your submission.
Hip alignment: Your hips must be aligned with your opponent in order to bend their leg and close space. Being unaligned with your opponent’s hips opens up space between you and them.  Significantly decreasing your chances of getting your heel hook.
Knee Control: To be successful at any leg lock, you must establish control right above your opponent’s knee. This control above the knee holds their leg in place and allows you to set up your submission. When you don’t have control above their knee, they can easily push their leg free.
Foot Control: Remember to use your tricep and armpit to trap the top of your opponent’s foot. Doing this isolates their heel, allowing you to use your forearm to hook it.
Bend the knee: The opponent’s knee must be bent at an angle in order to land a successful heel hook. Either use your hand or leg to bend their knee to the inside or outside. Depending on your leg positioning and whether you want an inside or outside heel hook.
Turn your body into the heel: To hook your opponent’s heel, you turn your body into your opponent’s foot. You do this, so you can isolate your opponent’s foot and heel before locking in your submission.
The grip: The heel hook grips you can use include the palm on palm, butterfly grip, reverse butterfly grip, and RNC grip. Choose the one that works best for you.
Elbows in: Do not flare your elbows out once you lock your grip. Keep your elbows in, so it makes it more difficult for your opponent to break your grip.
The Finish: After locking in your grip, slowly turn away from your opponent’s heel. Turning on the top of your back as you slightly lift your hips and rotate.
Be Careful!: The heel hook can severely damage the knee of the person you use it on if you’re not careful. When practicing the heel hook, always remember to put it on slow, so you don’t  injure your training partner. A knee injury from a heel hook can put someone on the shelf for 6 months or more.
How to Defend The Heel Hook?
To be an expert at heel hooks, you not only need to know how to put them on, but also defend them. Here are the important steps you need to remember for defending a heel hook.
Turn your toes down: When your opponent starts to go for the heel hook, the first thing you must do is extend your toes. Doing this movement makes your heel smaller and harder to grab. More experienced grapplers can still get your heel, but doing this will buy you time to escape.
Keep leg straight: You need to keep your leg stiff in straight whenever your opponent goes for a heel hook. This is because they need to bend your knee in order to get an angle and expose your heel.
Never Fall Back: If your opponent is attacking your legs, the worst thing you can do is fall to your back. Doing this gives your opponent the space they need to control your leg and bend it. You’re basically giving your opponent a heel hook when you fall back.
Free your knee: To break your opponents control, you need to free your knee. When they have control above your knee, they can go to any leg lock they want including a heel hook. Try opening your legs or pushing your opponent’s legs below your knee to get it free.
Hand Fight: Hand fighting is extremely important when you’re trying to defend a heel hook. Your opponent needs to connect both of their hands around your heel in order to get it. If you hand fight with your opponent, this prevents the sub and gives you time to escape.
Foot on the mat: To defend an outside heel hook, try to keep your foot on the mat. Keeping your foot attached to the mat hides your and buys you time to free your knee.
Roll out:  Rolling out of a heel hook works for both inside and outside heel hooks. Hold your opponent’s knee, step over their leg, and turn into the heel that’s being attacked. Never roll away from your heel being attacked, because this gives your opponent the heel hook.
Tap: If you are a novice at defending heel hooks, your best option is to tap out and try again. Heel hooks come on instantly and trying to fight out of it will only lead to your knee being severely damaged.
The Heel Hook in MMA
The heel hook is an extremely effective submission with mixed martial arts having been performed successfully since the mid 90’s.
The first real use of heel hooks were within Japanese pancrase and MMA events where it was very common to see fighters go for heel hooks and successfully submit the opponent. The first heel hook in the UFC was performed by Ken Shamrock (a former Pancrase fighter) on Pat Smith with Pat Smith tapping in excruciating pain.
Since that first heel hook there have been many fights ended with this devastating leg submission and to this day the heel hook is a very effective and feared MMA submission as it is quick, dangerous and effective.
In Conclusion
Many different grappling styles teach the heel hook and for a good reason, it simply works. The heel hook has seen a major evolution as of late within BJJ and Submission grappling due to the vast amount of competition the submission has been used in thus forcing new tactics and attacks in order to optimize the heel hooks effectiveness. The heel hook has also shown the effectiveness of BJJ for MMA as it is a true equalizer when placed correctly.
The heel hook is a must know submission and we highly recommend you perfect both attacking and defending the hell hook as once mastered, you truly have a highly effective submission in your arsenal.

The 2nd variation we'll review in this part is the Heel Hook from 50/50. If you aren't familiar with the basic pre-leg lock positions, I recommend following the link to read about the absolute must-know pre-leg lock positions.. Anyways, here's how you perform the 50/50 variation.","BJJ 101: The Heel Hook – Complete Breakdown
The Heel Hook is one of BJJ’s most effective leg locks. Many grappling trainees and masters use it, as one, to defeat their opponents quickly. This leg lock works on all levels, including novice and advanced grapplers, by allowing you to submit the opponent unexpectedly (targeting the leg.)
The Heel Hook is a highly practical submission that will make the opponent exceptionally uncomfortable, as you can inflict tons of physical pain using it. I recommend asking someone you trust to try it on you to understand its capacity to inflict pain. You’ll see how unbearable this experience can be.
And also, it’s fairly easy to learn, making it more attractive to people starting with leg locks. So, alright, let’s now discuss what this article will do for you.
This article can be your go-to guide to perfecting the Heel Hook. Unfortunately, most novice grapplers will make the same mistakes when learning this leg lock. Well, I’ll save you a lot of time experimenting with it by telling you what to look out for and how to fix these mistakes.
You’ll be able to learn the basic steps and variations and fix the common mistakes most novice grapplers (and some advanced ones) make. And trust me, it’ll save you a lot of time.
In short, here’s what we’ll go through in this leg lock breakdown:
How to Heel Hook
Alright, fellas, I’m glad you joined me in our journey to perfecting the Heel Hook. This submission can be extremely painful if you perform it correctly. You’ll notice how your opponents tap out remarkably fast when you perform it appropriately.
You’ll learn a trick to apply pressure differently, allowing you to manipulate the opponent’s leg and make it that much more painful.
So, without further introduction, let’s dive into the step-by-step guide to performing the Heel Hook correctly.
Step #1 – Start standing up
The first step is to start standing up. I know I know; what can I say about this step? Well, there’s already a mistake many novice grapplers make in this step.
Many novice grapplers allow their opponents to get into their closed or open guard positions before they even start targeting the leg. Therefore, you want to start thinking about the Heel Hook when you have more space between you and the opponent.
You’ll need to break the opponent’s closed guard and pass it if he gets into it. So you want to avoid that at all costs.
So remember, if the opponent is in closed or even open guard, you’re not in the best position to perform this leg lock. So instead, start performing it before that happens.
Step #2 – Step forward
The 2nd step will be to step forward. You want to be closer to the opponent now. He’ll likely be able to get into his closed guard if you hesitate in this step.
So once you step into the opponent’s safe zone, you want to start working quickly.
You probably have noticed that leg locks, in general, are very technical. However, you also want to act quickly, as the opponent will be able to react and leave you vulnerable if you take your time. So make sure to start performing the next step right after stepping forward.
Do that—and your win-loss ratio will skyrocket when you use the Heel Hook.
Step #3 – Grab the opponent’s foot
The 3rd step will be to grab the opponent’s foot. This is the first step you’ll take to gain control over the opponent’s leg. You’ll soon create space between you and the opponent to isolate the leg eventually.
The first step in every BJJ submission is to isolate the body part you’re going for. So, for example, you want to isolate the opponent’s arm if you’re going for the Kimura or Americana.
The same applies here. You must isolate the opponent’s leg in order to perform the Heel Hook. The opponent can resist your offensive means if you don’t separate it, such as by using his hands or hips to escape.
You want to use the grip by catching the foot (grabbing it from the side that’s not facing you.) Indeed, the grip you want to use will get you most of the control. It’ll most often be by grabbing it from the side that’s not facing you. That’ll give you more leverage to work with later on.
BJJ is like chess. It’s all about control. To control the opponent, and the fight is yours. The grip that’ll help you do that is an overhook of the heel. Try it and see how much more control you have rather than gripping it from the side facing you.
Step #4 – Create space by using your other leg
The 4th step’s purpose is to allow you more space to work with. Again, your aim is to isolate the opponent’s leg (as previously mentioned.) Therefore, you want to remove all possible distractions, such as the other leg, head, and arms.
You want to push the opponent’s other leg with your other leg. So let’s say you target the opponent’s right leg, and you want to use your right leg to push his left leg back. The space you’ll create in this swift motion will allow you to get the Heel Hook more often.
Of course, if you target the opponent’s left leg, you want to use your left leg to push away his right leg.
Finally, the best grip you can use in this instance is by pushing down on the knee. That’s the most suitable way to do it without giving yourself too much trouble pushing, especially if your training partner is bigger than you.
Step #5 – Push the opponent’s other knee down
The next step will be to push the opponent’s other knee down. You’ve created space in the last step. Now we want to create even more space so that you can isolate the opponent’s leg smoothly.
You’ll see many novice grapplers who skip this step to perform the submission as soon as possible. Well, that is a reasonably rash decision they make, as they’re more likely to mess it up than get it right.
So you want to ensure you create as much space as possible. And if you see the opponent making a wrong move and wish to utilize it, go ahead and do that. Create another step that’ll eventually help you finish the submission efficiently.
Step #6 – Lean back
The next step will be to lean back. This is the isolation maneuver you want to perfect, as it’s here that you’ll grab the opponent’s leg and lean as far back as possible.
By now, your training partner should know what you’re up to. So, you want to lean back quickly while advancing to the next step quickly. You’ll see why that’s important in a second.
Leaning back will allow you to isolate the opponent’s leg. All that’s left now is to attack.
Step #7 – Wrap your leg around the leg you’re targeting
This step is all about locking the opponent in place. You want to ensure the isolated part (his leg) can’t move. You want to close it as firmly as possible to prevent any movement.
Your opponent might roll, and that’s alright. You can follow his rolls to ensure you stay in place. If he rolls to the right, your roll to your left. If you want to learn more tips like that to become more successful with leg locks, follow this link.
Step #8 – Lock your legs together
So in what way do you wrap your legs? Your leg should already be wrapped around the opponent. What’s left for you is to bring your other leg over the isolated leg and lock them together. You’ll have a lock similar to the closed guard, preventing the opponent from escaping your Heel Hook.
Now that you’ve locked your legs, the opponent can maneuver himself out of your dominant position. As a result, you can utilize your superior position to advance in the steps and continue outperforming your partner.
Typically, novice grapplers won’t skip this step since it’s common sense that a firm lock will determine whether the opponent can escape.
So if you’re a novice grappler, ensure you grasp all the steps well before moving forward.
Step #9 – Turn to the side
Turning to the side here isn’t something you see that often. However, your goal is to create as much pressure as possible. Therefore, bending the opponent’s leg (what we’re doing by turning to the side) will allow you to create more force.
So after you lock your legs together, you want to turn to the side. Not skipping this step will be worth it, allowing you to finish more fights smoothly.
Once you lock your legs, it’s all about pressure. So ensure you keep this step in mind when you’re just about to finish the Heel Hook.
Step #10 – Lock your hands (cable grip)
The 10th step is to lock your hands around the opponent’s leg. Then, as the name Heel Hook suggests, you’re about to drive extreme amounts of force on the opponent’s heel.
You’ll bend the opponent’s leg (more on that later) to eventually create more pressure. But it would be best to forget that your opponent can still resist. He can resist because he has leg muscles (which are particularly strong.)
But you can use your entire body to resist his resistance (mind the pun) and finish the move. You will need, however, to lock your hands together for that to happen (if you want your arms to help you.)
Step #11 – Turn your hips in the direction of the opponent’s leg
By this step, you’re finished with the Heel Hook setup. Now we want to apply as much pressure as possible on the opponent’s heel. How do we do that?
Well, we first want to turn our hips toward the opponent’s leg. That will bend his leg, allowing you to advance to step #12 and finish the submission.
Step #12 – Turn your upper body in the other direction
The 2nd part of the finishing blow will be to turn your upper body in the other direction. Doing so will create immense leg pressure, forcing the opponent to tap.
Be cautious when turning your upper body, as that will drive most of the pressure, forcing the opponent to tap out. Observe your partner’s reaction. Release all pressure immediately when he taps out; don’t wait for him to get injured.
Step #13 – Wait for the tap
So yes, the last step will be to wait for the tap. Leg locks can be extremely dangerous because there’s a thin line between finishing the fight and permanently injuring the opponent.
That’s why white belts don’t learn leg locks. However, leg locks are highly effective, so you must use them cautiously.
Once the opponent taps, release all pressure immediately.
So this was the step-by-step breakdown. Let’s advance to the following part, variations you want to know to become a better grappler.
Heel Hook Variations
This part will be about the different variations you want to learn when you master the Heel Hooks. Learning all of them will allow you to become a more competent grappler, capable of using a lot of entries and fight approaches.
Alright, so without further ado, let’s dive into the first one.
Variation #1 – Heel Hook From Closed Guard
The Heel Hook from the closed guard is a highly effective variation. It’s also beautiful, so I’m a big fan of it.
I recommend starting learning it after you experiment with the variation we’ve broken down in the 1st part of the article.
It’s the simplest one that will build a solid foundation when you learn these variations.
Variation #2 – Heel Hook From 50/50
The 2nd variation we’ll review in this part is the Heel Hook from 50/50. If you aren’t familiar with the basic pre-leg lock positions, I recommend following the link to read about the absolute must-know pre-leg lock positions.
Anyways, here’s how you perform the 50/50 variation.
Variation #3 – Standing Heel Hook
The standing Heel Hook is the variation we’ve broken down in the 1st part of the article. So I don’t think I need to expand further, as you probably have seen the number of words I wrote on it. But, hopefully, you guys have understood the force you now hold in your hands.
You can break someone’s foot by using this technique. You can also dislocate someone’s knee using this standing Heel Hook. Please be careful when applying pressure.
In MMA fights, the fighters don’t release pressure until the referee tells them to. They don’t want to risk not winning the fight, so they usually injure their opponent badly when they perform any leg lock, especially the Heel Hook.
Anyways, the standing variation should be the first one you learn. You want to do anything in your ability to build a solid foundation going in the future. And learning the simplest variation will help you do that.
Variation #4 – Heel Hook From Open Guard
The last variation will discuss the Heel Hook from the open guard position. Now starting, the 2nd variation will also be from the open guard. But they’re different.
This is much quicker to execute, as the process has fewer steps. However, it’s also more complicated than the standing Heel Hook. Let’s see how you can perform it yourself:
Remember, stick with the 3rd variation as the first one you learn for quicker results (quicker results = more motivation = more results.)
Before diving into the fundamentals of the Heel Hook, follow this link if you want to learn about the Kneebar, another extremely effective leg lock.
Heel Hook Tips
The next part will be about tips to perform the Heel Hook flawlessly. You want to perfect your execution, so you can finish more fights using it.
These tips solve the mistakes most novice grapplers make when first learning the Heel Hook.
I recommend implementing each tip at a time and building muscle memory for them. You won’t be able to do so if you’re implementing them all simultaneously.
Tip #1 – Twist the opponent’s legs
The first tip is to twist the opponent’s legs before applying pressure. What this accomplishes is more pressure when you finish the submission.
The Heel Hook is a mighty leg lock that will allow you to cause a high amount of physical pain and force the opponent to tap out.
Twisting the opponent’s leg will eventually bend his leg, allowing you more turning pressure when you turn your body and wait for the tap.
Tip #2 – Roll with the opponent
The 2nd tip will be to follow the opponent when he rolls. Your opponent will want to escape your leg lock. You want to do anything you can, not allow him to do that. The most common escape method is to roll and sweep the isolated leg out of the lock.
And what’s the best response to that escape method from the offensive part, one might ask? That’s to roll with the opponent and go for the finish. You can roll for several minutes, but the opponent will stop after a few rolls.
You want to utilize that and go for the finish between rolls or when he gives up.
Tip #3 – Lack of friction (sweat)
When you’re fighting, especially in MMA (shirtless), your opponent and you will sweat. Now that can be more detrimental than you think. What sweat does is make you more slippery?
Now that’s good and bad. It’s positive because you’ll be more evasive, but the opponent will be too. So you will be required to react to that and be prepared for the opponent’s legs to be more slippery. Rolling and escaping your leg lock, then, will be easier.
Tip #4 – Learn all the variations
The 4th tip is to learn all the variations. The Heel Hook can be quite complicated, especially all the variations other than the one we’ve broken down in the first part.
Learning all the variations will be helpful because you’ll become a more dynamic fighter. Being dynamic is everything in self-defense and fighting. Likewise, you’ll know how to face different opponents—from other martial arts—and beat them by using the most suitable Heel Hook variation.
Tip #5 – Understand each step’s purpose
Each step has a purpose. You don’t want only to memorize them, but you also want to understand where each step comes from. Your proficiency will skyrocket if you grasp what the moves and techniques are here to do.
For example, when you push the opponent, you create space. Then, if you find any other way to create space, you can use it. As a result, you’ll be able to be more unexpected that way—and thus—become a more adaptive grappler.
Understand the purpose of each move in the Heel Hook, and you’ll understand the technique and be well on your way to perfecting it.
How to Set Up the Heel Hook
Setting up the Heel Hook isn’t complicated. What you first need to do is learn the variations. Then, depending on the variation you’re going for, the first step will be different each time.
So let’s say you’re going for the open guard variation; you want to begin by being in the bottom and the guard position. So the setup this time will be to enter the open guard.
So let me clarify another point: you must learn various pre-leg lock positions. For example, the Saddle, 50/50, and the Ashi Garami are some of the most common.
Knowing these will help you get the leg lock submission more often. So definitely go ahead and try them out yourself. Here’s an excellent video that demonstrates some of these pre-leg lock submissions.
Final words
The Heel Hook is an exceptionally effective leg lock, perhaps the most effective one. Therefore, you want to learn it when you’re starting to learn leg locks, and when you attain the brown belt is a perfect time.
You’ll suddenly become capable of targeting the opponent’s lower body and creating more offensive entries. By this point, on the other hand, you should already be familiar with leg lock defensive moves. So you want to focus on the offensive side of things.
Writing this guide was a lot of fun because it forced me to keep learning more about the beautiful art of BJJ. It also forces me to step out of my comfort zone and challenge my current knowledge.
This is what Blinklift is about. It’s about learning and improving yourself while remaining humble and challenging your current beliefs and values. So hopefully, you’ll keep learning from this blog and Blinklift’s YouTube channel.
Although the Heel Hook is definitely a top leg lock in BJJ, there are others you must learn to call yourself a competent grappler. Follow this link to learn about BJJ & MMA’s best leg locks you must learn.
