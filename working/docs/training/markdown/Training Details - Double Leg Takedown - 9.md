| 0.88 | 3.20 | 4.08 | i understand you"re afraid to shoot |
| 2.56 | 3.12 | 5.68 | everyone"s afraid to shoot experienced |
| 4.08 | 3.68 | 7.76 | rustlers understand |
| 5.68 | 4.00 | 9.68 | shooting takedowns towards the legs is a |
| 7.76 | 3.76 | 11.52 | high risk high rewards operation |
| 9.68 | 3.36 | 13.04 | the high reward is you get the opponent |
| 11.52 | 2.32 | 13.84 | on the ground you"re on top or you can |
| 13.04 | 3.28 | 16.32 | create force |
| 13.84 | 3.36 | 17.20 | and they can"t you have maximum options |
| 16.32 | 2.32 | 18.64 | the risk is |
| 17.20 | 3.28 | 20.48 | if you get stuck underneath you"re |
| 18.64 | 2.80 | 21.44 | supporting all of your weight and all of |
| 20.48 | 2.24 | 22.72 | their weight |
| 21.44 | 3.92 | 25.36 | so you"re potentially shooting into a |
| 22.72 | 4.16 | 26.88 | deficit there is one single technique |
| 25.36 | 2.72 | 28.08 | though that can erase a lot of this fear |
| 26.88 | 2.96 | 29.84 | for you it"s called a peek out |
| 28.08 | 4.16 | 32.24 | it"s very accessible and you only have |
| 29.84 | 4.64 | 34.48 | to learn it to one side |
| 32.24 | 3.28 | 35.52 | this can take out a ton of your |
| 34.48 | 2.72 | 37.20 | apprehension |
| 35.52 | 3.36 | 38.88 | when you"re first learning wrestling or |
| 37.20 | 4.16 | 41.36 | grappling all together |
| 38.88 | 4.16 | 43.04 | just learn how to peek out and when you |
| 41.36 | 4.72 | 46.08 | shoot into your deficit |
| 43.04 | 4.00 | 47.04 | that can become the setup for your peek |
| 46.08 | 4.16 | 50.24 | out your failed |
| 47.04 | 5.52 | 52.56 | shot becomes the setup for a successful |
| 50.24 | 4.24 | 54.48 | back take |
| 52.56 | 3.28 | 55.84 | all right so the peek out i take a bad |
| 54.48 | 3.28 | 57.76 | shot or my opponent just has a really |
| 55.84 | 3.28 | 59.12 | good reaction and they sprawl my way in |
| 57.76 | 3.36 | 61.12 | there will be a split second |
| 59.12 | 4.32 | 63.44 | a moment usually there will be a moment |
| 61.12 | 5.12 | 66.24 | where both arms are draped over my torso |
| 63.44 | 4.64 | 68.08 | allowing me an opportunity to peek out i |
| 66.24 | 4.48 | 70.72 | take a shot |
| 68.08 | 4.72 | 72.80 | alex and we"re in this position right |
| 70.72 | 3.92 | 74.64 | bad deficit i"m supporting all my weight |
| 72.80 | 4.00 | 76.80 | all his weight he"s supporting none all |
| 74.64 | 4.08 | 78.72 | i have to do is quad hot up |
| 76.80 | 5.68 | 82.48 | whatever your lead leg is that"s the leg |
| 78.72 | 3.76 | 82.48 | that"s going to cross diagonally |
| 82.72 | 6.24 | 88.96 | sit to your hip and the adjacent arm |
| 86.32 | 3.60 | 89.92 | is going to windmill my elbow is going |
| 88.96 | 4.40 | 93.36 | to windmill |
| 89.92 | 3.44 | 93.36 | above his elbow |
| 96.56 | 3.44 | 100.00 | really simple movement very nuanced get |
| 99.76 | 2.96 | 102.72 | in |
| 100.00 | 5.36 | 105.36 | here and really feel your elbow reach |
| 102.72 | 4.56 | 107.28 | towards his armpit |
| 105.36 | 3.52 | 108.88 | if i"m in here i need to elevate my hip |
| 107.28 | 2.96 | 110.24 | so i can have room to sit through it"s |
| 108.88 | 1.84 | 110.72 | not enough to just try and hit it from |
| 110.24 | 2.00 | 112.24 | here |
| 110.72 | 3.52 | 114.24 | you need to create space because he"s |
| 112.24 | 3.84 | 116.08 | got weight on you it will drop |
| 114.24 | 3.84 | 118.08 | as you sit through if i go to here |
| 116.08 | 4.88 | 120.96 | you"re just going to squish me |
| 118.08 | 4.96 | 123.04 | i need to create space for my hips some |
| 120.96 | 3.76 | 124.72 | guys like to sit to their shin |
| 123.04 | 3.52 | 126.56 | right they think that it creates more |
| 124.72 | 4.24 | 128.96 | mobility for them to turn in |
| 126.56 | 3.68 | 130.24 | some guys like to sit to their hip |
| 128.96 | 2.96 | 131.92 | because it gives me a little more of a |
| 130.24 | 3.92 | 134.16 | level change on my way down i personally |
| 131.92 | 5.20 | 137.12 | like to sit to my hip |
| 134.16 | 4.72 | 138.88 | hips come up quad pod slide underneath |
| 137.12 | 4.88 | 142.00 | and as i slide |
| 138.88 | 6.16 | 145.04 | my elbow goes high into his armpit in |
| 142.00 | 6.16 | 148.16 | this windmill motion and my elbow throws |
| 145.04 | 4.32 | 149.36 | down to the ground it"s a whipping |
| 148.16 | 2.72 | 150.88 | motion |
| 149.36 | 3.92 | 153.28 | if you hit it right if you time it right |
| 150.88 | 4.32 | 155.20 | he should fall right here to his hands |
| 153.28 | 3.52 | 156.80 | and when he does all you have to do it"s |
| 155.20 | 4.48 | 159.68 | as simple as turning |
| 156.80 | 4.88 | 161.68 | covering taking the back we go from an |
| 159.68 | 3.92 | 163.60 | extreme deficit |
| 161.68 | 10.16 | 171.84 | to an extremely advantageous position |
| 163.60 | 8.24 | 171.84 | and taking it back |
| 172.97 | 4.12 | 177.09 | [Applause] |
| 173.99 | 3.10 | 177.09 | [Music] |
| 182.84 | 3.00 | 185.84 | so |
| 190.56 | 3.36 | 193.92 | one last thing you don"t want to get too |
| 191.84 | 5.20 | 197.04 | far outside your opponent |
| 193.92 | 6.00 | 199.92 | as i"m peeking out my head |
| 197.04 | 4.32 | 201.36 | peeks out and he slides off the side of |
| 199.92 | 3.04 | 202.96 | my shoulder |
| 201.36 | 3.28 | 204.64 | i don"t want to have any distance here i |
| 202.96 | 4.08 | 207.04 | want this space to be close |
| 204.64 | 4.32 | 208.96 | so when i go to turn into him i have a |
| 207.04 | 5.36 | 212.40 | short distance to cover |
| 208.96 | 6.08 | 215.04 | if i peek out and i sit |
| 212.40 | 4.16 | 216.56 | really far that"s too far away now i |
| 215.04 | 4.16 | 219.20 | gotta tape now his hips are gone by the |
| 216.56 | 2.64 | 219.20 | time i turn in |
| 220.56 | 7.28 | 227.84 | inches or miles here stay close |
| 230.24 | 5.52 | 235.76 | a lot of times your peek out can turn |
| 232.88 | 6.24 | 239.12 | into a setup for a double leg |
| 235.76 | 7.28 | 243.04 | to sort of re-shot from this position |
| 239.12 | 6.56 | 245.68 | so i"m in i go to peek out and his hips |
| 243.04 | 3.44 | 246.48 | fall into me my shoulder lands near his |
| 245.68 | 2.32 | 248.00 | hips |
| 246.48 | 3.36 | 249.84 | depending on his movement depending on |
| 248.00 | 4.08 | 252.08 | the number of things you may end up here |
| 249.84 | 3.20 | 253.04 | but since we practice our double leg our |
| 252.08 | 2.64 | 254.72 | traditional double |
| 253.04 | 3.60 | 256.64 | we know how to finish we just post off |
| 254.72 | 4.40 | 259.12 | this far leg and |
| 256.64 | 4.00 | 260.64 | drive and this is how you implement this |
| 259.12 | 3.36 | 262.48 | into stance and motion you don"t even |
| 260.64 | 4.88 | 265.52 | really need a partner to hit this |
| 262.48 | 7.36 | 269.84 | shoot your partner sprawl pop up with |
| 265.52 | 4.32 | 269.84 | turning cover |
| 278.88 | 2.88 | 281.76 | this is definitely something that you |
| 280.08 | 2.48 | 282.56 | can drill at home if you want to get |
| 281.76 | 2.24 | 284.00 | good at this |
| 282.56 | 3.44 | 286.00 | if you really want to reduce the fear |
| 284.00 | 3.60 | 287.60 | and apprehension you have with shooting |
| 286.00 | 3.44 | 289.44 | get a hundred of these in a day guys |
| 287.60 | 2.56 | 290.16 | it"s no secret with any technique with |
| 289.44 | 2.16 | 291.60 | any skill |
| 290.16 | 3.04 | 293.20 | it"s no secret how you get good at |
| 291.60 | 4.48 | 296.08 | things you drill them |
| 293.20 | 4.88 | 298.08 | you practice a lot the more you drill |
| 296.08 | 4.48 | 300.56 | the more time you the more focused |
| 298.08 | 4.40 | 302.48 | dedicated time you commit to a task the |
| 300.56 | 3.12 | 303.68 | better you will get at it there"s no way |
| 302.48 | 4.24 | 306.72 | around it |
| 303.68 | 4.40 | 308.08 | set a timer commit to 100 reps a day and |
| 306.72 | 4.24 | 310.96 | then just get it done |
| 308.08 | 3.60 | 311.68 | get a partner you can rely on or maybe |
| 310.96 | 3.12 | 314.08 | you have to |
| 311.68 | 3.76 | 315.44 | use three four partners in a day because |
| 314.08 | 2.64 | 316.72 | they can only dedicate a certain amount |
| 315.44 | 2.48 | 317.92 | of time |
| 316.72 | 3.60 | 320.32 | what is it going to take for you to get |
| 317.92 | 3.04 | 320.96 | better what do you have to do to get |
| 320.32 | 2.16 | 322.48 | better |
| 320.96 | 4.08 | 325.04 | all right you can have excuses or you |
| 322.48 | 5.44 | 327.92 | can have results |
| 325.04 | 4.40 | 329.44 | commit to getting good at takedowns one |
| 327.92 | 2.88 | 330.80 | note of caution guys some people can |
| 329.44 | 2.80 | 332.24 | like to peek out so much they"ll |
| 330.80 | 2.40 | 333.20 | actually start deliberately shooting |
| 332.24 | 2.56 | 334.80 | into a deficit |
| 333.20 | 3.68 | 336.88 | they"ll start shooting onto their hands |
| 334.80 | 4.08 | 338.88 | and knees because their their number one |
| 336.88 | 3.76 | 340.64 | priority is to get to the peak out never |
| 338.88 | 4.24 | 343.12 | do that we want to have our a game to be |
| 340.64 | 4.32 | 344.96 | shooting clean through to a takedown |
| 343.12 | 3.84 | 346.96 | the peek out allows us to have a solid |
| 344.96 | 4.40 | 349.36 | backup plan if we don"t get that |
| 346.96 | 3.28 | 350.24 | you never want to aim to be underneath |
| 349.36 | 2.40 | 351.76 | an opponent |
| 350.24 | 3.20 | 353.44 | supporting all of their weight and your |
| 351.76 | 4.00 | 355.76 | weight at the same time we never want to |
| 353.44 | 3.60 | 357.04 | aim at deficits but we want to have |
| 355.76 | 2.64 | 358.40 | solid backup plans |
| 357.04 | 3.92 | 360.96 | for when that happens the peek out |
| 358.40 | 3.20 | 361.60 | allows that grab a partner and go back |
| 360.96 | 2.08 | 363.04 | and forth |
| 361.60 | 2.96 | 364.56 | and talk to each other as you"re doing |
| 363.04 | 2.96 | 366.00 | it when you get a really good repping |
| 364.56 | 2.72 | 367.28 | when the defensive partner who"s having |
| 366.00 | 3.52 | 369.52 | the technique hit on them |
| 367.28 | 3.20 | 370.48 | when you can feel that your partner just |
| 369.52 | 2.56 | 372.08 | hit a really good rep |
| 370.48 | 3.12 | 373.60 | talk about it what happened there where |
| 372.08 | 2.16 | 374.24 | was the elbow position where was your |
| 373.60 | 2.16 | 375.76 | knee slide |
| 374.24 | 3.28 | 377.52 | did you go down to your hip did you go |
| 375.76 | 3.04 | 378.80 | down to your butt on that slide what |
| 377.52 | 3.12 | 380.64 | happened there try to just |
| 378.80 | 4.48 | 383.28 | try to dissect exactly what happened |
| 380.64 | 5.28 | 385.92 | become aware of your technique |
| 383.28 | 3.76 | 387.04 | make each other better okay be |
| 385.92 | 4.08 | 390.00 | deliberate |
| 387.04 | 4.56 | 391.60 | be aware in your drilling don"t just do |
| 390.00 | 3.12 | 393.12 | mindless drilling don"t just go through |
| 391.60 | 4.08 | 395.68 | the motions |
| 393.12 | 4.16 | 397.28 | have hyper focus that"ll pay dividends |
| 395.68 | 2.48 | 398.16 | down the road you"ll get much better |
| 397.28 | 3.60 | 400.88 | much quicker |
| 398.16 | 4.66 | 402.82 | having deliberate practice other than |
| 400.88 | 5.06 | 405.94 | mindless |

learn it to one side this can take out a ton of your apprehension when you're first learning wrestling or grappling all together just learn how to peek out and when you shoot into your deficit that can become the setup for your peek out your failed shot becomes the setup for a successful back take all right so the peek out i take a bad shot or my opponent just has a really good reaction and they sprawl my way in there will be a split second a moment usually there will be a moment where both arms are draped over my torso allowing me an opportunity to peek out i take a shot alex and we're in this position right bad deficit i'm supporting all my weight all his weight he's supporting none all i have to do is quad hot up whatever your lead leg is that's the leg that's going to cross

them to turn in some guys like to sit to their hip because it gives me a little more of a level change on my way down i personally like to sit to my hip hips come up quad pod slide underneath and as i slide my elbow goes high into his armpit in this windmill motion and my elbow throws down to the ground it's a whipping motion if you hit it right if you time it right he should fall right here to his
