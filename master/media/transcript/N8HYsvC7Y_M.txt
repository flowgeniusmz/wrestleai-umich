down two points are awarded and also the activity clock still going on here so a challenge [Applause] Brick by Valencia's Corner action started in the center of the mat continue the action off the mat so the continuation he can is a should be a two-point takedown down here now I could be wrong but in my opinion it started in bounds and it continued out of bounds two points for Brooks Valencia did a great job of Defending it as a step out but then continued passed so the call is changed one point on the stepout so we don't go to part and the activity period continues here you see the arrow next to Aaron Brooks's name that means he holds criteria right now as the last Point scored val9 2020 on the last one right hand pull by Brooks activity period still going and one point on the stepout and one point on for red for the activity period so three to one for Aaron Brooks Two Step out or two step outs and an activity period expiration so three 3 to one here with 1 minute 5050 seconds to go nice left arm swing single feet to back four points [Applause] awarded very similar though to what happened over there and a brick thrown for Brooks he just wants to step out but again the action started on the inside went all the way out just like I thought it was with Brooks and Valencia when he he got the one-point step out but he did go to his back on the other mat so could be a four-point feetto back exposure nice run down by Valencia here let's see when his foot stepped out four point blue confirmed you saw he was going towards his back when he stepped out so four points is the right call now 6 to3 for Zed Valencia with 1 minute 43 seconds and he has a four-point hold which makes a huge difference at the end of the bout if everything is equal so Brook's going to need to pick up his Pace here with 1 minute 35 seconds to go Brooks now stalking Valencia has had a great tournament with that left arm swing single and he has caught Marell and Brooks stepping on that side there it is again then changes Direction Valencia to the left arm high crotch Valencia gets long and uses his length so Brooks can't control his hips to get exposure points under a minute to go here 6-3
