| 0.06 | 4.32 | 4.38 | all right so I"m gonna go over my system |
| 1.62 | 4.17 | 5.79 | on top there"s a couple concepts that |
| 4.38 | 4.23 | 8.61 | you just want to keep consistent when |
| 5.79 | 4.89 | 10.68 | you"re in top position those are for me |
| 8.61 | 4.68 | 13.29 | keeping my hands inside keeping pressure |
| 10.68 | 4.35 | 15.03 | forward on my opponent and keeping my |
| 13.29 | 3.54 | 16.83 | opponent"s weight on his hands if I can |
| 15.03 | 3.09 | 18.12 | do those three things that I"m gonna be |
| 16.83 | 2.91 | 19.74 | able to hold the guy down I"m gonna be |
| 18.12 | 5.78 | 23.90 | able to ride them I"m gonna collect my |
| 19.74 | 7.89 | 27.63 | writing time and after that be able to |
| 23.90 | 6.67 | 30.57 | bring the guy down get turns and score |
| 27.63 | 5.28 | 32.91 | some points so for me I always have to |
| 30.57 | 4.59 | 35.16 | stop you guys first move before I look |
| 32.91 | 3.57 | 36.48 | to turn him okay because all the whistle |
| 35.16 | 2.97 | 38.13 | guys are explosive they"re trying to |
| 36.48 | 4.50 | 40.98 | explode up they"re trying to get to |
| 38.13 | 4.68 | 42.81 | their feet and for me if I can stop |
| 40.98 | 3.66 | 44.64 | their first move and kind of settle them |
| 42.81 | 4.71 | 47.52 | down then I have a lot better chance to |
| 44.64 | 5.94 | 50.58 | turn okay so the way that I stopped |
| 47.52 | 5.07 | 52.59 | first move right off the whistle all |
| 50.58 | 4.35 | 54.93 | right my hands are coming inside just |
| 52.59 | 4.31 | 56.90 | like this I like my front hand to come |
| 54.93 | 5.94 | 60.87 | up in the armpit this hand come down |
| 56.90 | 7.21 | 64.11 | inside of me for a pride the next thing |
| 60.87 | 6.18 | 67.05 | I"m gonna drop my chest back and drive |
| 64.11 | 4.77 | 68.88 | and get pressure forward that"s gonna |
| 67.05 | 3.63 | 70.68 | put his weight on his hands so this is |
| 68.88 | 4.77 | 73.65 | where I want to be right here I"ll pull |
| 70.68 | 4.77 | 75.45 | my toes drive it into the guy one hand |
| 73.65 | 3.78 | 77.43 | on the pride other hand up in the armpit |
| 75.45 | 4.17 | 79.62 | okay kind of keeping this guy extended |
| 77.43 | 4.47 | 81.90 | if he"s in a ball if he"s sitting back |
| 79.62 | 5.10 | 84.72 | like this guys like this are really hard |
| 81.90 | 4.14 | 86.04 | to ride so I got a driver board I want a |
