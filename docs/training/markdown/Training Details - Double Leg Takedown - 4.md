| 0.03 | 3.57 | 3.60 | all right so this next position is a |
| 2.19 | 4.23 | 6.42 | really tough defensive position |
| 3.60 | 5.13 | 8.73 | especially because you don"t have very |
| 6.42 | 5.07 | 11.49 | many options when a guy shoots a double |
| 8.73 | 4.17 | 12.90 | leg he has he has your legs wrapped or |
| 11.49 | 3.30 | 14.79 | he has his legs locked there"s gonna be |
| 12.90 | 4.11 | 17.01 | a little bit different things that I"m |
| 14.79 | 4.65 | 19.44 | going to try to do anytime a guy tries |
| 17.01 | 5.22 | 22.23 | to shoot a double leg I"m always trying |
| 19.44 | 4.92 | 24.36 | to meet his hips okay I"m always trying |
| 22.23 | 5.31 | 27.54 | to meet his hips so it gets you to |
| 24.36 | 6.39 | 30.75 | double-a here I"m trying to I"m trying |
| 27.54 | 5.70 | 33.24 | to knock him off balance okay as I"m |
| 30.75 | 5.52 | 36.27 | knocking him off balance my goal is |
| 33.24 | 4.53 | 37.77 | again create namely if he only if he |
| 36.27 | 5.07 | 41.34 | doesn"t have his hands lock and he"s |
| 37.77 | 5.58 | 43.35 | like this this is great because now I |
| 41.34 | 4.02 | 45.36 | can try to turn this into a single leg |
| 43.35 | 4.56 | 47.91 | so I knock him with my hips and then I"m |
| 45.36 | 5.01 | 50.37 | gonna turn and I"m gonna try to give him |
| 47.91 | 3.42 | 51.33 | I"m gonna try to give him the angle to |
| 50.37 | 2.61 | 52.98 | his backside |
| 51.33 | 3.30 | 54.63 | so I"m going to turn and try to give him |
| 52.98 | 4.35 | 57.33 | the angle that back side most of time |
| 54.63 | 5.04 | 59.67 | guile hang on once I"m in this position |
| 57.33 | 4.74 | 62.07 | I can pretty much be sure that he"s not |
| 59.67 | 4.83 | 64.50 | gonna double it there"s two options I |
| 62.07 | 4.62 | 66.69 | can push his hand down or I can pull his |
| 64.50 | 4.20 | 68.70 | hand up pulling his hand up so a little |
| 66.69 | 4.11 | 70.80 | risky reason that"s a little risky is I |
| 68.70 | 3.84 | 72.54 | pull my hand up he can just lock right |
| 70.80 | 3.27 | 74.07 | under my butt cheeks and then go for a |
| 72.54 | 4.64 | 77.18 | double leg takedown this way he can just |
| 74.07 | 7.56 | 81.63 | run me down if I push down this way I |
| 77.18 | 6.46 | 83.64 | force him to attack more play okay so he |
| 81.63 | 4.47 | 86.10 | shoots a double leg I"m meeting with my |
| 83.64 | 4.44 | 88.08 | hips boom and I turn the corner here now |
| 86.10 | 4.92 | 91.02 | I"m gonna push that wrist off and rest |
| 88.08 | 4.44 | 92.52 | on this position okay now now once I"m |
| 91.02 | 4.04 | 95.06 | here we"ll go back to those single leg |
| 92.52 | 5.30 | 97.82 | defenses by square himself |
| 95.06 | 4.38 | 99.44 | on the corner okay so when you"re when |
| 97.82 | 3.72 | 101.54 | someone is shooting that double leg you |
| 99.44 | 4.74 | 104.18 | have to be you have to anticipate where |
| 101.54 | 5.10 | 106.64 | they"re going so if I if he shoots and I |
| 104.18 | 5.01 | 109.19 | try to back up and he can get his hips |
| 106.64 | 5.13 | 111.77 | in he"s just gonna run me down okay |
| 109.19 | 4.14 | 113.33 | I"m in trouble I need to get into him on |
| 111.77 | 4.53 | 116.30 | this and this is one of the cases where |
| 113.33 | 5.19 | 118.52 | I"m not running away I don"t want to run |
| 116.30 | 5.22 | 121.52 | away from a double I want to get into |
| 118.52 | 5.07 | 123.59 | him and take away his anger so I"m in a |
| 121.52 | 4.23 | 125.75 | good stance he goes to shoot boom |
| 123.59 | 4.14 | 127.73 | get into him and take away angry right |
| 125.75 | 3.84 | 129.59 | here force him into a similarly now once |
| 127.73 | 5.19 | 132.92 | he the single a we can wrestle |
| 129.59 | 5.46 | 135.05 | okay another option this guy shoots a |
| 132.92 | 4.29 | 137.21 | double leg he brings his trail leg up |
| 135.05 | 4.89 | 139.94 | I"m gonna fall |
| 137.21 | 5.73 | 142.94 | see how I"m starting to fall to his lead |
| 139.94 | 5.64 | 145.58 | leg I"m gonna fall to his lead leg and |
| 142.94 | 5.43 | 148.37 | as I"m falling I"m looking to get to my |
| 145.58 | 6.06 | 151.64 | crotch lift okay body credible I"m gonna |
| 148.37 | 6.90 | 155.27 | go outside hip under the butt cheek here |
| 151.64 | 6.87 | 158.51 | and as I"m here I"m gonna drive my toes |
| 155.27 | 6.89 | 162.16 | into this leg five my toes into this leg |
| 158.51 | 7.26 | 165.77 | and wrestle through this position okay |
| 162.16 | 5.47 | 167.63 | I"m most of the time guys shirts he gets |
| 165.77 | 3.42 | 169.19 | crushed up he"s gonna he"s gonna bail |
| 167.63 | 5.07 | 172.70 | that leg out he"s not gonna want to be |
| 169.19 | 6.84 | 176.03 | in that position and when he does it"s |
| 172.70 | 5.16 | 177.86 | not here here give me the help and now |
| 176.03 | 4.11 | 180.14 | I"m in a good position but it"s all |
| 177.86 | 6.48 | 184.34 | about running your feet he shoots |
| 180.14 | 6.63 | 186.77 | I"m gonna run my feet out and around I"m |
| 184.34 | 5.16 | 189.50 | not gonna try to run this way right I"ll |
| 186.77 | 5.07 | 191.84 | pop and twist this way to get that off |
| 189.50 | 4.65 | 194.15 | but if he has a really good double a I"m |
| 191.84 | 6.27 | 198.11 | gonna lean my feet are gonna chop this |
| 194.15 | 4.88 | 199.03 | one feet are going to chop that way I"m |
| 198.11 | 3.86 | 201.97 | trying to me |
| 199.03 | 4.62 | 203.65 | I"m trying to break his his position |
| 201.97 | 2.76 | 204.73 | he"s trying to take me this way I don"t |
| 203.65 | 3.75 | 207.40 | want to go that way |
| 204.73 | 5.79 | 210.52 | I want to lean over top his head so I |
| 207.40 | 9.69 | 217.09 | bring my chest I put my arm over the |
| 210.52 | 11.01 | 221.53 | back of his head here we get to the |
| 217.09 | 7.38 | 224.47 | backside okay so one more thing with |
| 221.53 | 4.47 | 226.00 | this position is this guy"s getting |
| 224.47 | 3.03 | 227.50 | really strong again if I can get over |
| 226.00 | 4.53 | 230.53 | that far knee but better |
| 227.50 | 5.64 | 233.14 | so I rotate him then I go that way so if |
| 230.53 | 6.57 | 237.10 | I rotate them first and then drop off to |
| 233.14 | 6.60 | 239.74 | that side my ability to score goes up if |
| 237.10 | 4.56 | 241.66 | I wrote if I circle this way and then |
| 239.74 | 4.47 | 244.21 | try to go look how much greater position |
| 241.66 | 4.86 | 246.52 | he"s I"m in trouble so I can"t rotate |
| 244.21 | 13.91 | 258.12 | the way he wants rotate |
| 246.52 | 16.11 | 262.63 | I can"t I can"t go back step I need okay |
| 258.12 | 5.92 | 264.04 | now again the double eggs really hard |
| 262.63 | 4.14 | 266.77 | because he"s got bull he"s not my hips |
| 264.04 | 4.59 | 268.63 | all the way locked in so what I need to |
| 266.77 | 5.19 | 271.96 | think about is where am I going to put |
| 268.63 | 6.36 | 274.99 | his head okay I mean there"s one option |
| 271.96 | 4.59 | 276.55 | take two hands push his head away he |
| 274.99 | 3.03 | 278.02 | starts driving in I have to have a |
| 276.55 | 4.26 | 280.81 | really good balance on my feet so go |
| 278.02 | 4.41 | 282.43 | ahead and try another leg here see I |
| 280.81 | 4.62 | 285.43 | pushed that head away and try to get |
| 282.43 | 5.85 | 288.28 | those legs away that"s my best option if |
| 285.43 | 4.32 | 289.75 | he"s super deep like most of the time |
| 288.28 | 3.75 | 292.03 | I"m a guy soon he"s gonna be trying to |
| 289.75 | 3.57 | 293.32 | lift you up off the mat so if he"s here |
| 292.03 | 4.41 | 296.44 | he"s probably gonna stand and lift |
| 293.32 | 3.93 | 297.25 | just go ahead lift double a if my feet |
| 296.44 | 3.06 | 299.50 | come off the ground |
| 297.25 | 4.02 | 301.27 | I"m in trouble you cannot let your feet |
| 299.50 | 3.15 | 302.65 | come off the ground absolutely not only |
| 301.27 | 4.26 | 305.53 | if you come off the ground when he |
| 302.65 | 5.79 | 308.44 | shoots you got to play them in and you |
| 305.53 | 5.61 | 311.14 | got to think pressure into this guy |
| 308.44 | 5.34 | 313.78 | pressure into this guy get his head away |
| 311.14 | 4.65 | 315.79 | get his head away punch him in the ribs |
| 313.78 | 6.57 | 320.35 | down lock in the ribs slide down to the |
| 315.79 | 6.12 | 321.91 | left look for my score so you have to |
| 320.35 | 6.00 | 326.35 | meet his pressure when he shoots a |
| 321.91 | 7.29 | 329.20 | double eight boom shimmy-shake get that |
| 326.35 | 4.98 | 331.33 | hip open now once I"m here I wrestle the |
| 329.20 | 4.25 | 333.45 | single way any time you shoot a double I |
| 331.33 | 4.89 | 336.22 | try to make him wrestle Singh way |
| 333.45 | 5.24 | 338.69 | sometimes what will happen is I"ll punch |
| 336.22 | 4.53 | 340.75 | here like |
| 338.69 | 4.11 | 342.80 | now I"ll throw his head to the inside |
| 340.75 | 5.11 | 345.86 | now I thought when I throw his head to |
| 342.80 | 4.41 | 347.21 | the inside his inside legs down now I |
| 345.86 | 3.66 | 349.52 | can press him that way |
| 347.21 | 5.22 | 352.43 | if his head"s here I can"t pressure that |
| 349.52 | 6.15 | 355.67 | way that makes sense so I can"t pressure |
| 352.43 | 7.11 | 359.54 | this way I pop him now I can pressure |
| 355.67 | 5.64 | 361.31 | this way fall his side and wrestle it"s |
| 359.54 | 4.29 | 363.83 | all about where his head is sitting and |
| 361.31 | 6.30 | 367.61 | run in relation to his lock in his trail |
| 363.83 | 6.00 | 369.83 | link so if his head is on the same side |
| 367.61 | 4.56 | 372.17 | as this trail leg that"s not good for me |
| 369.83 | 4.53 | 374.36 | I need to throw his head to get on the |
| 372.17 | 5.37 | 377.54 | same side as his trailer boom |
| 374.36 | 5.01 | 379.37 | now he had to switch his knees now he |
| 377.54 | 6.24 | 383.78 | starts driving up with this inside leg |
| 379.37 | 7.44 | 386.81 | throw him back outside throwing using |
| 383.78 | 5.10 | 388.88 | your forearm to throw basically you just |
| 386.81 | 3.69 | 390.50 | scrape across your chest throw his head |
| 388.88 | 4.05 | 392.93 | inside horse head outside throws I |
| 390.50 | 4.41 | 394.91 | didn"t throw his head outside really |
| 392.93 | 4.35 | 397.28 | makes it difficult because this guy"s |
| 394.91 | 6.69 | 401.60 | gonna have to go nice which means switch |
| 397.28 | 6.30 | 403.58 | the switch nice which and if you if you |
| 401.60 | 4.68 | 406.28 | watch people wrestle no matter who |
| 403.58 | 5.13 | 408.71 | you"re watching if you just focus on one |
| 406.28 | 4.50 | 410.78 | leg so let"s say you watch me if you |
| 408.71 | 5.34 | 414.05 | watch me my right knee is gonna be on |
| 410.78 | 5.76 | 416.54 | the mat 90% of the time my left we will |
| 414.05 | 4.29 | 418.34 | not be on the map that much so what you |
| 416.54 | 3.18 | 419.72 | try to do same thing with Gabe his right |
| 418.34 | 2.16 | 420.50 | knee is gonna be on the mat most of time |
| 419.72 | 3.36 | 423.08 | any righty |
| 420.50 | 4.98 | 425.48 | right leg is gonna be on the map if I |
| 423.08 | 5.04 | 428.12 | can get it so that their left leg is on |
| 425.48 | 3.81 | 429.29 | the map and their right knee is up I"m |
| 428.12 | 3.30 | 431.42 | gonna feel much better about myself |
| 429.29 | 3.96 | 433.25 | because he"s not used to being there so |
| 431.42 | 4.32 | 435.74 | he shoots a double leg his right he"s on |
| 433.25 | 5.61 | 438.86 | the mat throw its head inside make him |
| 435.74 | 5.16 | 440.90 | put that down even if he stays up that |
| 438.86 | 4.44 | 443.30 | knee down he comes up off this leg he"s |
| 440.90 | 4.92 | 445.82 | not used to driving that way he"s not |
| 443.30 | 4.92 | 448.22 | used to driving that way and I can I can |
| 445.82 | 7.08 | 452.90 | wrestle in this position or I can throw |
| 448.22 | 6.08 | 454.30 | his head over to his down leg well throw |
| 452.90 | 4.10 | 457.00 | his head to that down leg so |
| 454.30 | 4.74 | 459.04 | I can beat his position okay so there"s |
| 457.00 | 5.49 | 462.49 | a couple options that you can do I can |
| 459.04 | 5.64 | 464.68 | circle out in front pop rotate my hip |
| 462.49 | 3.72 | 466.21 | back so whatever side his head is on I"m |
| 464.68 | 3.60 | 468.28 | gonna pop with the opposite side hit |
| 466.21 | 5.91 | 472.12 | take my right leg back so he shoots a |
| 468.28 | 6.21 | 474.49 | righty double 20 double I pop the right |
| 472.12 | 7.02 | 479.14 | leg come back turn it into a righty |
| 474.49 | 7.11 | 481.60 | single okay if he"s up he"s got me beat |
| 479.14 | 4.83 | 483.97 | and his but it"s heads down a little bit |
| 481.60 | 6.06 | 487.66 | and stuff his head and I"m gonna run my |
| 483.97 | 4.86 | 488.83 | feet that run my feet to that side look |
| 487.66 | 4.29 | 491.95 | for a body cradle |
| 488.83 | 5.37 | 494.20 | look for a body cradle popping that hip |
| 491.95 | 6.74 | 498.69 | snap to him look to my turf |
| 494.20 | 6.27 | 500.47 | things like that and then the final one |
| 498.69 | 4.39 | 503.08 | throwing his head |
| 500.47 | 4.95 | 505.42 | I"m meet him with my hips meet him with |
| 503.08 | 5.69 | 508.77 | us hit my windshield wiper across my |
| 505.42 | 8.34 | 513.76 | chest throw his head capture his head |
| 508.77 | 8.29 | 517.06 | stop so I windshield white bone and |
| 513.76 | 4.74 | 518.50 | inside stuff his head down and you do |
| 517.06 | 3.39 | 520.45 | those three options there"s gonna be |
| 518.50 | 3.90 | 522.40 | some times where he tries to lift you up |
| 520.45 | 4.44 | 524.89 | real strong you"re got to figure |
| 522.40 | 5.10 | 527.50 | something out so what I do can I shoot |
| 524.89 | 4.50 | 529.39 | two double-a here I can"t get him off |
| 527.50 | 5.01 | 532.51 | one side or another I"ll come to my |
| 529.39 | 5.22 | 534.61 | chest wrap once I"m in this chest wrap I |
| 532.51 | 4.26 | 536.77 | need to be able to roll through this is |
| 534.61 | 4.14 | 538.75 | freestyle this is free socks right here |
| 536.77 | 4.22 | 540.99 | he"s gonna try to lift my feet up off |
| 538.75 | 5.88 | 544.63 | the mat I need to drop my buck here |
| 540.99 | 5.89 | 546.88 | notice how I dropped my butt now he said |
| 544.63 | 6.48 | 551.11 | this is a tight position for him once |
| 546.88 | 8.01 | 554.89 | I"m here I can go chessmen throw them |
| 551.11 | 8.10 | 559.21 | through and wrestle score my four or two |
| 554.89 | 7.92 | 562.81 | depending on what the ref calls for high |
| 559.21 | 6.78 | 565.99 | amplitude so he shoot another leg I"m |
| 562.81 | 5.61 | 568.42 | gonna stop hip squat oh god now once I"m |
| 565.99 | 5.10 | 571.09 | here I got him he"s gonna be trying to |
| 568.42 | 6.51 | 574.93 | float his hips away from his head I need |
| 571.09 | 7.43 | 578.52 | to take his far hip his inside him over |
| 574.93 | 3.59 | 578.52 | top of his opposite side shoulder here |
| 578.53 | 10.99 | 589.52 | if I don"t they"ll probably call and I |
| 585.65 | 7.80 | 593.45 | try to rollin through his points all day |
| 589.52 | 5.40 | 594.92 | okay I can"t throw him I"m Way from his |
| 593.45 | 7.55 | 601.00 | head I have to throw over top of his |
| 594.92 | 8.67 | 603.59 | head once I throw over top of his head I |
| 601.00 | 6.25 | 607.25 | change the direction that"s my points |
| 603.59 | 6.30 | 609.89 | I"m gonna score so we have a few options |
| 607.25 | 5.82 | 613.07 | that will work in all styles you have a |

all right so this next position is a really tough defensive position especially because you don't have very many options when a guy shoots a double leg he has he has your legs wrapped or he has his legs locked there's gonna be a little bit different things that I'm going to try to do anytime a guy tries to shoot a double leg I'm always trying to meet his hips okay I'm always trying to meet his hips so it gets you to double-a here I'm trying to I'm trying to knock him off balance okay as I'm knocking him off balance my goal is again create namely if he only if he doesn't have his hands lock and he's like this this is great because now I can try to turn this into a single leg so I knock him with my hips and then I'm gonna turn and I'm gonna try to give him I'm gonna try to give him the angle to his backside so I'm going to turn and try to give him the angle that back side most of time guile hang on once I'm in this position I can pretty much be sure that he's not gonna double it there's two options I can push his hand down or I can pull his hand up pulling his hand up so a little risky reason that's a little risky is I pull my hand up he can just lock right under my butt cheeks and then go for a double leg takedown this way he can just run me down if I push down this way I force him to attack more play okay so he shoots a double leg I'm meeting with my hips boom and I turn the corner here now I'm gonna push that wrist off and rest on this position okay now now once I'm here we'll go back to those single leg defenses by square himself on the corner okay so when you're when someone is shooting that double leg you have to be you have to anticipate where they're going so if I if he shoots and I try to back up and he can get his hips in he's just gonna run me down okay I'm in trouble I need to get into him on this and this is one of the cases where I'm not running away I don't want to run away from a double I want to get into him and take away his anger so I'm in a good stance he goes to shoot boom get into him and take away angry right here force him into a similarly now once he the single a we can wrestle okay another option this guy shoots a double leg he brings his trail leg up I'm gonna fall see how I'm starting to fall to his lead leg I'm gonna fall to his lead leg and as I'm falling I'm looking to get to my crotch lift okay body credible I'm gonna go outside hip under the butt cheek here and as I'm here I'm gonna drive my toes into this leg five my toes into this leg and wrestle through this position okay I'm most of the time guys shirts he gets crushed up he's gonna he's gonna bail that leg out he's not gonna want to be in that position and when he does it's not here here give me the help and now I'm in a good position but it's all about running your feet he shoots I'm gonna run my feet out and around I'm not gonna try to run this way right I'll pop and twist this way to get that off but if he has a really good double a I'm gonna lean my feet are gonna chop this one feet are going to chop that way I'm trying to me I'm trying to break his his position he's trying to take me this way I don't want to go that way I want to lean over top his head so I bring my chest I put my arm over the back of his head here we get to the backside okay so one more thing with this position is this guy's getting really strong again if I can get over that far knee but better so I rotate him then I go that way so if I rotate them first and then drop off to that side my ability to score goes up if I wrote if I circle this way and then try to go look how much greater position he's I'm in trouble so I can't rotate the way he wants rotate I can't I can't go back step I need okay now again the double eggs really hard because he's got bull he's not my hips all the way locked in so what I need to think about is where am I going to put his head okay I mean there's one option take two hands push his head away he starts driving in I have to have a really good balance on my feet so go ahead and try another leg here see I pushed that head away and try to get those legs away that's my best option if he's super deep like most of the time I'm a guy soon he's gonna be trying to lift you up off the mat so if he's here he's probably gonna stand and lift just go ahead lift double a if my feet come off the ground I'm in trouble you cannot let your feet come off the ground absolutely not only if you come off the ground when he shoots you got to play them in and you got to think pressure into this guy pressure into this guy get his head away get his head away punch him in the ribs down lock in the ribs slide down to the left look for my score so you have to meet his pressure when he shoots a double eight boom shimmy-shake get that hip open now once I'm here I wrestle the single way any time you shoot a double I try to make him wrestle Singh way sometimes what will happen is I'll punch here like now I'll throw his head to the inside now I thought when I throw his head to the inside his inside legs down now I can press him that way if his head's here I can't pressure that way that makes sense so I can't pressure this way I pop him now I can pressure this way fall his side and wrestle it's all about where his head is sitting and run in relation to his lock in his trail link so if his head is on the same side as this trail leg that's not good for me I need to throw his head to get on the same side as his trailer boom now he had to switch his knees now he starts driving up with this inside leg throw him back outside throwing using your forearm to throw basically you just scrape across your chest throw his head inside horse head outside throws I didn't throw his head outside really makes it difficult because this guy's gonna have to go nice which means switch the switch nice which and if you if you watch people wrestle no matter who you're watching if you just focus on one leg so let's say you watch me if you watch me my right knee is gonna be on the mat 90% of the time my left we will not be on the map that much so what you try to do same thing with Gabe his right knee is gonna be on the mat most of time any righty right leg is gonna be on the map if I can get it so that their left leg is on the map and their right knee is up I'm gonna feel much better about myself because he's not used to being there so he shoots a double leg his right he's on the mat throw its head inside make him put that down even if he stays up that knee down he comes up off this leg he's not used to driving that way he's not used to driving that way and I can I can wrestle in this position or I can throw his head over to his down leg well throw his head to that down leg so I can beat his position okay so there's a couple options that you can do I can circle out in front pop rotate my hip back so whatever side his head is on I'm gonna pop with the opposite side hit take my right leg back so he shoots a righty double 20 double I pop the right leg come back turn it into a righty single okay if he's up he's got me beat and his but it's heads down a little bit and stuff his head and I'm gonna run my feet that run my feet to that side look for a body cradle look for a body cradle popping that hip snap to him look to my turf things like that and then the final one throwing his head I'm meet him with my hips meet him with us hit my windshield wiper across my chest throw his head capture his head stop so I windshield white bone and inside stuff his head down and you do those three options there's gonna be some times where he tries to lift you up real strong you're got to figure something out so what I do can I shoot two double-a here I can't get him off one side or another I'll come to my chest wrap once I'm in this chest wrap I need to be able to roll through this is freestyle this is free socks right here he's gonna try to lift my feet up off the mat I need to drop my buck here notice how I dropped my butt now he said this is a tight position for him once I'm here I can go chessmen throw them through and wrestle score my four or two depending on what the ref calls for high amplitude so he shoot another leg I'm gonna stop hip squat oh god now once I'm here I got him he's gonna be trying to float his hips away from his head I need to take his far hip his inside him over top of his opposite side shoulder here if I don't they'll probably call and I try to rollin through his points all day okay I can't throw him I'm Way from his head I have to throw over top of his head once I throw over top of his head I change the direction that's my points I'm gonna score so we have a few options that will work in all styles you have a chest strap that will work even in folks out if you want to throw them through if you can you just can't hit your button so on folk style he shoots at double-a and I drop here I throw up through I can't hit my button I gotta throw oh [Music] that's pretty risky in folk style but it's still an option option to get out of that I mean it's better than getting planted on your back with the double leg he lifts you up and spikes you that's no good keep your feet on the mat as long as your feet are on the mat you have a chance use your hip pressure try to get his head away from his lock switch his head inside outside make him switches knees you know be good to go
