the red Yani in the blue and Yani going to take the center of the mat immediately so [Music] weird so ball of great with elbow control fireman's carry stuff really good job at getting fours feet to back stuff sh from the outside re attack oh that's what happened with that's exactly what happened with daring ex same position he's going to pick up for early and now they're stopping him that was a weird stoppage but whatever 30 seconds in 40 Z for the Iranian and it's either I guess you got to either expose yourself like that or you end up on your back and potential to be pinned so oh big left Club from sabala it was the same M officier who called that illegal against uh malero well oh no no he was he was on the he was the chair of that match judge or chair I believe yes he was a chair he's right next to us no he was on the map he was on the map 55 into this one high pace for this one both guys there errant shot by saala and head in the hole could we see a standard o nice job by looking to peek out now he's on the single and he should just well [ __ ] right maybe he drives forward and that foot goes out of bounds was he grounded now he's going to pull him back in he's going to work to finish and we'll see the Iranians quadpod tested once more that knee touches but no no it didn't it touches his elbow tou elbows touch and the knee was on the elbow aute observation Vader and there's the [Music] two now it's 42 that four pointer that big move looming large [Music] here there's Donnie fixing his knee brace [Music] there oh nice shot by yon but good hit by the ball off and they bring it backed up defeats the ball up in the front headlock position minute 10 to go in the first referee says keep it going keep it going now he blows it dead puts him on their feet in the middle 107 singing a chant here for yzd says we love you yes we love you yes yes Donnie translating on the flly yeah yeah working on it fary football tie there for [Music] saala moving in to the final 30 seconds period number one two-point lead for yaas Don cha look at him taking ground with that under going go to the edge and he's going to take oh tight rope walk did he do it yes there's the one I want to see stats on how many push outs the Iranians get steps break break the calculators with that one there comes again again look at him driving wow that one was too easy the youngster from Iran extends his lead to forward 62 10 seconds to go in the first look at him getting to it again and just gets low and got to avoid short time does he avoid time's up time's up time's up time's up I thought they all going to confirm it when his hand went up time was up [Music] coach Tov saying yes you do want this [Music] challenge no it's still the period's over regardless so they're going to look for the time I so I think the the ruling these guys can't go to their Corners yet the period's not over I guess until the challenge is over that's all so we all get to take a look at this this is will it be black and white or will it be pretty close I don't know I thought time was up that's not is that see ah I I say time was up yeah time was up solid challenge now you can go to your Corners Russia will get the queue back but look at sabala walking over his Corner a little bit deflated yeah like this kid and they they're showing the replay game but it's over they don't they can turn that off there you go so now 62 at the break in favor of a yazdani Chira kid's good man kid's good back out to the center 3 minutes down 3 minutes to go sabal's got his work cut out he Trails by four former world champion to the defending World runner up and he finds himself on a leg look at him get that leg back yeah y Donnie solid defense here and like right before he goes out of bounds he goes to his knees and shoves that foot and drives back in and it's going to be a take down oh no nothing yet nothing yet now it's dang close but they still have not awarded anything they're pointing to that post now he hits his elbow and I'm thinking that's going to be two and deed it will yeah could he take it back he's got the legs wrapped up defensive position yet I don't know if that the back oh now are they going to yeah Donnie sitting on that's too blue I think they got to give that crafty move just by Iranian he hung there too [Music] long and trying to go for um some some extra exposure ended up hurting sabalo now what's this two red but it's two blue it's going to be confirmed it's two [Applause] blue do they throw the challenge Cube [Applause] now thought about it I would throw it if I was rushing I would throw it we're going to wait till he's in on a single maybe oh wow the ball just gives that one up and he might get get rolled up here I don't know he looks like he might be this would end it l there it is there it is Tech 144 if it's confirmed no we got a white Cube over here oh no 144 on the board and that will do it Hassan Yani chid Chate tomato tomato that's what I was going to say regardless he's your winner and maybe Russ should have tried challenging that say what nothing I thought Russ should have challenge that that back and forth and now as Dian shate takes out a world champion and Iran continuing to roll over the r
