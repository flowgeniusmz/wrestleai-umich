| 0.00 | 4.96 | 4.96 | i watch a lot of content online |
| 2.88 | 4.00 | 6.88 | and i see |
| 4.96 | 4.32 | 9.28 | basic problems with stances which is |
| 6.88 | 4.32 | 11.20 | fine because you can always correct your |
| 9.28 | 4.32 | 13.60 | stance i said this on a video i recorded |
| 11.20 | 3.84 | 15.04 | recently about i went to college |
| 13.60 | 2.88 | 16.48 | and the first thing our collegiate |
| 15.04 | 4.00 | 19.04 | wrestling coaches did was tell us to get |
| 16.48 | 4.08 | 20.56 | our stances we all got in our like funky |
| 19.04 | 3.68 | 22.72 | stances like you know that worked in |
| 20.56 | 4.72 | 25.28 | high school we were all like cool |
| 22.72 | 4.24 | 26.96 | and my coach said you guys all suck |
| 25.28 | 4.00 | 29.28 | and we were like |
| 26.96 | 4.00 | 30.96 | what and he was like get in the stance |
| 29.28 | 3.44 | 32.72 | and then we didn"t realize we had all |
| 30.96 | 3.84 | 34.80 | these problems our back foot was like |
| 32.72 | 3.52 | 36.24 | this this is a really this is actually |
| 34.80 | 3.04 | 37.84 | really common this is probably one of |
| 36.24 | 3.04 | 39.28 | the hardest habits to break and it"s |
| 37.84 | 2.64 | 40.48 | because |
| 39.28 | 2.96 | 42.24 | um |
| 40.48 | 3.76 | 44.24 | this is just easier and more natural but |
| 42.24 | 3.52 | 45.76 | a sprinter starts like this right so you |
| 44.24 | 2.56 | 46.80 | want your toes all facing forward |
| 45.76 | 3.12 | 48.88 | because this is where your power will |
| 46.80 | 3.60 | 50.40 | come from so |
| 48.88 | 3.76 | 52.64 | what i learned |
| 50.40 | 4.96 | 55.36 | uh from my collegiate wrestling coaches |
| 52.64 | 4.88 | 57.52 | was you don"t want to be so low |
| 55.36 | 4.72 | 60.08 | that it"s easy to just pull my weight |
| 57.52 | 3.92 | 61.44 | down okay and i don"t want to be so tall |
| 60.08 | 3.36 | 63.44 | that i just give it all up which is |
| 61.44 | 4.16 | 65.60 | something that happens in jiu jitsu i |
| 63.44 | 3.92 | 67.36 | understand because the throat"s there so |
| 65.60 | 3.20 | 68.80 | you want to be able to protect it so |
| 67.36 | 2.88 | 70.24 | actually the best wrestling stance and |
| 68.80 | 3.60 | 72.40 | the one that i learned in college is |
| 70.24 | 5.60 | 75.84 | somewhere in between there if you watch |
| 72.40 | 6.16 | 78.56 | any sport football baseball whatever |
| 75.84 | 5.28 | 81.12 | you see this power position here right |
| 78.56 | 5.60 | 84.16 | to catch the ball to come off the line |
| 81.12 | 3.04 | 84.16 | whatever so |
| 85.28 | 2.72 | 88.00 | if you"re comfortable here you most |
| 86.72 | 2.48 | 89.20 | people should be comfortable standing |
| 88.00 | 2.96 | 90.96 | about right here |
| 89.20 | 3.44 | 92.64 | okay |
| 90.96 | 2.96 | 93.92 | that"s when you put your hands out the |
| 92.64 | 3.44 | 96.08 | front okay because your hands are your |
| 93.92 | 4.40 | 98.32 | first line of defense then your head so |
| 96.08 | 5.36 | 101.44 | in this case if a guy shooting on me my |
| 98.32 | 4.64 | 102.96 | hands are low okay but my elbows are out |
| 101.44 | 4.80 | 106.24 | the front |
| 102.96 | 4.32 | 107.28 | okay so um there"s all the iowa guys if |
| 106.24 | 3.28 | 109.52 | you watch |
| 107.28 | 4.96 | 112.24 | are in their their classically trained |
| 109.52 | 5.04 | 114.56 | wrestlers are very good at |
| 112.24 | 4.00 | 116.24 | they continue to pull their elbows in |
| 114.56 | 3.36 | 117.92 | and they keep their arms out in front |
| 116.24 | 3.36 | 119.60 | okay like this this is the best |
| 117.92 | 4.00 | 121.92 | wrestling stance literally that you can |
| 119.60 | 3.60 | 123.20 | have it allows for the most mobility for |
| 121.92 | 2.80 | 124.72 | me to move around you can switch your |
| 123.20 | 4.08 | 127.28 | feet up if you want but you always have |
| 124.72 | 5.04 | 129.76 | to protect this lead leg okay none of |
| 127.28 | 4.96 | 132.24 | this reaching like this this is just |
| 129.76 | 3.44 | 133.20 | giving him everything okay |
| 132.24 | 2.48 | 134.72 | and |
| 133.20 | 3.52 | 136.72 | there"s very few people who could |
| 134.72 | 4.08 | 138.80 | wrestle like john smith who wrestled |
| 136.72 | 4.64 | 141.36 | really really low okay and john smith |
| 138.80 | 5.04 | 143.84 | was able but he still if you watch john |
| 141.36 | 4.64 | 146.00 | you know he still played within this |
| 143.84 | 3.60 | 147.44 | range really well and his hands were out |
| 146.00 | 3.60 | 149.60 | for fun okay |
| 147.44 | 4.24 | 151.68 | nobody"s ever been like him ever again |
| 149.60 | 3.76 | 153.36 | so for most of us mortals this is how |
| 151.68 | 3.20 | 154.88 | you have to stand okay |
| 153.36 | 3.52 | 156.88 | rest here |
| 154.88 | 4.08 | 158.96 | okay so that this puts your back in a |
| 156.88 | 4.48 | 161.36 | good position in a strong position |
| 158.96 | 4.72 | 163.68 | and the hands come out in front okay |
| 161.36 | 4.96 | 166.32 | i see plenty of people who are teaching |
| 163.68 | 4.48 | 168.16 | wrestling who aren"t wrestlers trained |
| 166.32 | 3.36 | 169.68 | their jiu jitsu guys who who are |
| 168.16 | 3.28 | 171.44 | shooting their back is straight but |
| 169.68 | 3.20 | 172.88 | their hands are like this and then |
| 171.44 | 3.84 | 175.28 | they"re shooting and their hands are |
| 172.88 | 5.04 | 177.92 | like this like anybody |
| 175.28 | 3.84 | 179.12 | that knows anything can stuff you |
| 177.92 | 2.48 | 180.40 | if their hands are out and in fact |
| 179.12 | 3.28 | 182.40 | that"s what you see if they"re up |
| 180.40 | 3.44 | 183.84 | against anybody who"s any good |
| 182.40 | 3.60 | 186.00 | they just can"t get past their hands and |
| 183.84 | 4.08 | 187.92 | they can"t figure it out because |
| 186.00 | 3.52 | 189.52 | your hands have to be out here if i want |
| 187.92 | 3.84 | 191.76 | to be able to get his hands from |
| 189.52 | 3.92 | 193.44 | dragging or posting any of those things |
| 191.76 | 3.60 | 195.36 | but you notice how i never |
| 193.44 | 3.68 | 197.12 | come up and out of a lot |
| 195.36 | 4.48 | 199.84 | okay i"m not coming up and out when i |
| 197.12 | 5.12 | 202.24 | post for example i"m staying here and |
| 199.84 | 4.32 | 204.16 | when i get on that leg i"m never coming |
| 202.24 | 4.40 | 206.64 | out of my stance when i run the double |
| 204.16 | 4.08 | 208.24 | if i"m here in the bottom position and i |
| 206.64 | 3.92 | 210.56 | come up to my feet |
| 208.24 | 3.84 | 212.08 | when i get the hands off and i turn i"m |
| 210.56 | 2.72 | 213.28 | never coming out of my position so you |
| 212.08 | 4.24 | 216.32 | need to |
| 213.28 | 5.12 | 218.40 | really work on this position |
| 216.32 | 5.04 | 221.36 | being strong here |
| 218.40 | 4.72 | 223.12 | and not coming out of it so if dumb one |
| 221.36 | 4.32 | 225.68 | drill that you can do is just grab my |
| 223.12 | 4.40 | 227.52 | head and this is really hard you can do |
| 225.68 | 4.48 | 230.16 | this for a few minutes and just try to |
| 227.52 | 3.68 | 231.20 | yank me out of my stance and just really |
| 230.16 | 2.40 | 232.56 | stay here |
| 231.20 | 2.64 | 233.84 | like this |
| 232.56 | 3.44 | 236.00 | and you"re gonna you"re gonna you know |
| 233.84 | 4.08 | 237.92 | there"s going to be times when you come |
| 236.00 | 4.48 | 240.48 | out of your stance a little bit |
| 237.92 | 4.56 | 242.48 | but the purpose is he"s really |
| 240.48 | 4.32 | 244.80 | really really strong |
| 242.48 | 4.56 | 247.04 | really strong so when he"s pulling me |
| 244.80 | 4.32 | 249.12 | around what i"m trying to |
| 247.04 | 4.96 | 252.00 | prevent myself from doing |
| 249.12 | 4.56 | 253.68 | is breaking protocol like |
| 252.00 | 3.60 | 255.60 | and trying to come up and out because oh |
| 253.68 | 4.00 | 257.68 | my back is tired or all my legs are |
| 255.60 | 3.28 | 258.88 | tired like you should be able to stay in |
| 257.68 | 3.36 | 261.04 | a stance |
| 258.88 | 4.24 | 263.12 | and move around by yourself |
| 261.04 | 3.68 | 264.72 | you know and move for |
| 263.12 | 3.52 | 266.64 | six seven minutes |
| 264.72 | 2.96 | 267.68 | seven if it"s college most you guys |
| 266.64 | 2.48 | 269.12 | probably are watching this if you"re a |
| 267.68 | 2.72 | 270.40 | collegiate wrestler |
| 269.12 | 3.12 | 272.24 | six minutes if you"re in high school and |
| 270.40 | 4.16 | 274.56 | stay here okay you should be able to |
| 272.24 | 4.08 | 276.32 | stay here your weight should be |
| 274.56 | 4.00 | 278.56 | more on your balls to your feet but not |
| 276.32 | 4.64 | 280.96 | so much that you fall over but if you"re |
| 278.56 | 5.92 | 284.48 | if your butt"s under you okay |
| 280.96 | 5.12 | 286.08 | then this is a strong positioning okay |
| 284.48 | 3.20 | 287.68 | it doesn"t have to be fancy you don"t |
| 286.08 | 3.04 | 289.12 | need something cool you know and |
| 287.68 | 2.96 | 290.64 | everybody takes their high school |
| 289.12 | 2.80 | 291.92 | wrestling photos |
| 290.64 | 4.24 | 294.88 | no |
| 291.92 | 3.84 | 295.76 | you know weird stances like |
| 294.88 | 3.12 | 298.00 | this should be your high school |
| 295.76 | 5.60 | 301.36 | wrestling photo right here |
| 298.00 | 5.44 | 303.44 | oh man it looks so 1960s well |
| 301.36 | 4.24 | 305.60 | they figured stuff out this is the best |
| 303.44 | 3.76 | 307.20 | stance you can"t get past my hands you |
| 305.60 | 3.92 | 309.52 | have to do a lot of work and then if you |
| 307.20 | 4.00 | 311.20 | do get my hands out of the way my head"s |
| 309.52 | 3.60 | 313.12 | the next line of defense |
| 311.20 | 4.16 | 315.36 | once you get here |
| 313.12 | 3.84 | 316.96 | i"m in trouble okay |
| 315.36 | 3.20 | 318.56 | and and again you don"t need to come out |
| 316.96 | 4.80 | 321.76 | of your stance if somebody gets up on my |
| 318.56 | 5.92 | 324.48 | hips i want to be able to control |
| 321.76 | 5.12 | 326.88 | it for the power position here |
| 324.48 | 4.80 | 329.28 | okay so work on that work on staying |
| 326.88 | 4.32 | 331.20 | tough stay in here this is fundamental |
| 329.28 | 5.12 | 334.40 | if you"re winning a match and somebody"s |
| 331.20 | 5.44 | 336.64 | coming at you like a honey badger you |
| 334.40 | 4.40 | 338.80 | have to be able to maintain good proper |
| 336.64 | 2.96 | 339.60 | space if you"re in good stance and |
| 338.80 | 2.24 | 341.04 | they"re |
| 339.60 | 2.32 | 341.92 | coming out of their states trying so |
| 341.04 | 2.48 | 343.52 | hard |
| 341.92 | 3.36 | 345.28 | you might get some easy shots you might |
| 343.52 | 4.72 | 348.24 | get some easy posts |
| 345.28 | 4.00 | 349.28 | okay because you"re being fundamentally |
| 348.24 | 2.56 | 350.80 | sound |
| 349.28 | 3.12 | 352.40 | if you can"t stay in your stance when |
| 350.80 | 5.12 | 355.92 | you"re tired |
| 352.40 | 6.32 | 358.72 | you need to work on that like that is |
| 355.92 | 5.28 | 361.20 | fundamental stance is number one |
| 358.72 | 4.72 | 363.44 | even when i went to d1 the first thing |
| 361.20 | 4.88 | 366.08 | they did was have us get into our stance |
| 363.44 | 4.96 | 368.40 | if you can"t do this you can"t wrestle |
| 366.08 | 5.52 | 371.60 | not at a high level okay so |
| 368.40 | 5.76 | 374.16 | because what you don"t want to do is |
| 371.60 | 5.44 | 377.04 | having people on you and so much more |
| 374.16 | 5.92 | 380.08 | work for me to get them off my legs okay |
| 377.04 | 5.44 | 382.48 | so we"re here we"re gonna stay here okay |
| 380.08 | 4.08 | 384.16 | so get used to walking around i used to |
| 382.48 | 3.12 | 385.60 | walk around my house like this |
| 384.16 | 2.16 | 386.32 | in high school |
| 385.60 | 2.96 | 388.56 | so |
| 386.32 | 4.00 | 390.32 | uh let me know what you think |

i watch a lot of content online and i see basic problems with stances which is fine because you can always correct your stance i said this on a video i recorded recently about i went to college and the first thing our collegiate wrestling coaches did was tell us to get our stances we all got in our like funky stances like you know that worked in high school we were all like cool and my coach said you guys all suck and we were like what and he was like get in the stance and then we didn't realize we had all these problems our back foot was like this this is a really this is actually really common this is probably one of the hardest habits to break and it's because um this is just easier and more natural but a sprinter starts like this right so you want your toes all facing forward because this is where your power will come from so what i learned uh from my collegiate wrestling coaches was you don't want to be so low that it's easy to just pull my weight down okay and i don't want to be so tall that i just give it all up which is something that happens in jiu jitsu i understand because the throat's there so you want to be able to protect it so actually the best wrestling stance and the one that i learned in college is somewhere in between there if you watch any sport football baseball whatever you see this power position here right to catch the ball to come off the line whatever so if you're comfortable here you most people should be comfortable standing about right here okay that's when you put your hands out the front okay because your hands are your first line of defense then your head so in this case if a guy shooting on me my hands are low okay but my elbows are out the front okay so um there's all the iowa guys if you watch are in their their classically trained wrestlers are very good at they continue to pull their elbows in and they keep their arms out in front okay like this this is the best wrestling stance literally that you can have it allows for the most mobility for me to move around you can switch your feet up if you want but you always have to protect this lead leg okay none of this reaching like this this is just giving him everything okay and there's very few people who could wrestle like john smith who wrestled really really low okay and john smith was able but he still if you watch john you know he still played within this range really well and his hands were out for fun okay nobody's ever been like him ever again so for most of us mortals this is how you have to stand okay rest here okay so that this puts your back in a good position in a strong position and the hands come out in front okay i see plenty of people who are teaching wrestling who aren't wrestlers trained their jiu jitsu guys who who are shooting their back is straight but their hands are like this and then they're shooting and their hands are like this like anybody that knows anything can stuff you if their hands are out and in fact

and just try to yank me out of my stance and just really stay here like this and you're gonna you're gonna you know there's going to be times when you come out of your stance a little bit but the purpose is he's really really really strong really strong so when he's pulling me around what i'm trying to prevent myself from doing is breaking protocol like and trying to come up and out because oh my back is tired or all my legs are tired like you should be able to stay in a stance and move around by yourself you know and move for six seven minutes seven if it's college most you guys probably are watching this if you're a collegiate wrestler six minutes if you're in high school and stay here okay you should be able to stay here your weight should be more on your balls to your feet but not so much that you fall over but if you're if your butt's under you okay then this is a strong positioning okay it doesn't have to be fancy you don't need something cool you know and everybody takes their high school wrestling photos no you know weird stances like this should be your high school wrestling photo right here oh man it looks so 1960s well they figured stuff out this is the best stance you can't get past my hands you have to do a lot of work and then if you do get my hands out of the way my head's the next line of defense once you get here i'm in trouble okay and and again you don't need to come out of your stance if somebody gets up on my hips i want to be able to control it for the power position here okay so work on that work on staying tough stay in here this is fundamental if you're winning a match and somebody's coming at you like a honey badger you have to be able to maintain good proper space if you're in good stance and they're coming out of their states trying so hard you might get some easy shots you might get some easy posts okay because you're being fundamentally sound if you can't stay in your stance when you're tired you need to work on that like that is fundamental stance is number one even when i went to d1 the first thing they did was have us get into our stance if you can't do this you can't wrestle not at a high level okay so because what you don't want to do is having people on you and so much more work for me to get them off my legs okay so we're here we're gonna stay here okay so get used to walking around i used to walk around my house like this in high school so uh let me know what you think um if you have any specific comments about like and subscribe and uh we can continue to post comments or content on this thanks
