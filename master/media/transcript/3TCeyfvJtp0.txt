great hair Mark Bader here we go 74 kg Hassan Yani Chidi in the red for Iran taking on Alex daringer for the United States Danger on a couple of knees here staying low do Donnie right in the center of you talking you're talking to him about pulling on the head what do you think he's going to do the offal put two hands on the head and P okay or lock him maybe yeah yeah maybe not there's front headlock and front headlock nice defense or at least way to escape that maneuver for daringer 47 into the first period and they're going to verbally warn daringer for passivity early in the match they tell ya don't choke so that's attention and immediately steps forward and takes control of the m is Iran I want to know and I said this yesterday what kind of drills do they do you know how what are they working on specifically what things do you do in the room to to to practice that they're all do it I'm assuming all throughout their youth they're learning that from that's the third time just Donnie's been been talked to about something different either let him wrestle or hit him or something let's let's make something happen here and to see daringer moved around Pace being dictated to him is something we haven't seen a lot with Alex we haven't seen it certainly through his college career his pace and pressure was incredible and now we're seeing as Donnie just driving just getting a little lower driving running his feet and now getting to that underhook he just down TR to shate oh he's going to take him through he's going to take four that's a big one daringer tries to go one way the other with his underhook that's one of his Paton moves and now he's on his heels a little bit going backwards not a good [Music] place a nice snap and pull by is Dan Chate and man dinger's got to get to his tie here and right now he's yeah needs to clear this collar he's wrestling where where y Donnie wants [Music] him so 40 seconds to go here in the first daringer trailing 4-0 to Y Donnie Shi be nice to get on the board at the end of this period if you're Alex daringer fire off an attack get a step out something we'll see if he pushes late here good snap there bringing dinger's hands to the mat 22 seconds to [Music] go and we move inside the final 10 seconds tough first period for Alex D one flurry ends up with four points kind of an interesting bail there by daringer feet to back in FK style that's all good and freestyle it's all bad all bad feet to back a period that was completely and totally dictated by ason Chate around the world M rice and his have been very generous their donations and their attentions wrestl getting Ace in the corner from a Guerrero his personal coach John Smith in the booth one thing that's great about daringer is he's got that feet to back ability himself from that underhook series but he's got to be able to hand fight he's got to out hand fight one of the best hand fighters in the world has D Chate one of the most popular I think he maybe is the most popular Iranian wrestler and he's young right so they got the future riding on this kid he's going to be a good one this could be somebody that that you know battles with burrow through 2020 or however long Jordan decides to go right no question and now now here we go daringer for just a moment had the position where his butt was at the center of the mat had yaani on the outside and quickly Hassan makes his way right back to the middle it's like they have a magnet for Middle yeah 30 seconds in more of the same from hanas down Chidi he's got the underhook two of them now and he's going to take danger out and there's one of those four pointers we were trying they're going to go out of bounds no points he was grounded and what you say is that confirmed it is confirmed D anger back to the middle very fortunate for daringer not giving up a point there on that exchange with yazdani double unders but able to ground himself and avoid the one underhook right side now cleared but he's he's clearing ties but he's not oh nice transition to that leg attack Don R in on that leg going to try to grap him up with some turns here oh boy going take D through out of bounds another two make it 80 and we need a point need a point Alex darer needs a point he has not really been close to getting one to this juncture 2 minutes to go Yani up by eight really smelling blood pushing daringer around the mat Alex daringer I I've never seen him this flustered obviously he's wrestling on another level in single there you go oh there it was he's got the leg he's got the leg guys Donnie sit in the corner trying to slip the shoulder need to get it in the air now sting to the corner stop right here they're both going to hang nobody wants to go anywhere it looked like daringer had a moment there he could have pounded yeah and just kind of taking a penet lap a minor pause a minor wait what yeah almost like he didn't expect himself to be in that position M oh good shot there and a whizard a wizard by daringer trying to hang on and that will do it a Donnie T your winner at 74 kg by Tech fall it will be 10 Z Iran will pick up four classification points United States
