I'm jooy with my brother Carter here we're both actually rocking in the rest boutiques these are the rest Boutique skunks these are actually releasing today on Black Friday when you guys are watching so if they're still in stock click the link in the description and get yourself a pair so trick number one this is called mirroring I first learned this uh my early days of high school and because when a guy reaches up odds are he's going to reach up too when I put my left hand out he's going to counter it with with his left hand and vice versa so basically this is just what it looks like as soon as I reach up his arms are immediately going to come up and from this I can of course react and go into my shot so a lot of the times uh especially at a start of the match or really really late in the match when you guys are lazy and tired so let's just say we shake hands start the match I boom go up as soon as his hands go up I can drw my levels as his hands go up reach drop and go in on my double leg now just I was saying later in a match to when guys are tired we're wrestling here I'm pushing them pulling them sometimes I like to collar tie bring him in put put my Force against some strength push him away and I back up a little bit shake out I come back in boom this is when I go in on my shot because when guys get lazy that's the best time to go in especially when they're tired anyone can wrestle the first period the second period but when you're going the full six s minutes into that third period That's when you break that's when you go into deep Waters that's how to get the take down using mirroring next one here for trick number two this is called the head roll I learned this one at ason wrestling Academy they do this a ton guys have had insane success with this I've been doing this for now past couple years and this is what it looks like when a guy collar ties boom I meet him with a hand automatically I go and grab this elbow here on this elbow I can control I can push it in I can pull it out and go into my shots but also what I what I've seen on Instagram too is kale Sanderson if you guys know him never lost a match in college he utilizes this a lot so when guys collar tie what he does he's grabbing this but he's rolling his head onto the other side all I'm doing is I'm replacing where his hand is to my other side of my body I'm literally replacing his hand from my left shoulder all the way to the right and from here this opens up an angle and you guys know wrestling is all about creating angles so you can see in here if I go in on a shot he's strong here he's going to back up and I can't get to that leg he's strong here shoot I can't get to that leg but what can I do is I have to break the separation and I have to get an angle so one thing is I head roll i b basically just dip my head and as I'm doing this I can Circle my feet a little bit too to make it easier on myself and as soon as I do this I have an opening from here you can push it across and go into your high SE another thing you could do is I fake and I come back out hit my single leg or what I've been kind of working on too is a head roll and I kind of going right into like a high dive kind of like more of like a Greco move so in a match setting it kind of looks like this and that is how to use the head roll this works a lot guys play around with this cuz this move Works trick number three is we got the hand drag so similar to the mirroring technique uh I've noticed this when uh I was at a keino tool Camp he showed this I know David Taylor utilizes this as well so just like mirroring if I reach up my hand he's going to reach up his hand and counter right but what I want to do is is I can reach and I already know he's going to reach so I'm going to grab his hand right from here I can grab his hand it doesn't matter how you grab it of of course all referees are different if you grab the fingers or might call you for stalling I reach up here I grab his hand now from here what I can do is I roll I can roll it out roll out the fingers and then from here I can just go right into my arm drag now another way on doing this not only if you just catch the hand but not even just the hand but you can also catch the wrist here or if I put my hand on his head his hand is going to grab it right now here's what I do I drop my hand all like this I'm circling my feet my head is going going on the inside of his bicep and I'm pressuring in and I'm picking up the leg dropping down getting my single kicking his leg and getting the taked down so once again guys it's not only if he just reaches up I can grab this and go but also I can fake him I'm using this hand on his head as a fake from here drop it Circle and I can go get the leg and take him down so in a match setting it'll look like this so that's the hand drag super simple super easy even if he doesn't grab that hand on your head at least you have distance there you can work on your fakes that's a great way to take guys down as well tip number four for wrestling techniques is something I like to call Happy Feet uh not like the 2006 movie but uh in wrestling when when you're hand fighting sometimes you get this big strong guy that's just here he's like okay I'm strong I'm here but I can't I can't get to his leg I can't reach I'm not really powerful I'm not snapping him down wrestling is your whole body it's not just your upper body it's not just your lower body but combining the two combining the Motions you can see here the same movement when I'm snapping on his head you're going to see me Circle my feet because my feet are happy they're always moving right so now when I when I when I snap in it's a lot more pressure I get his feet moving from here I can open up an angle so it's not just here banging trying to drive the bus pressuring faking but what I do is here I got to move my feet and I got to Circle my feet Circle my feet from here Circle my feet Circle my feet boom things are going to get open it's all about creating spaces creating angles and this is the best way to do it you have to pick up your feet get stuck out of the mud and get your takedown so in a real match setting it'll look something like this so there's Happy Feet guys pick your feet off the ground move your feet and score some points last but not least with trick number five this is something I like to call the pause fake I first learned about this last year and I did it in my first match this past weekend at the Finley open so this is one if I go on a fake like I'm shooting but I'm literally just going to stop I'm literally just going to stop my motion and a lot of times too this works if you're hitting the head but the what you like come back up so when I usually fake it looks something like this I'm like faking I'm going in I'm faking I'm coming back out what happens when I fake but I stay put do you see how he's already standing up he didn't even I didn't even tell him to stand up so what you can do is by faking and staying low when a guy stands up that's when he go shoot so I'm faking here I'm faking oh he stands up going onto my shot taking him down now in my match actually though too I was just wrestling and I basically just St this was I I had to get the major right and I know I needed to create action he was kind of wrestling defensively so I wanted him to make a mistake so so what I did in that match is I was just wrestling and then I just stopped and then I waited for him to react I literally just froze and he was like circling and then he took a bad sh shot and when he takes a bad shot here I can just defend right because I'm still aware even though it looks like I'm lazy doing something stupid playing mind games especially late in the match that's what I use to get that taked down and to get that major that pause fake resting here I can use some fakes some fakes when I fake Paw boom take him down that's the Paw fake so guys go try out these five tricks uh they all work they all work for me I wouldn't be saying if they wouldn't otherwise if you guys do want to learn more wrestling one program that I've used is actually the peer wrestling online Training Academy this has been super beneficial to wrestlers all across the country and by using Code Caden you guys can stay 50% off so it's a great way to support me great way to get better at wrestling that's in the description below as well that was sick but actually we have one more challenge I'm going to challenge Carter to a best of three takedown match but before we go into this match with my brother have you guys ever struggled with clothes that just do not fit just don't feel right at all jeans that fit your quads too tight that's why I'm excited to tell you guys

tutorials and i'm not even talking about on youtube i'm talking about just in most martial arts schools everybody wants to learn how to be like a wrestler they want to learn the double legs of a wrestler but it's taught so fast it's taught too fast and you're not learning the fundamentals the most basic drill in order to start learning from scratch instead they skip you ahead you skip kindergarten and you go right to the third grade and it really helps to be in kindergarten it really does okay so check this out um what we're going to do go ahead and face each other at first okay so what we want to do is we want to have one wrestler square and he's going to do what we call scarecrow because we're talking about people who don't know much he wants to have a slight good bend in the knees not not showing you super low that's too low okay we need something comfortable and easy okay we want the attack wrestler to have a right leg lead okay if he's right most people are right-handed so we're going to get a right leg lead he's going to measure his opponent go two hands on the shoulders okay and then at this point he's already got his right leg lead which means he has a back leg to drive off of you should not be too wide so if his leg was back more this is too wide if he's too wide he won't be able to take a step he won't be able to take a step and we need to be able to take a step with our front foot so our feet should be closer together not too close not too wide okay perfect what he's going to do is he's going to release the shoulders this is his measuring stick he measures with his hands touching the shoulders he's gonna release pull the elbows in and level change okay now the next moment is the crucial step this is step one level change step two he's going to take a step now he's a little far away i would rather have you a little closer we want to step three in a row at least toe to toe show me toe to toe or three in a row three in a row yeah you notice he's getting a little wide now let's restart again okay hands on the shoulders notice he's comfortable close enough level change elbows come in three in a row now when he penetrates the beginner is going to put their back leg down do not do not knee goes over toe the front leg as he pushes his opponent back the head is up the back is straight the trail leg comes up okay now let's follow around here with the camera okay the head is up notice the hands now you're going to get some different preferences hands are wrapped around the hamstrings they could go behind the knees okay they could stay up here i mean it's it's kind of it's all optional there's people who like different stuff now what we want to do is we want to turn a little bit and do what's called a swisher step which is over here and we're going to bring that right foot in this direction just pivot just pivot as he does that this leg also is moving to the side this one around the corner yep and he takes a nice deep elbow deep grip okay now once you get that step you have what's called an angle and we're teaching the wrestler or the competitor the grappler to get a good angle head is up he's going to push off of the drive leg was the trail leg now it's the drive leg and let's notice over here come around here the right leg now is going to take a step so he's going to push off and take a step at that point this toe should be pointing roughly perpendicular to his opponent the ears on the back so let's come around the back side i'd like you to collect that elbow deep nice and now he's brought the leg up almost like he's putting it on top of the shelf they're in a good balanced form position and then he's going to shuffle his feet and sweep out the opponent taking him straight to his back okay if we can our opponent in wrestling is gonna go to their belly so hands on the shoulders let's go a little quicker doubles in level change take a step down to the knee switch your step elbow goes deep finish go ahead let's do it again so as we take that step that last step and we drive up to our feet i'm just calling finish now which these boys have done tons of drills of shuffling the feet and taking down their opponent so keep that in mind all right ready level change take a step down to the move trailer comes up swisher and take a step and finish i'd like to see i want you to get this swisher step you're going to turn okay turn elbow deep step up one more here we go level change take a step down to the knee trailer comes up swisher and finish nice now this has got to be taught like over and over from the basics and that's what we're going to do now watch boys thank you thank you boys come on over come on line up spread out side by side boys side by side shoulder guys come on here here come on boys let's go okay focus you're following me stance squared stance we're gonna change the stagger right leg lean you got it level change so if our hands are on the shoulders level change elbows come in take a step down to the knee grabbing around their legs trail leg comes up swish sure we're gonna we're gonna turn our hip and grab super deep if we can with our left elbow ready we're going to go to the finished position we're kind of turning the steering wheel so we turn that steering wheel and take the step now we're not going to take it to the mat because we don't have a partner we're just going to get right back in our stance here we go let's go stagger hands on the shoulders level change take a step down to the knee trailer comes up swisher finish back in your stance one more i'm going to do it so you can see get over here kane get over here ready hands on the shoulders level change take a step down to the knee trailer comes up swisher elbow deep fence you show me okay get in line everybody side by side came two steps forward now two steps forward get your stance staggered right leg lead hands on the shoulders level change take a step down to the knee down to the knee trail light comes up swisher just turn the corner a little bit throw that left elbow deep around their leg yeah finish good back in your stance okay stagger hands on the shoulders level change take a step down to the knee trelli comes up swishing elbow deep finish nice give me one more just like that stance hands on the shoulders level change take a step down to the knee trailer comes up swisher finish it's a little tall pond jimmy little tough he wants to hurry you guys run them back and line up again so you notice these kids they've done this before but they want to rush through it don't you're in kindergarten stay in kindergarten for a while you'll be ready for the third grade later okay so check it out stamps i want you guys to be as fluid as you can don't go super fast but go where you can get all the steps and not be a robot okay no robots ready a little closer and shoot stance shoot this is what it looks like in the beginning ready shoot and shoot one more stance shoot okay good job boys alex lucas come on back okay thank you guys go ahead and hang out right here hang out i'll prep them one time let's see if they can follow it you guys ready hands on the shoulders level change take a step down to the knee trelli comes up swisher elbow deep finish all right now go through all of that without being a robot just go fluid at your own pace and shoot ready shoot ready shoot all right head on back head on back now let's add some speed ready guys speed just go in fire ready go go ready go ready go [Music] all right okay guys so that's the form that's the form that you're missing you've got to repeat that form on your own so you guys that don't have training partners all the time but you do have a mat and you can drill this is how you drill the double egg this is the part that's missing most people just get a partner and they just fire double eggs on each other without doing the form this is it this is it may not be identical at every wrestling program but it's very very close to this okay all right guys outstanding job i want three no no excuse me i just want two double eggs each do with a partner right now get up do it with a partner now the same drill though you got to do the same steps hands on the shoulders ready ready hands over the shoulders spread out your teeth bend your knees good level change shoot all right you kind of went back to a high crotch let's go partners turn ready hands on the shoulders okay level change shoot nice let's get back up switch again switch again ready hands on the shoulders level change shoot you see how we could get a little injury make sure you guys are apart ready hit set and level change shoot nice squisher i like that focusing on the steps beautiful okay guys that's it for today again i want you guys to go out there practice this drill if you're a wrestler you already know this stuff but so many people out there millions of people across the world want to learn wrestling and they don't have wrestling you're either if you're outside the united states or you're not from dagestan or iran then wrestling may not be a very popular sport in your country this is what we do this is basically what everyone does that's in wrestling okay good job boys bring it in proud of you guys and we're getting better and then this guys you do that drill that's how you're going to end up like the older kids okay and someday wrestling in college okay good job maybe even at the world level someday how about that all right tell everybody like share subscribe and we'll see

we're gonna go over is how you set up how's your stance when you go out and shake hands what are you doing how what are you thinking about how are you gonna put yourself in a position to score how you gonna put yourself in a position to limit his his attacks most of the time when I talk about stance it's really about your your elevation so how how high are you at relative to your opponent so a lot of times you'll see guys and they'll have the exact same stance every time exact same stance every time and they won't make any adjustments really they'll just be trying to go forward just be trying to put a backward and they will they won't feel let themselves flow side to side they won't let themselves change elevation and what happens a lot of times that they get stuck in one tiny little tiny little area when there's this huge space to wrestling and I always caught like a jumping-off point so the first thing I'm thinking about is I'm gonna make sure that I'm not happening slower than he is my eyes are just a little bit lower than his are so that I know that he's gonna have to make a dramatic level change and go through my entire field of vision before he can attack so the first thing I do I'm a right leg lead so when I'm in my stance 8-bits in his stance my goal is just to be a little bit lower than his now it doesn't happen always but for the most part when you wrestle guy in your weight class you're probably gonna be able to do this and a lot of times you'll see this guys will come in like oh my eyes are lower than his but now I'm straight like it and that could be a big problem because when you go straight legged like you your ability to move side to side and defend greatly diminishes so when you're in your stance you want to have your button down and a good knee bend so when you have when I talk about being in my stance it's not just about having oh my butts really load up under here well right now I have no power so you don't want to go through too many extremes when you're in your stance and another really important part is how my back is set up you'll see some guys hunched over like this and wrestling in their states like this the reason that's a problem is you don't you don't recruit the muscles on the back side of your body so if you're if you're wrestling like this and you're hunched over you're using all the front side of your muscles so using your quadrant ativy is using basically your anterior chain is what we call it so what you have to do if you go as soon as you go flat back right here now my hamstrings are engaged my Catherines engaged and now I can create more pallet and and my ability to move in my stance becomes you know just goes through the roof so that's the first part of of what I want to talk about is just holding a good stance now we got the legs what am I going to do with my arms a lot of times when we're not stance and our partners in our stance so we shake hands and then the first thing you'll see is guys just attack the head they'll lunge at the head well when you if you see what happens to my weight distribution when I'm when I'm in my stance in I launch to Gabe's head all my weight is leaning forward if he takes a small step back chops my arms or level changes goes post there's a lot of different things that can happen because you want you got so anxious to go touch it so what we call it and and what I do is I just call it a head lead so the first point of contact is always my head so anytime whereas on the contact I'll keep in my stance I'll move in my stance heads first arms are relaxed ready to down block ready to stop his first attack so when I'm when I'm wrestling my goal is always to work down and up so rarely are you gonna see me breech up here to his head most of the time it'll be down low I'll be looking at grab wrist and then I'm climbing and putting him in a position that I that I want to be okay so by doing that you eliminate some of the possibilities that he has well if I grab someone's wrist if someone grabs my wrist there's a few things I can do I can go drag I can fight the thumb go single leg attack blow but if if someone's if someone's staying low and going for my wrist rarely am I gonna try to reach up because if I go to grab and Gabe comes to grab my wrist and I do this what's exposed though or if I do this if I do this he has an opportunity to get to my lips so that's why I need to be disciplined and where I keep my hands relaxed my arms relaxed there and be intelligent with where I'm gonna grab this guy at the start so again good position knees are bent bus down back is flat head is up I'm trying to trap his hips okay not looking at his eyes and I'm looking at his feet I'm trying to look at his hips so that my peripheral vision can watch my his head goes and watch where his feet goes first thing we do head contact now there's gonna be some times where you do reach up to grab the head or pop the head I'll pop the head just and head in the pocket or I'll go caller tied to try to get here so I have an angle on this guy and most of time when we talk about angles it's tiny tiny little angles it's not like I'm jumping all the way over here to get an angle on him it's most the time it's just one small sidestep now if I only got off his centerline like 10 degrees maybe but that's enough to get him to react if I'm here it is probably going to move his feet and circle the other way so just by holding good position you can dictate where the match is gonna go you can dictate and you have to understand what you're doing a lot of times guys will come in and they'll try to wrestle and I'll be like oh I'm just gonna go out and hit my wrestler's well there's a lot deeper than that at the start you have to have a plan and that plan only comes from your practice hours leading up to the event you're not just going to all of a sudden go out and do it and then have a really good understanding of what you're trying to do a lot of times when you see guys drilling it'll be you know they'll come in the walk-in put their hands up and then they'll go into their drill well that's okay you're trying to get the reps in but that there's no purpose behind that when I drill I'm I start about about five six feet away from them I stay in my stance and I get into am here then I'm going to attack if that makes sense so you have to be very disciplined with your stance in all the minutes that you're not touching it so practice practice in you know when you when you're doing your high crotch single leg double leg anything like that most of the time you're not touching your partner you you know there's this free space here and that's that's the space you need to concentrate on when you start out you know or even when you when you're older and college level senior level you have to focus on the space that you're not touching it because if you can stay discipline there you limit his options so back in our good stance on the right leg leave knees bent I'm engaged my hamstrings because now my back is flat I'm looking at his hips and the first contact I'm gonna make is with my head now the first contact I make with is with my head is so that I can download so if my head is here I can feel Gabe doing a level change if Gabe goes level change I could I can react and go down with him where I anticipate and match his level so if it does happen where a guy gets past my head now I have my arms free so the lines of defense head hands hips then you go crazy so if Gabe shoots on me it gets past my head my hands are here to basically knock him off balance or just the stuff at shot he shoots here my hands are there now I can get my legs back now once I'm in this position I can go to school now let's say game is is really good he shoots you gets past my head in my hands well right here a lot of times guys were like well I got the map to kick out I'm at the bone to funk or I'm just gonna get taken down you got to blast them with your hips now it's where your hips come in hit them with your hips push them down now I start working to get my hips down away legs down and away away from them so that's like the basics of your lines of defense you got your head your hands and then you got your hips and then after that you can go crazy when I say go crazy I mean you do all the funk you want to do you can go into crotchless chest wraps all sorts of different things depending on the style that you wrestle so just by holding a good stance and good position you make it so that you dictate the pace and you show this guy where you're gonna do if I'm if I'm a lefty he's thinking and he's a righty he's think he's gonna attack my lead leg he's probably gonna shoot a sweet single or a low single probably gonna try to attack this way when you wrestle somebody that's a lefty ma your offense is going to change because the right legs further back you're gonna have to either take a deeper hi crotch or you're gonna have to attack the front leg so if he's a and if I'm a righty he's probably not gonna try to attack this back leg unless you can square me up and then attack why because I'm a right leg lead I know that he's probably 75% of time he's coming for this leg and because of that I can prepare myself I can prepare and be ready for this guy to attack so I keep my hand my hands a good position and then when he comes I can't anticipate that and defend his shop

'knees you know be good to go', 'start': 649.73, 'duration': 3.41}]",all right so this next position is a really tough defensive position especially because you don't have very many options when a guy shoots a double leg he has he has your legs wrapped or he has his legs locked there's gonna be a little bit different things that I'm going to try to do anytime a guy tries to shoot a double leg I'm always trying to meet his hips okay I'm always trying to meet his hips so it gets you to double-a here I'm trying to I'm trying to knock him off balance okay as I'm knocking him off balance my goal is again create namely if he only if he doesn't have his hands lock and he's like this this is great because now I can try to turn this into a single leg so I knock him with my hips and then I'm gonna turn and I'm gonna try to give him I'm gonna try to give him the angle to his backside so I'm going to turn and try to give him the angle that back side most of time guile hang on once I'm in this position I can pretty much be sure that he's not gonna double it there's two options I can push his hand down or I can pull his hand up pulling his hand up so a little risky reason that's a little risky is I pull my hand up he can just lock right under my butt cheeks and then go for a double leg takedown this way he can just run me down if I push down this way I force him to attack more play okay so he shoots a double leg I'm meeting with my hips boom and I turn the corner here now I'm gonna push that wrist off and rest on this position okay now now once I'm here we'll go back to those single leg defenses by square himself on the corner okay so when you're when someone is shooting that double leg you have to be you have to anticipate where they're going so if I if he shoots and I try to back up and he can get his hips in he's just gonna run me down okay I'm in trouble I need to get into him on this and this is one of the cases where I'm not running away I don't want to run away from a double I want to get into him and take away his anger so I'm in a good stance he goes to shoot boom get into him and take away angry right here force him into a similarly now once he the single a we can wrestle okay another option this guy shoots a double leg he brings his trail leg up I'm gonna fall see how I'm starting to fall to his lead leg I'm gonna fall to his lead leg and as I'm falling I'm looking to get to my crotch lift okay body credible I'm gonna go outside hip under the butt cheek here and as I'm here I'm gonna drive my toes into this leg five my toes into this leg and wrestle through this position okay I'm most of the time guys shirts he gets crushed up he's gonna he's gonna bail that leg out he's not gonna want to be in that position and when he does it's not here here give me the help and now I'm in a good position but it's all about running your feet he shoots I'm gonna run my feet out and around I'm not gonna try to run this way right I'll pop and twist this way to get that off but if he has a really good double a I'm gonna lean my feet are gonna chop this one feet are going to chop that way I'm trying to me I'm trying to break his his position he's trying to take me this way I don't want to go that way I want to lean over top his head so I bring my chest I put my arm over the back of his head here we get to the backside okay so one more thing with this position is this guy's getting really strong again if I can get over that far knee but better so I rotate him then I go that way so if I rotate them first and then drop off to that side my ability to score goes up if I wrote if I circle this way and then try to go look how much greater position he's I'm in trouble so I can't rotate the way he wants rotate I can't I can't go back step I need okay now again the double eggs really hard because he's got bull he's not my hips all the way locked in so what I need to think about is where am I going to put his head okay I mean there's one option take two hands push his head away he starts driving in I have to have a really good balance on my feet so go ahead and try another leg here see I pushed that head away and try to get those legs away that's my best option if he's super deep like most of the time I'm a guy soon he's gonna be trying to lift you up off the mat so if he's here he's probably gonna stand and lift just go ahead lift double a if my feet come off the ground I'm in trouble you cannot let your feet come off the ground absolutely not only if you come off the ground when he shoots you got to play them in and you got to think pressure into this guy pressure into this guy get his head away get his head away punch him in the ribs down lock in the ribs slide down to the left look for my score so you have to meet his pressure when he shoots a double eight boom shimmy-shake get that hip open now once I'm here I wrestle the single way any time you shoot a double I try to make him wrestle Singh way sometimes what will happen is I'll punch here like now I'll throw his head to the inside now I thought when I throw his head to the inside his inside legs down now I can press him that way if his head's here I can't pressure that way that makes sense so I can't pressure this way I pop him now I can pressure this way fall his side and wrestle it's all about where his head is sitting and run in relation to his lock in his trail link so if his head is on the same side as this trail leg that's not good for me I need to throw his head to get on the same side as his trailer boom now he had to switch his knees now he starts driving up with this inside leg throw him back outside throwing using your forearm to throw basically you just scrape across your chest throw his head inside horse head outside throws I didn't throw his head outside really makes it difficult because this guy's gonna have to go nice which means switch the switch nice which and if you if you watch people wrestle no matter who you're watching if you just focus on one leg so let's say you watch me if you watch me my right knee is gonna be on the mat 90% of the time my left we will not be on the map that much so what you try to do same thing with Gabe his right knee is gonna be on the mat most of time any righty right leg is gonna be on the map if I can get it so that their left leg is on the map and their right knee is up I'm gonna feel much better about myself because he's not used to being there so he shoots a double leg his right he's on the mat throw its head inside make him put that down even if he stays up that knee down he comes up off this leg he's not used to driving that way he's not used to driving that way and I can I can wrestle in this position or I can throw his head over to his down leg well throw his head to that down leg so I can beat his position okay so there's a couple options that you can do I can circle out in front pop rotate my hip back so whatever side his head is on I'm gonna pop with the opposite side hit take my right leg back so he shoots a righty double 20 double I pop the right leg come back turn it into a righty single okay if he's up he's got me beat and his but it's heads down a little bit and stuff his head and I'm gonna run my feet that run my feet to that side look for a body cradle look for a body cradle popping that hip snap to him look to my turf things like that and then the final one throwing his head I'm meet him with my hips meet him with us hit my windshield wiper across my chest throw his head capture his head stop so I windshield white bone and inside stuff his head down and you do those three options there's gonna be some times where he tries to lift you up real strong you're got to figure something out so what I do can I shoot two double-a here I can't get him off one side or another I'll come to my chest wrap once I'm in this chest wrap I need to be able to roll through this is freestyle this is free socks right here he's gonna try to lift my feet up off the mat I need to drop my buck here notice how I dropped my butt now he said this is a tight position for him once I'm here I can go chessmen throw them through and wrestle score my four or two depending on what the ref calls for high amplitude so he shoot another leg I'm gonna stop hip squat oh god now once I'm here I got him he's gonna be trying to float his hips away from his head I need to take his far hip his inside him over top of his opposite side shoulder here if I don't they'll probably call and I try to rollin through his points all day okay I can't throw him I'm Way from his head I have to throw over top of his head once I throw over top of his head I change the direction that's my points I'm gonna score so we have a few options that will work in all styles you have a chest strap that will work even in folks out if you want to throw them through if you can you just can't hit your button so on folk style he shoots at double-a and I drop here I throw up through I can't hit my button I gotta throw oh [Music] that's pretty risky in folk style but it's still an option option to get out of that I mean it's better than getting planted on your back with the double leg he lifts you up and spikes you that's no good keep your feet on the mat as long as your feet are on the mat you have a chance use your hip pressure try to get his head away from his lock switch his head inside outside make him switches knees you know be good to go

gonna go over half ring over bar and wrist and then we're gonna put a whole series together you know put it all together also we're gonna go a cradle series small easy fundamental pushing shoulder up cradle the defendant cradle what we do next so first one we're gonna go over there's gonna be on top we're gonna go to break him down we have to go tight waist right here we're gonna chop and drive them forward good and our goal is once we chop him down we have to put all our weight we're on our toes and we're driving into them to keep them flat a lot we don't want to do this come back up is when we chop him down all the way down is that we keep our knees up here and we release pressure this guy's gonna build the base yep so what we want to do this is so important as we chop him down push that into him good and we keep waiting the first thing where I look for us is a half when I bring our half here now here's what's really really important and I'm walking him through this as well is that we use our pinky first here we come here and then we run around all right one more time chop him down he brings his hands out so you spent a lot of weight it's hard for me get out bring that hand up pinky half now on this side we're gonna keep it just go straight over basic half we're gonna kick them over one big thing good we're on our toes we're lifting his head up it was all the time go ahead chopping down punch the hand through pinky here drive off all right when we get to this positions it's really important that we punched down blood punch his head and then we have to realign our chest we got to drop it back and then push them over right here on our toes looking at the ceiling good okay now I want you to do a video as you can run the half and the wrist so here's another way of using isolating both sides chop across forward okay once you got that we set our hips you take them straight down and over I get a warrant our last one here alright so that's a half series there the next thing I want him to work on is a bit uh something very common it's a bar also known as a chicken wing and a wrist so chop them down good grab the bar it's important that you grab some bar here you're gonna punch that hang in grab the wrist now here's the difference between what what I want him to do is I want to make sure that his elbow is on this on your chest there you go run it take it all the way over and come around again chop him down grab the bar there we go run it run it run it bring his shoulder to his ears as you take them all the way over you

about motion now your motion is also very personal too so keep in mind that we're we're talking to audits of your starting program you're just training one of your athletes make sure that you take into account their personality their athletic ability right because one of the worst things that you can do is bestow stance or emotion upon someone that really doesn't fit right so there's no way we can take Tom brands and put them in John Smith's stance there's no way that we could take a Kyle Schneider and put them in Jordan Oliver Stan's it just it wouldn't work not just because of body type but also because of personality right so what I want you to do is think about your motion and what you want to accomplish all right let's get into a square stance here first okay squirt let's face it okay so what you're gonna do this is the best way to circle an approach okay so let's circle first so he's going to go right left right left okay the feet never go closer than hip-width and never go further than shoulder width so that leaves us with short choppy little steps like this you would slide the head back to Mission good and come back that's perfect now what what you hear a lot of coaches saying never cross your feet never cross your feet and that is a good rule of thumb truth be told rules are very much going to be broken so as you get a more success in the sport you're gonna see guys that kind of take their time and cross their feet up a little bit but yeah for the most part you don't want your guys crossing their feet particularly in this square stance so if you cross his feet in a square stance that's a very easy turning right I wouldn't take a whole lot to knock him over however if he had a hard left he stands right language okay now if he crosses his feet just a little bit he's still pretty mobile and he can still kind of defend okay now if you are getting that square stance please okay if you are not the most athletic guy in the world okay making contact with a square stance is usually best so if you're facing me okay I'm going to square stance the way that I make contact okay it's very very safe and very very calculated right so I'll kind of almost like a third baseman coming in on but I'll keep my hands down until my head makes contact and his hands the lobby now I can use my hands okay so I'm approaching with my hands down so that he can't attack my legs and I'm making contact with my head first okay that's our stocking or pursuing motion right now if you want to kind of retreat understand something that you're still in a good sweared stance to retreats up he's coming at me I can kind of keep my hands down and able to block with my head okay your motion in a staggered stance becomes extremely important as well like I said you can theoretically cross your feet up a little bit more in your staggered stance tucking a staggered stance okay his hands are still out in front of them right but now he has the ability to go left right and forth so now the forward becomes extremely important one of these you find in a square stance is I can generate a lot of power with my back leg right so some of the best in the world can do this with both legs but if you're just starting out you're just training brandy wrestles you want to explain to them that most of their power is going to come from their back legs so when we use our motion in our stance we have to make sure that we load up our leg right so it's not just here okay I'll move I'm stepping so that I load my back leg right so I'm not stepping back here where I don't get much much push I'm setting it up here so I can drive often so keep that MOT so now I'm getting that squares in look at motion side side good now switch to a staggered stance please good let's get motion

feel is extremely important in our sport is hip-hop okay what I see far too often especially at a youth level there's one kids turn their hips over they occupy far too much space and that could be problematic if you're trying to hold someone down let's say for instance this part of the body is not just my hand but let's say this is a whole lot right the strongest is usually the middle body if I'm trying to hold him down I would like to hold down his hips if I hit post or turn and I start to occupy too much space and I go either too far towards his head or too far towards his feet now of a sudden I take all that pressure off the middle of his body okay so I'm gonna give you a couple of ways to build the skill of hip pressing what it generally is let's see so I'm gonna sit and I don't know if you guys can tell but my feet are perfectly straddling this line in the mat what I want is to not occupy more space than just this so we'll start on my butt okay our heels dance than that one foot is going to go under one foot is going to go over and again I don't want to roll I don't want to start rolling this way okay I'll leave this line I want to stay on this line the entire time so we're here just come up one foot goes under one foot goes over okay yeah knock you pipe just about the same amount of space again I'm here my hips come up and I can hear Pais and I wind up in the exact same spot now what we're gonna do next is justice sitting US law he's gonna do it by himself that's it yeah all the way down okay and now he's going to create some pressure against the wall and he's going to hit my and look freezer thick but you notice is he created space away from the wall okay and that's important especially a folk style because you can turn and get away right but also he didn't occupy much space laterally right what happens is especially please okay if he just turns here it's a whole lot easier for me to kind of circle up behind him right would it be creates pressure and hip heists out now all of a sudden he's not just further away from me but he's his hips are also 180 degrees away from you so and I'm here to collect his hips I got a long way to go right so again he creates a little bit back pressure and hip I see he's strong okay now whoa couple different ways that you can start to build this skill is again against the wall that's it that's longer this time we're going to get a butt up a little bit higher okay good I'm almost worried like a backwards I can work for are backwards we're gonna hit America good do it one more time please good if you start getting guys that become a little bit flat from this position maybe we start them okay with one foot up it kinda it trains them to know which one goes over which one go is fine for some huh we'll get to here and I'll say okay one foot up and they can occupy the same amount of space now as you start getting better obviously they want to do a platform and the further you go down the more difficult it becomes let's try and get our head a little bit yeah when you start getting really good at stand up now you can go into a back arch and I'm gonna hold your head okay yeah I'm gonna say one two three I'm gonna let go okay Joe's gonna hit - ready block two three zero can't believe it first date no he's pretty getting this game okay but we're gonna make it dimple let's do it again only this time I'm not gonna tell him one duh okay so I'm gonna get set but I'm not just gonna drop a dude right but I'm gonna get set and I'm gonna let go and he's gonna have to feel when the hip okay now again the lower you get the harder it becomes okay this is pretty darn low you think you

okay or Brazilian Jujitsu guys or anyone else okay here it is next one is super cool super awesome this is when you make the highlight reel here's what it looks like you guys all know most of you know an arm throw but what it is is just a regular round throw okay this is gonna be a reverse arm throw from two-in-one super cool they don't expect it again just like most of our moves they don't expect it and that's what makes those moves so awesome and that's what makes them work so well but here it is with people two on one ok and then he's fighting here is he's grabbing my elbow he's pulling me it doesn't really matter if it has my elbow or not but this is more difficult to do so I'm just gonna go ahead and show you how to do from here as soon as he gets my elbow start pulling me what I want to do is switch my lock down here from this lock right here I switch I rotate and I go on top so it's a reverse lock ok rotate and go on top here now what I do is I click on this foot Hemi because I'm gonna pull his whole body behind me right here see I want to get him behind me okay where he's stepping behind me loaded up and oh I'm gonna do here this extremely quickly level chance drop my level and load them up on top pull them change now once you get to this point notice the key deep the details here I'm down on this knee on the front leg goes down to one knee this are pinches type this one pinches right here and my neck is gonna pinch ok so his arm is right across my neck right here between my shoulder and my arm and I'm gonna pinch everything the way this works now is I take everything down and when I take everything down I help myself by pushing forward off of this leg and I'm going to drive forward right here to throw them in front of me she's what it looks like a little bit quicker repeal he grabs it I rotate pull behind me switch and throw whew one more time a little bit different angle sorry I get excited so I got to do the final no noise at the end very okay here this again we peel we put we rotate the wrist here rotate the wrist pull him behind me flinch and throw for four points every time and that's how you make the highlight reel my friends

change as far as how you're setting yourself up okay something important before you do a regular penetration step now you're in your stance right here near wrestling stance however you like to stand square dance I like a little bit of staggered stance it definitely sends him about more for a penetration step we're square stance may set you up later for a lunge step but we're gonna get into that later right now before you take any shot one of the most important things that you can remember is you have to change your levels you have to shoot some kind of a standing up straight position you have to change your levels and what I mean by that is I'm here and I'm literally going to change my level slower so now I'm lower than my partner's Center gravity to my opponent center of gravity and that's what I have to do before I think my penetration step soften my time come to my stance change my levels now look where I am almost in that same exact position romo my knees correct basically exactly where we were from the game once I changed my levels that's where I'm at now I gotta remember my front knees gonna hit first it's slide okay in your warm-ups this is something you can also view and I like to go back and forth just because it kind of gives me a place to do it but I'm in my stance changing my levels I'm imagining that I'm shooting through here just a straight penetration step for now here to change my levels front knee it's gonna hit first full penetration step one more time it's on your front I'm here at my stance right everything's good I'm changing levels and I'm a penetrate that's gonna be the normal penetration step what I like to do is go back and forth a few times and switching legs so just in your stance look nice and easy if you're not comfortable with it you have to slow it down slow it down really focus on levels you have to just to get that a little bit with your feet first then once you become a little bit more comfortable you guys could start levels training coming up Cheney levels benefiting whether you like to shoot with one leg or two legs meaning you could shoot from here or here I want you to drill it both ways to get your body moved up parrot loosen used to move in that way alright give that a shot

on one what I'm going to do is just show you guys my favorite setup from here there's a lot of different techniques you can do with the two on one but again in this fundamentals DVD I want you guys have the basics down first before you guys move on to a little bit more advanced stuff but you have to understand what a two-on-one is and just kind of understand the basic concepts of it so my favorite take down from that outside to on what is a series of take up I should say is using the lunch step that we just learned and going from there into our double a our high crotch are single a finish from the double leg lunge step but I'm gonna do it with a set up from a to R so what I do another important thing about getting this tone when it's first contact right supporting here family it's gonna be hard but whistle blows like get first contact given with two on one right away what I noticed a lot for my two and one is a if they don't react at all I have a lot of little easy options right come to his legs go behind him he knows that as a good opponent he's not gonna want to be there so a lot of times what they'll do is they'll try to create space by pushing on your head so when he toes have pushed off the head it opens me up perfectly for my lunch step so I want to make sure I keep control of his arm even if he's pushing on my head now I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pop his elbow and change my direction so for my level sorry just into that lunge step right basic one step so you can see here I didn't really exaggerate stepping far enough which is okay but could I have him control but I wanted to even exaggerate more at lunch step so as I pop his arm now look at I stepped a little bit farther I'm keeping his arm if I can it's bent over me all I'm gonna do is a couple my finishes cake first finish here just once I beat this arm keep my head in it I'm just gonna come up and go behind like the death under I'm behind it very very simple very effective so do defender one more time creating the opening on that side if you keep control that arm like he wants to fall over you which is really good for you second move from this two-on-one is I'm going to turn it into my double eight so I pop now my hand that's controlling his arm same thing like we did earlier the one step I'm just dropping into his knee taking this one it's driving my health penetration step and finish okay yeah boom take me money l penetration step down finish don't worry hey op shake another option is he pushes on my head lunge step now earlier with the high crotch I switch to a single eight but here I'm just gonna take my outside arm and I'm gonna rotate as I pivot to the inside of his leg pick him up look at where we are in that same position to do the corkscrew finish make sure that when you get into that one's a really effective easy one we don't have to use a lot of explosion explosiveness two on one pushes on my head lunge step right this hand back here now instead of stewing you from a high cross earlier like earlier rather than just rotate my head inside lift this leg pinch here and then I'm gonna go to that corkscrew finish which we've already learned in our last segment of the DVD all right good give that a try it's one of my favorite takedowns from the two-on-one

'duration': 2.06}]",first thing we're going to talk about today is our five lines of defense okay the I know there is a lot of different theories on this and every coach has their their own idea and their own concepts on how that should be approached and I'm here today to share with you what I think in my opinion and what I found successful through my journey to my my my Olympic journey so far and my coaching journey as well okay five lines of defense here's what we're starting with number one to me the most important thing is using our heads right told him fighting after all a lot of if you watch a lot of high-level wrestlers you're going to see that they won't immediately to make contact with your opponent so they can feel where they're going what they're doing so there are no surprises while we wrestle okay so when we understand as soon as we shake hands and as soon as the match begins I mean if you want to put my hand on him okay whether it's on the head whether it's on the shoulder usually the hand it's the closest thing to me right so as soon as we shake hands I want to put my hand on his head now the way I explain this with with with when I first started teaching this okay one the way I explain this with even with little kids okay I coached some seventeen eight year old kids and I start teaching them this and the first thing that I the the first thing I used to compare this to is this okay for others can't right and what about star wrestling and if I were to close my eyes and I can't see anything okay now will I be able to feel what he's doing where he's going and where he's attacking me from he's he lowering his level he's he's standing up what's happening right if I close mine I would have no idea where he's going right I can I'll be completely lost I'll end up getting blast double you know outside of the man okay so what I wanted to do is I immediately want to put my hands on it and this is the the comparison I use okay if I put one finger on his head only one finger okay and I close my eyes now okay and I'm gonna have jr. move when I close my eyes and see if I can feel what he's doing where he's going okay so I'll close my eyes and I'm at one finger on them okay so move slow [Music] okay as you can see I have a lot better of an idea of where he's gone and that's with my eyes closed right imagine if I can see and have an feel right now we're using two senses that are very very important then it's gonna be a lot less surprise here okay he's not gonna be able to surprise me I'm gonna feel exact and see exactly where he's going and my chances of being surprised here by him on a lot lot less right there slim slim okay so again we're gonna be understand foot first thing that we're gonna do as soon as we shake Kent I want to touch okay I'm gonna text with one hand touch right here what is this one or this one okay now step number two line of defense number two if you were to beat my hand okay and there's couple ways you can do that he can snap or he can peel right the foot here he can snap peel yeah son okay so snap number one right he can peel right whatever it may be doesn't really matter as soon as he does that I still want to have contact with him so what I'm going to do is my number two line of defense I needed him to close the gap and go forehead to forehead with him I'm gonna use my head as the second line of defense and offensive mmm okay so we're here the peels immediately closed in and now I can feel him with my head and it's on Kent fighting down here trying to free my own right I'm gonna use my head okay now step number three arms imagine he beat step number one I closely get the distance the gap okay and he beats step number two and now he's trying to get it I'm gonna use my arms immediately to block okay what did it's under when I go under the hook when I closed here whatever it may be my artists Lee gonna get immediately in the way he's gonna have to get through my arms to get in on me okay step number four kiss we're gonna use their hips there's two ways we can use their hips okay step number one in depending on what you've been taught right depending on what your defenses one guys get to your legs right a lot of those sort of put a stop to sprawl you know as fast as you can sprawl heavy hips shoelaces on the map right because that's the easiest concept to understand just getting away from them right but sometimes actually it's more effective to to face him to kill the momentum just feed him the hips is what I call it this so since he's getting in we hit with the hips to kill the momentum and then wind-ups problem ok it's gonna be a lot harder for him to follow and stay with me so here's what this looks like the killer momentum and sprawl case well if he's shooting just go ahead and shoot the same a high crotch ok from this thing yeah I'm going to kill little man ok feeling the hips and then immediately number to kill more and there's no problem ok it's gonna be a lot harder for him to drag through when I killed that initial initial momentum that initial momentum forward that he's got going ok so again step number one we shake camps with post he beats that somehow simply were to close the gap is where hand fighting here ok if you were to shoot step number three use my arms right use my lungs to get in the way if she beats my own somehow they get out ok chill little man I'm gonna step number four sprawl ok and step number 5 now is tricks moves technique anything that we got there that you've been taught with coming to play now on step number five ok so again the 5 steps are step number one once you in your sense you're gonna use your hands okay you're gonna touch immediately ok that way you have to sensitive to you using not just your eyes right we're feeling as well step number two we're gonna use our head we're gonna block with her forehead okay we're gonna get really strong here we're gonna use their forehead to block and follow where he's going you know we're gonna mirror his his stance if he's lowering we're gonna lowered with him if she's going on the Left we go over the left if he's gonna ride with the right we're always blocking with her head number three our arms we're gonna use our arms to stop him getting away block however we can okay step number four chips we're gonna feed him the hips kill the momentum sprawl and hopefully we'll beat him there with fallout of defense and if not he's super strong right he's done a super good job of setting up his shop getting in and squeezing and driving through we're gonna use our step number five which is technique tricks anything that we know as far as skill set goes for defense okay I hope that makes sense and let's go on to what's next you

those are for me keeping my hands inside keeping pressure forward on my opponent and keeping my opponent's weight on his hands if I can do those three things that I'm gonna be able to hold the guy down I'm gonna be able to ride them I'm gonna collect my writing time and after that be able to bring the guy down get turns and score some points so for me I always have to stop you guys first move before I look to turn him okay because all the whistle guys are explosive they're trying to explode up they're trying to get to their feet and for me if I can stop their first move and kind of settle them down then I have a lot better chance to turn okay so the way that I stopped first move right off the whistle all right my hands are coming inside just like this I like my front hand to come up in the armpit this hand come down inside of me for a pride the next thing I'm gonna drop my chest back and drive and get pressure forward that's gonna put his weight on his hands so this is where I want to be right here I'll pull my toes drive it into the guy one hand on the pride other hand up in the armpit okay kind of keeping this guy extended if he's in a ball if he's sitting back like this guys like this are really hard to ride so I got a driver board I want a lot of space here okay I'm gonna keep them extended just like this all right so back up face up so my starting position this hand or this foot excuse me just ready to drive into him all right one hand on the belly one hand elbow off the whistle hold weight on his hands my hands are inside just like this right here okay now to get um I've stopped his first move so to get my anchors in what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put my knee in front of his knee and I'm gonna pump his leg back that creates the space underneath his ankle for me to hook his like just like this okay now I got his leg hooked I'm gonna pinch my heel to my butt and slide my belly button lungs off his back just like this okay so I got his leg hooked right here that's my anchor that's gonna ensure that I cannot hold this guy down and make sure that I'm controlling this guy all right and I'm able to work my turns after this so again he's set up he's got his butt back all right I need to give us a buck for it I need to get weight on his hands so I'm ready to drive inside bumping him forward all right one hand up an armpit this hand down on the meat now I bump this leg back right here hook belly button comes up on the middle goes back and then my heart mom's right back inside making sure that I'm up on my toes I'm pressuring into the sky okay just like this and I'm ready to ready to swerve all right so one more time don't face the other way so just start off Hayden's coming inside driving uber up on my toes all right once I'm here pry just like this bump his knee back look and now I slide my belly button up harness back pull my heels my butt use my toe to drive just like this that's wrong you

leg lead that means that I need to match his lead leg with my arm okay so we call that and stop sign right come on Rob right here and that's the stop sign the reason that I do that is if my partner is gonna shoot if he's a left leg lead he's gonna be shooting with his left hand okay so this is the arm that I need to pay attention to now he's gonna choose sweep single leg I got a biblical on right here if he's gonna shoot a high crotch his arm right there okay so that's the first thing that I'm paying attention to when out in the open now when I want to build up into my tie I like to post on the head to start okay and then I'm gonna close the gap okay so I post the head and close the gap and I'm getting to my call all right now the reason that I do that is if I just reach to the collar

both sides of his body all right so that means that I need to be inside on both sides so I can see the collar and then I get a tricep go down right here so I'm controlling both sides of this body all right this is where I want to be again match lead leg focus on the head close the gap get to my collar inside right here all right once I'm here I'm gonna elbow down palm up I'm gonna take small steps

inside right here now I'm starting to pressure what that's gonna do is it's gonna listen to the response my opponents gonna pressure back and once he starts a pressure back into me I'm gonna pull in circle just like this own circle okay I don't let go to the tie I keep a hold of it I started pressure again he pressures back pulling circle pressure board and pressures back home sir right there okay stand inside controlling the ties this does a few things this gets my opponent to start to move his feet okay I'm also I also have my weight on him I'm pulling this head down it's going to get

anything from the crackdown crackdown position is extremely extremely common in both freestyle and folk style so it's important that we know how to defend once we're in that position if you don't know the crackdown is I'm going to show you right now it's gonna kind of go over the basics of it crackdown results from a high crotch where I get into my high crotch I can either force this by kind of coming low ankle here getting to here or another way to get there is if I shoot he pulls me into this crap so typically crackdown position is that he's on his butt he's gonna have his hands locked here I'm in on this leg I have some techniques I like a lot from the offensive side of this that you can check out but we're going to focus on the defensive side today so basically Tony's goal right now is about to let me switch off to a double if he's just sitting here on his butt and not really doing anything just put your leg straight out my obviously is gonna be able to switch off and get a double so he's kind of reacting here just being in a solid defensive position so I'm kind of stuck so this is what we'll call the crack down position he's the defensive guy on the offensive guy here and a lot of people get stalemated here because they don't know what to do on both sides of this I'm all kinds of and defensive so we'll focus a little bit on our next couple finishes I want to do from this defensive position in the crackdown you

wrestling today with chase pammi chase is one of my former teammates at the Pennsylvania Regional Training Center in Philadelphia and today we had him in to do an instructional video what I'm really excited about Chase has a lot of great knowledge that he shared with us today a lot of great throws and upper body stuff that he's been really successful with over the years Chase is a two-time all-american national finalists for Cal Poly in 2010 he was also a two-time World Cup team member for the USA took fourth at the 2012 Olympic Trials and fourth at the 2013 World Team Trials has been all over the world has a wealth of knowledge and we're happy to have him here today and today right now he's just got to go over one of his favorite moves the arm throw and so yeah Chase is gonna not take it away here and show us the arm throw yeah so this is this is this is a fun move I learned this growing up by United judo growing up and then translate over to wrestling great move for freestyle especially can work and post folk style but great opportunity score for points so we're gonna talk you through some of the main points we go to this side a couple things are really important when I'm doing an arm throw one thing I like to do when I'm just kind of starting to set this up and starting to go through this is really working the leg pull my opponent pull my partner towards me to get him leaning forward I can't throw somebody if they're if they're standing too far up and if their hips underneath them if they're in good position fans are good wrestling stances can be really hard for me to throw him so I have to get them leaning forward pull them leaning forward leaning forward okay the other thing that's a part of this is my back step so before I go here I'm gonna back step I'm gonna keep my arm short right here on my throw some keep my arms shorting the stroke here and then I'm gonna do this back step I'm gonna drop both knees not just one I'm gonna drop the both knees keep my chest high okay you might keep my chest high that's gonna allow me to pop them through when I throw them and the other pieces I don't want to roll forward this visit so what I want to stay high up here get a good little snap and throw so that's hard to show its emotion so I'm gonna show you three times here I'm gonna show you once we'll go through it and talk to talk a little bit more technique so I'll pull down over here throw one more more throw here so great move for freestyle great option to go and score points with I was good after one there but one thing I've noticed sitting that chased us here I've had to hit this hump me a lot of times in practice it never gets any more fun or less painful but one thing if you notice when I chase is pulling in my arm here and holding it towards his chest he's keeping that in tight the entire time all right if he's creating space here and he goes to try to step in it's gonna be really hard I'm just too far away there's a lot of hip separation there so Chase is doing a really good job pulling this in tight and then again when he was say they pull me in and get me to lean into him and now he's got this loaded up and you can pop his hips in and throw me over top yeah so again guys taste Pandey was just didn't today film this instructional video and be out on the next I don't know month or so once we get it all finished up but are thankful to have them in check out this video if you like this and yeah just keep on plugging away with kinetic recipe thanks guys

just went over a couple takedowns from clearing wrist ties or from when you have wrists uh i've already mentioned that naturally we're all wrestling from thai a lot so it wasn't something that i was gonna go over today another component of wrestling is how to wrestle from open space and have shots from there so sometimes maybe i'm really good at ties and i really like ties so i think why do i need an open shot but one of these guys really good defensively and they like wrestling from thai and they're clearing and they're you know keeping me at assistance away faking a lot or something and they just they won't engage right so i think it always helps to be versatile so if you have a shot from open it's just another tool of the toolbox what i'm going to teach you today is a little single it's one of my favorite moves because i think it's super low risk and when it becomes muscle memory i think it's really easy to get so what i'm going to have my partner do for everyone that's learning this i'm going to have my partner stand neutral square stance right so this would be staggered stance if they have one leg forward i want them to stand neutral for the sake of drilling this and learning this and again for those of you that know although single follow along because maybe there's some parts of this that you haven't heard or learned before or it's always good to just feel something once to feel it in your body and see how it fits or works for you it's either going to reinforce what you like or you could learn something new so i have my partners stan yeah stance square square stance all right so both of his feet are together because i'm picking which leg i want to go to all right so i like to load single on the same foot that i need i like to low single um that foot so my legs lean forward i like to low cycle his left leg all right so what i do and i'm going to explain these things they're really specific points actually really specific points all right drill these hundreds and hundreds of time until this is muscle memory um they're super important i teach them at camps all the time and uh still sometimes i see kids just forgetting certain ones of them so these i just think are super super solid so i'm in my skins all right a low single is um i'm lowering my level and i'm i'm actually shooting straight across right so there's sweep singles where i'm turning my body or there's just a regular single where i'm shooting in all right this i really think about it's i lower my level all right and i have to do this from distance okay and my back foot okay is loaded all right my hips are low so when i say lower level and you go like this that's not it's not correct okay all body position wrestling is pretty similar you

block it with my head and I'm going to I'm going to lower my level when I block him with my head so that he so that I stay in good position and that I'm not extended so again he shoots I block with my head I block with my head and I Circle away that's the first line of defense and a good way to drill that take your hands out of the picture go got shoots I block with my head he shoots I block with my head okay so the second line of defense are your hands your hands aren't just here to to be there in wrestling for offense they're there for defense as well so he takes a shot I'm going block with my hands and I'm going to lower my level and uh so not keep my arm straight so if I block with my hands and I keep my arm straight he can post up get that double leg so when he shoots blocks come and I want to get get my hips back bend my arms lower my level and recover my headline of Defense so get that first line of defense back so again he gets past my first line hands get my head back third line you got it yep from there we're going to go to our third line of defense which is going to be your forearms or your billy clubs what's going to happen is if he gets past your first second line you're going to have to use your forearm to block him back so if he takes the shot and he blocks my hands the next line has to be my forearms once I get my forearms I get my body back and now I recover back into my first line of defense got his head back right in position so once again if he gets past my hand I got to use my forearms to block him after that I can push him back off and I'm recovering my first and second line of defense last line of defense is going to be your hips if he's able to get past your head your hands your forearms last is going to be your hips it's a little tough but what's going to happen is as he shoots in I have to hip in hard after the hip I got to get my HPS uh back and sprawl away from them so if you to take a shot and gets past everything I have to be able to hip sprawl get my hips back and either I'm going to back away or I'm going to look to score off the position you can use short offense sprawl and spin either one works again so he takes a shot he gets in I got to stop him real quick sprawl back keep my head up either I'm going to spin and score or I can push away and I'm back to my stance

able to achieve in a wrestling stance forward and backward lateral left and right and circling clockwise and counterclockwise or left and right let's talk about your lead leg most of you watching this 90 of you are gonna have your right leg as your lead leg if you're not completely sure what your lead leg should be just stand relaxed try not to think about anything and have someone push you from behind whatever leg steps forward that's your lead leg and wherever you step that's about where you're going to want your lead leg to sit now let's talk about hip level you want your hips low as low as your anatomy allows if you're an older student you have bad knees you might not be able to get too low just get as low as you can you don't want to be standing straight up you want to have some hinge in your hips with your chest treading floating over your lead leg knee okay and i always keep a straight back i don't want any roundness in my back i don't want my head going low i want a nice straight back with my head up let's talk about hand placement where do i want my hands iowa style there's two main options for your hands iowa style which is a strict defensive hand over my lead leg my lead leg's going to be closest to my opponent so the thought being i am going to want to prioritizing protecting this leg keeping a hand nice and disciplined over top of it my attack hand my backhand making contact first or the oklahoma state style stance with your elbow sort of t-rex pulled to your arms ready to jut out and attack creating motion from here all the while guys i'm never tense i'm never tense here i maintain good position but i'm nice and loose and relaxed a lot of times you'll see wrestlers do this kind of stuff or they let their arms jig out or stutter step they're just reminding themselves to stay relaxed they're just taking a small break here creating some fluid motion okay so our hip level is low but not so low that we're past parallel with our femur to the mat okay our arms are either io style defensively out in front we call this our shield hand and our attack or our sword hand or oklahoma state style with our elbows pulled in tight to our sides here okay now when we're creating the motion that we want in our stance whatever way you're going that's the leg that's going to lead so if i'm moving forward my lead leg leads the movement if i'm going backwards you guessed it my back leg leads the movement and circling whichever way i circle leads the movement and i'm never over stepping i always want to achieve short choppy steps i'm never going too wide okay i want to have short fast choppy steps always keeping my feet under me so there i have an increased ability to attack so if you want to learn wrestling one of the first things you have to do is condition your legs you have to be able to move through all of these ranges of motion without coming out of your stance the moment you come out of position you leave yourself vulnerable for a leg attack and also you're not in position then to attack their legs so start a timer and go through all of these ranges of motion for as long as you can and then when you absolutely can't take it anymore your legs are on fire they're burning wait five more seconds and come out of your stance go and check your timer rest let your body recover then repeat that process three more times all in your staggered stance repeat this process for a week or two to condition your legs in a way that's applicable for grappling guys forget the squat rack forget your leg jumps just work on your stance just do stance work that's plenty enough conditioning you'll see it's gonna be plenty enough conditioning for your legs and you're building strength that's applicable for grappling then we'll see you guys back here to learn your very first [Music] takedown

accessible meaning it has less moving parts maybe a little easier to learn it should also be effective meaning it works at the elementary middle school high school college and international level and the blast double satisfies all of these categories if you think for a moment fire on my feet how far do you think i could throw a javelin pretty far now how far could i throw that from my knees now how far could i throw it from my back so utility of wrestling the utility of takedowns is the ability to take an opponent where they can generate their most power their most dangerous to their back where they can create generate the least amount of power their least dangerous and if you want to have that ability as quickly as possible start with a takedown that is most easy to learn okay guys if you've never hit a blast double before have your partner stand at scarecrow hands wide feet wide then get down in your wrestling stance push off your back leg into a lunge step your lead leg is going to step deep between his legs right to here and your hands jut out like hooks on the back of his knees you want your widow's peek right in the middle of his gut right above his above his belly button we're not here we're not battering ramp if my face is pointed down that's where i can go you can also stuff my head here making life hard i'm up here like this i don't really have leverage with my neck i want to marry the two be right in the middle and then as i drive forward pulling my elbows in i t my head forward now if i'm going to achieve this position i have to clear his hands out of the way because he's eventually going to be in a stance if i don't clear his hands out of the way they're more than likely going to catch me on the way in if i just shoot right he can under hook me he can stop me can sprawl i need to get him thinking uh i need to create motion get his hands moving out of the way how can i do that without even having to touch his hands i reach towards his face i'm gonna take advantage of an evolutionary trait evolutionary instinct that when an object goes towards your face you're gonna try to protect your face so on my entry as i'm entering in i camouflage my movement with this reach so it's as if i'm falling almost i'm leaning over my lead leg i'm leaning over my lead leg i give him something to react to push off your back leg your power leg step and pull your elbows back into your body and then they jut out here this is what a lot of you are going to do you're going to go here and then you're going to windmill your arms because it's going to feel more comfortable at first you see how narrow my legs are in my entry it's like you're walking on a balance beam so naturally if you're not developed here if you're not comfortable here you're going to be trying to catch your balance and that's why your hands windmill out fight that instinct and discipline yourself if my if my elbows are out in my shot he's just going to catch me and pull me up right if my elbows are out on my shot now he's going to pull me up and do under hooks and we're wrestling from there i don't want to be wrestling there i just want to get a good clean take down and the whole time like doing short choppy steps keeping my feet underneath me if i ever start to lunge forward and my chest starts to get out in front of my lead leg i'm gonna fall down with him he could roll me through he could do any number of things catch you in a submission you want to stay on your feet with practice staying on your feet okay if this is traditional wrestling you can go down with him work for a pin but uh for self-defense and bjj you wanna you wanna be on your feet here you have options on your feet one more time and keep in mind guys this does require a bit of neck strength so don't go all out on your first day hitting this hit maybe 10 to 20 reps max and see how you feel the next day and you can increase the reps and intensity from there also make sure you have a nice padded ground that you're hitting this on if you're indoors lay down some blankets maybe some cushions do the best you can and just be aware of your surroundings and you can definitely hit this out in a park in the grass somewhere just be mindful

takedown you know what you're aiming for okay so let's talk about actions and reactions from our stance even if you don't have a wide grappling knowledge or a wide array of takedowns in your arsenal yet working on these actions and reactions will develop neural pathways in your brain and develop muscle motion and movement so when you go to learn other takedowns they will come more easily there's real value to doing stance and motion work it's wrestling's equivalent to shadow boxing the basic movements of your actions and reactions from your stance the drop step the sprawl the head position block and the down block with your hands one of the most basic foundational movements in all of wrestling and grappling is your penetration step or your drop step i'm stepping deep closing the distance between my partner and i and then my knee is driving down to the ground my chest stays over my lead leg knee this allows me to cover distance at a very low safe angle getting underneath his head hands defense so he's in a good stance i need to get underneath i need to get low right and my drop step helps me achieve that i step my knee is over my chest is over my knee my elbows are in my knees going to drive down between his legs and then my chest comes up head up hips in back straight you're going to hear that on every single technique video about shooting head up hips and back straight right so how we drill this um how we drill this if you're just doing stance in motion stay down low stance step forward center line down in the stance step forward center line knee goes down over my toe then i repeat the process with my other leg and you get this marching motion where you're just going back and forth start coordinating your arms now with the movement act as if there's someone there's someone in front of you so as my knee drives over my toe and it's about to hit the ground that's about when i would be pulling my hands or pulling his legs in towards my body my head would come up and i can repeat the motion with the other leg and you can get in a nice long field you can get on the carpet inside maybe get some knee pads go slow wear some sweatpants if you're stuck inside and just go slow right you want to get very very comfortable with this drop step it's if you're a bjj guy it's all it's a lot like shrimping it's one of the most foundational movements you're going to find yourself using again and again and again in many different takedowns so if you want to get proficient at your takedowns get better your takedowns just mastering or getting better at this movement the drop step is going to greatly increase your chances and your success rate and your takedowns [Music] now what's the defensive equivalent to our drop step that would be our sprawl so if our partner is using a drop step to shoot at our legs how do we defend that a sprawl right so alex is taking a deep step his knees going over his toes doing a good drop step and he's getting sorry to my legs what i have to do here is sprawl three things have to happen my legs have to go back my hips have to go in and his head has to go down okay i have to get my hands on if we were facing camera here i push on the top of his head my feet go back and my hips go in this one to here my hips go in okay i'm fighting pressure with pressure if i don't push my hips in and he's driving through and my and i simply just push here and try to get my legs back but my hips don't come in he's eventually going to catch up to me okay i have to meet pressure with pressure so as soon as he gets in i hip in legs back head down get in your foot headlock just stuff the shot [Music] [Music] you put your laces on the mat even if you're not wearing shoes you know your laces would be put your laces on the mat right if my toes are on the mat and then i'm putting a post here for him to drive into right i want to slide if he starts driving at all i want to slide and that'll also help position my hips to push in more high level rustlers though know that there's an additional layer of defense actually two layers of additional defense before you actually sprawl it's your head defense and hands defense what you want to think about is keeping your head level just a half inch below his at all times then he has to pass through your line of vision just to get to your leg so what do i mean by that we're in stance facing each other and we're even he can slip underneath me i just keep my eyeline half inch underneath his so when he goes to shoot he passes through my eyeline and i can just meet him with my head right and i don't even have to sprawl i save a lot of energy i keep them at bay without ever having to use macro movements okay so what does that look like if you've never done this before go very very slow okay have your partner take a slow shot and then catch your head in the nook of his shoulder and neck right here so we're gonna get stamped partner takes a slow shot i match it right and he never he never closes the distance he will always be spine length distance away from my legs and hips now what happens if he beats my head position he gets underneath my head and he's shooting in my hips so we stroll then no we actually have another line of defense that's your hands defense so partner beats my head because underneath and i'm actually going to down block from here that's another reason why we keep our elbows in our shot and then i can pull him up down blocking not only stops his shot but allows me to stay in good position so i can immediately shoot one of the best times to shoot is right after your opponent's shot it's called a re-shot so alex shoots i keep my hands inside i catch him here i pulled him up that's one of the best times for me to shoot so if you want to practice down blocking right get a partner and have them shoot a couple double eggs at first maybe a couple single legs if you know them and then practice jutting your hands out this is another reason why um i tend to prefer the oklahoma state style stance with my hands keep my hands my elbows tight to my ribs so i can pop them out i can actually punch i feel like with the iowa style my hands already extended so i can't create any force outward but here i can so if he goes to shoot i can punch i can meet that pressure with my own pressure okay so practice this a couple times if he's gonna hit a sweep single all i have to do is punch with one arm for here alex is hitting his sweat right he's pulling to here i can punch to this side if he's hitting a high crotch she's grabbing a collar tie here and then his hands coming inside i down block here and you want to generally think about stepping the leg that they're attacking away all right they're tacking both legs on a double leg that may look like this there's going to be less movement generally here if he's shooting in right you want to meet pressure or pressure on a double leg if he's hitting a high crotch i want to create as much distance between him and the leg he's attacking so as he's he's collar tied he's coming head inside i can step my leg back as i down block okay and then when he goes to hit a sweet single collar tie he's going to sweep i do the same thing to the other side i step the leg back with my down block thanks alex so when i go to hit this with my stance in motion this is what it looks like now i have to visualize this without a partner i'm in a stance he's going to hit a double leg i can down block down block i envision my partner is going to hit a sweep i down block pivoting on my lead leg if he's hitting that high crotch the head outside single on my lead leg i'm going to cross cross and my trail leg becomes the pivot leg he's attacking lead leg down block pivot block pivot down block pivot now let's tie them all together set a timer for about two maybe three minutes depending on where your conditioning is at and in your head start rotating through all of your actions and reactions in your stance i envision my partner gets past my head hands defense i have to straw come on i reach [Music] shoot down one down lock strong [Music] shoot [Music] sprawl again and again and again see how active you can get in that two or three minute period timer goes off stop catch your breath repeat it two to three times just do this for six to ten minutes right it's gonna be plenty of a cardiovascular workout and not only that instead of just jogging you're developing your motion you're developing your action reactions for grappling for an actual skill okay so these are this encompasses the actions and the basic actions and reactions from a rustling perspective from a wrestling stance so like i said previously guys start a timer and try to go for three two minute periods getting as intense as you can in those periods if this is your first time doing actions and reactions from a from a shot be reasonable do the best that you can staying disciplined low in your stance stance position being the being of primary importance and then achieving your actions and reactions from that position track how you're doing you know if you can only get 30 seconds the first day aim for 40 seconds the second day if you could get two minutes off out the gate and that's too easy maybe go for three minutes on your on your um on your next go okay so we're developing intensity and length in our drills over time and that builds strength and conditioning that's applicable to wrestling and grappling

all of wrestling all grappling all the fighting it's the traditional double leg it feeds off of our blast there's a reason i teach it right after the blast is because the two feet into each other as you'll see in the technique video it's not all that different we get a little bit lower drive a little bit deeper we're level changing one more time from here okay the reason i prioritize these techniques is because they're the most accessible there are other techniques that might be more applicable for your body type but they take longer to learn so you need to get your feet wet so you cannot under so you can start understanding the concepts of takedowns closing the distance between you and your opponent mat utilizing the drop step this is the first technique that we're going to use where we're actually using our drop step so hopefully you've watched the stance in motion video if you haven't go check that out and we're actually going to be using it now and you'll see why stance in motion is so important before learning an actual take now like always guys if you've never hit a takedown you've never hit this takedown a traditional double leg have your partner start a scarecrow we're gonna take a deep penetration step between their legs as far as we can get chest over knee elbows disciplined into our sides our knees gonna drive over our toe to the ground as it does that my chest and head are going to come up to here my trail leg comes up and posts to the side pushing off my back leg deep knee drives over my toe elbows in knee hits the ground as it hits the ground my chest comes up to here this is not good head position this is not good head position even this is not good head position this is good head position you see how his body starts to tilt the direction i'm going to drive my trail leg comes up and posts to the side not straight in front to the side i'm changing directions ideally i get my hands locked behind him in a monkey grip you can go gable grip or even an s grip i prefer the monkey paw grip over top my wrist if i can't get this if he starts to sprawl on my entry his legs are going back now i don't have the length of my arms to get my hands locked i can still finish if my head is up my hips are in my back and straight i have the structure of my skeleton supporting his weight not my muscular system then i'm going to push off this lead leg or my trail rig trail leg rather on to my lead leg i want to be on both legs when i drive maximizing my power my head is leading the movement i look hard in the direction i want to go and then i pull my elbows in as i drive now we have to use the setup in order to get to his legs because he's going to be down in a stance i'm going to use the exact same setup i use in my blast double i'm going to reach towards his face as his hands come up i swoop underneath so you want to be knocking him back on his heels by the time that you get to him you want to think shoot through him not to him so he's trying to catch his balance on his heels by the time you are changing direction sideways change level down change level in change level across three different level changes just like my blast i'm leaning over my lead leg i reach step elbows come in i want to be knocking him back with my shoulder by the time i get there post hook just below his butt grip if you can if you can't you can still finish head leaves the movement push up onto both feet my hips stay underneath me i'm not here my butt is not extended i need my butt under my shoulders here and drive drive pull your knees into side control if you're a bjj guy just keep your shoulders shrugged everyone's afraid of getting guillotined here on your entry as you're entering shrug your shoulders and keeping trucks circumvent that problem from ever happening and even if he does wrap up the guillotine from here even if he does make sure you just circle your hips to the opposite side of your head if i'm here and i'm driving driving driving and my and i'm on the same my hips end up on the same side as my head i'm in trouble but if i practice driving with my hips to the other side of the head then you can actually finish him with a bonfood choke if he doesn't abandon this position you can finish him [Music] like i'm shooting under a stick like this is reverse limbo right i want to get underneath i'm gonna get as low as i can underneath his head hands defense i get low chest over knee now pretend there's a stick here and i want my back to graze it on my way up i want to graze it so i go under the stick head stays up my back grazes it and see how there's no space between me and his legs i'm not up here i'm not hinging at the hips at all okay not even the least bit i'm completely straight head up hips in back straight and my hands pull his legs in as i drive it's not enough just to drive i have to pull his legs in as i drive so i'm driving pulling his legs in and then i'm circling my legs to the opposite side of my head the reason i teach this in combination with the blast we're teaching it right after the blast double is because one commonly leads into the other if i'm going to hit my blast double right if i'm going to hit my blast and my partner circles right if i go to my blasting circles on my entry this becomes a traditional double vice versa if i go to hit my traditional double and he circles the other way i go to my head outside he circles this way it just becomes a blast okay no matter how much you practice one or the other you can't completely ever control your opponent he's gonna have movement commonly he's gonna have movement on your entry so train both to greatly increase your chances of finishing now now for guys who are really good defensively if you're dealing with a guy who has incredible balance maybe he's a really good athlete and you keep driving keep driving he just won't go down you're gonna have to lift him you're gonna have to get both of his posts both of his legs off the mat how do i do that ideally again you have hands locked if you don't doesn't matter you still finish you're driving he's just not going down he just keeps catching himself keeps catching himself keeps catching himself i'm gonna step around with my lead leg all the way around to his far leg step and then i'm going to pop my hips i'm not dead lifting stay right here i'm not dead lifting i'm popping my hips and tilting my shoulders and using my head in combination with my arms to get him to go horizontal you're gonna flare his legs so you come up to both legs he won't go down i step across i pop flare [Music] huh so as always guys be mindful of your surroundings if you're getting this inside clear stuff out of the way all right don't just start hitting this in your living room lay down some pillows some blankets and be mindful of where you're at maybe you you're not ready until you get on an actual rustling mat or a bjj mat maybe you're not ready to flare the legs yet if you're not ready just pick them straight up as you step around with your lead leg just pick them straight up so you can at least get that lifting motion in your muscular system and then when you get back on the mat you can finish from there if you're outside in the park and you want to hit this in the grass i'm going to leave that up to you and the toughness of your partner

experienced rustlers understand shooting takedowns towards the legs is a high risk high rewards operation the high reward is you get the opponent on the ground you're on top or you can create force and they can't you have maximum options the risk is if you get stuck underneath you're supporting all of your weight and all of their weight so you're potentially shooting into a deficit there is one single technique though that can erase a lot of this fear for you it's called a peek out it's very accessible and you only have to learn it to one side this can take out a ton of your apprehension when you're first learning wrestling or grappling all together just learn how to peek out and when you shoot into your deficit that can become the setup for your peek out your failed shot becomes the setup for a successful back take all right so the peek out i take a bad shot or my opponent just has a really good reaction and they sprawl my way in there will be a split second a moment usually there will be a moment where both arms are draped over my torso allowing me an opportunity to peek out i take a shot alex and we're in this position right bad deficit i'm supporting all my weight all his weight he's supporting none all i have to do is quad hot up whatever your lead leg is that's the leg that's going to cross diagonally sit to your hip and the adjacent arm is going to windmill my elbow is going to windmill above his elbow really simple movement very nuanced get in here and really feel your elbow reach towards his armpit if i'm in here i need to elevate my hip so i can have room to sit through it's not enough to just try and hit it from here you need to create space because he's got weight on you it will drop as you sit through if i go to here you're just going to squish me i need to create space for my hips some guys like to sit to their shin right they think that it creates more mobility for them to turn in some guys like to sit to their hip because it gives me a little more of a level change on my way down i personally like to sit to my hip hips come up quad pod slide underneath and as i slide my elbow goes high into his armpit in this windmill motion and my elbow throws down to the ground it's a whipping motion if you hit it right if you time it right he should fall right here to his hands and when he does all you have to do it's as simple as turning covering taking the back we go from an extreme deficit to an extremely advantageous position and taking it back [Applause] [Music] so one last thing you don't want to get too far outside your opponent as i'm peeking out my head peeks out and he slides off the side of my shoulder i don't want to have any distance here i want this space to be close so when i go to turn into him i have a short distance to cover if i peek out and i sit really far that's too far away now i gotta tape now his hips are gone by the time i turn in inches or miles here stay close a lot of times your peek out can turn into a setup for a double leg to sort of re-shot from this position so i'm in i go to peek out and his hips fall into me my shoulder lands near his hips depending on his movement depending on the number of things you may end up here but since we practice our double leg our traditional double we know how to finish we just post off this far leg and drive and this is how you implement this into stance and motion you don't even really need a partner to hit this shoot your partner sprawl pop up with turning cover this is definitely something that you can drill at home if you want to get good at this if you really want to reduce the fear and apprehension you have with shooting get a hundred of these in a day guys it's no secret with any technique with any skill it's no secret how you get good at things you drill them you practice a lot the more you drill the more time you the more focused dedicated time you commit to a task the better you will get at it there's no way around it set a timer commit to 100 reps a day and then just get it done get a partner you can rely on or maybe you have to use three four partners in a day because they can only dedicate a certain amount of time what is it going to take for you to get better what do you have to do to get better all right you can have excuses or you can have results commit to getting good at takedowns one note of caution guys some people can like to peek out so much they'll actually start deliberately shooting into a deficit they'll start shooting onto their hands and knees because their their number one priority is to get to the peak out never do that we want to have our a game to be shooting clean through to a takedown the peek out allows us to have a solid backup plan if we don't get that you never want to aim to be underneath an opponent supporting all of their weight and your weight at the same time we never want to aim at deficits but we want to have solid backup plans for when that happens the peek out allows that grab a partner and go back and forth and talk to each other as you're doing it when you get a really good repping when the defensive partner who's having the technique hit on them when you can feel that your partner just hit a really good rep talk about it what happened there where was the elbow position where was your knee slide did you go down to your hip did you go down to your butt on that slide what happened there try to just try to dissect exactly what happened become aware of your technique make each other better okay be deliberate be aware in your drilling don't just do mindless drilling don't just go through the motions have hyper focus that'll pay dividends down the road you'll get much better much quicker having deliberate practice other than mindless [Music] practice you

'duration': 14.319}]",one of the most common questions i get is what's the number one takedown what's the best takedown in grappling if you're a bjj guy it's kind of like asking what's the best way to pass if you're a striker it's kind of like being asked what's the best punch it's a hard question you need two three four ways to create offense and then circling between those offenses generally opens one of them up but if i had a gun in my head absolutely had to answer no it would be the single leg okay why the single leg the single leg narrows the fight down to a very small corridor you're using your entire body to attack one of your opponent's appendages so it's not only effective in attacking a smaller or same size opponent but a larger opponent it's a technique that's largely dependent upon leverage and positioning in angles it has less to do with power it does take a little longer to learn it's not as accessible as our double legs that's why i prioritize our double legs they teach you how to cover distance in a quicker way so then when you go to learn the single leg it's more easily absorbed so if i'm facing a larger opponent this is the real utility of the single leg if i'm up against a larger opponent and i'm planning on hitting a double leg it's highly unlikely that i'm going to be able to if i'm an inexperienced grappler that italian like i'd be able to power through his size okay there's a great size and power disparity so using a power and explosive dependent offense is a bad idea that's why i favor the single leg that's why the single leg has such great utility because it will cover and be effective against nearly the most effective takedown against every one of your opponents it our lead leg is dependent upon our opponent's lead leg so frey has his left foot forward that means my right foot has to be forward for my entry to be successful okay do the opposite we were the other way but for display purposes we'll be here i'm going to use the same setup we've been using the reach setup reset up is hyper important when you're going against a larger opponent he has big strong arms i don't want to have to deal with them i don't want to have to touch them so i'm going to clear them out of the way on my entry by reaching retract my elbows and step behind his lead leg i want my post underneath me i can be at his foot behind his foot i can even be slightly in front of his foot but realize that my hands then are going to be over top of my base okay extend it out i want my posts underneath me that's ideal my lead hand swings underneath my trail hand collapses into a gable grip right underneath i keep my grip at his knee i lace my shoulder over the top right in the crook of his hip right where his femur meets his hip okay this is one of the most common mistakes we're gonna see bjj guys make they over commit they go elbow to elbow here now look see where my head position is he can easily stuff my head here and start to sprawl making life really hard on me i my head position will never get the length it needs if i go elbow or hand to elbow i go gable grip look how much length that gives me in my shoulder it can reach up to the far to his hip i do not stack my grip right underneath my shoulder and pinch the leg i want to extend down the teeter totter extend down creating leverage here see how my base is underneath me he's carrying all my weight right here i can hang out here all day there's very little weight on my legs i'm focusing all my weight into the top of his femur right here my head is up and my shoulders are shrugged avoiding guillotines and bulldog chokes if my head is up if my structure is in place my hand structure and shoulder structure my neck will be safe okay i'm keeping my grip nice and tight my elbows are not flared they're pulled into my ribs tight i make this leg a part of me i'm pulling my grip in i'm cinching everything in tight and keeping my shoulder laced over top this creates a very tight base now he has to adhere to my body weight when i sag my weight see him go down he's going to have to come down with me i take one teeny tiny step forward left leg or trail leg one teeny tiny step backwards with my inside leg right leg and then i sit him down so again on my entry i reach protract step deep aiming to get behind his heel or at least at his foot hand wraps around to the knee lace over top stay close we do not hang out here okay this is a transitory position you want to spend as little time here as possible so many bjj practitioners get in here and they they even close their legs this only cements the position this is not this is not a position we hang out in okay i'm only here so i can i want to enter in with my structure already set so i reach i enter my structure set now i just have to step step step step and it's like he's riding on a little slide okay it's like there's a little 45 degree slide 45 degree angle sloping down to the ground where i'm going to step step pressure down and back human beings aren't that good at walking backwards especially on one leg okay so i get him on one leg and then i'm going to make him move backwards with pressure moving down to here and i also like to slide out to the ankle right so after i whip him down i release my grip and slide up to the ankle i want to keep i want to keep a hand on him i want to stay connected here okay if i let go of him he has a chance to base up get his feet underneath him so i keep a foot if this is a fight he has a chance to up kick okay if this is bjj he has a chance to try and pull guard so i keep a foot i keep my hand on his ankle slide it out to here and then you can lift and enter any way you want you have options here but keep a hand on one more time and enter with force enter with force here okay your shoulder needs to knock him back you're aiming for the crook of his hip where his femur meets his hip enter right here see i can knock back on this foot even if he's a big guy i'm attacking him at a center of gravity with a very acute point in my shoulder here another thing is when guys go hand to elbow they distribute that pressure over a large area of their chest okay that's not an acute point of pressure i'm distributing that off all throughout his leg especially if he's a big guy i need to make all my weight count all of my pressure count meaning my shoulder will be much more useful than my chest everything's pulled in tight my head is up this is not good head position okay guys this is good head position and you see how my shoulders are tilted that gives me even more length to my arm if my shoulders are parallel to the mat you see how this arm gets shorter and now my shoulder is never going to get to where it needs to go so many bjj guys do this they hold on to the leg and they just stand here like this or like this how do you expect to take anybody down you need to create you need to give him a reason to go down need to give him pressure on his leg to go down lace that shoulder over top pull that knee in step step sit down slide out to the angle so that's good yep

'duration': 14.319}]",one of the most common questions i get is what's the number one takedown what's the best takedown in grappling if you're a bjj guy it's kind of like asking what's the best way to pass if you're a striker it's kind of like being asked what's the best punch it's a hard question you need two three four ways to create offense and then circling between those offenses generally opens one of them up but if i had a gun in my head absolutely had to answer no it would be the single leg okay why the single leg the single leg narrows the fight down to a very small corridor you're using your entire body to attack one of your opponent's appendages so it's not only effective in attacking a smaller or same size opponent but a larger opponent it's a technique that's largely dependent upon leverage and positioning in angles it has less to do with power it does take a little longer to learn it's not as accessible as our double legs that's why i prioritize our double legs they teach you how to cover distance in a quicker way so then when you go to learn the single leg it's more easily absorbed so if i'm facing a larger opponent this is the real utility of the single leg if i'm up against a larger opponent and i'm planning on hitting a double leg it's highly unlikely that i'm going to be able to if i'm an inexperienced grappler that italian like i'd be able to power through his size okay there's a great size and power disparity so using a power and explosive dependent offense is a bad idea that's why i favor the single leg that's why the single leg has such great utility because it will cover and be effective against nearly the most effective takedown against every one of your opponents it our lead leg is dependent upon our opponent's lead leg so frey has his left foot forward that means my right foot has to be forward for my entry to be successful okay do the opposite we were the other way but for display purposes we'll be here i'm going to use the same setup we've been using the reach setup reset up is hyper important when you're going against a larger opponent he has big strong arms i don't want to have to deal with them i don't want to have to touch them so i'm going to clear them out of the way on my entry by reaching retract my elbows and step behind his lead leg i want my post underneath me i can be at his foot behind his foot i can even be slightly in front of his foot but realize that my hands then are going to be over top of my base okay extend it out i want my posts underneath me that's ideal my lead hand swings underneath my trail hand collapses into a gable grip right underneath i keep my grip at his knee i lace my shoulder over the top right in the crook of his hip right where his femur meets his hip okay this is one of the most common mistakes we're gonna see bjj guys make they over commit they go elbow to elbow here now look see where my head position is he can easily stuff my head here and start to sprawl making life really hard on me i my head position will never get the length it needs if i go elbow or hand to elbow i go gable grip look how much length that gives me in my shoulder it can reach up to the far to his hip i do not stack my grip right underneath my shoulder and pinch the leg i want to extend down the teeter totter extend down creating leverage here see how my base is underneath me he's carrying all my weight right here i can hang out here all day there's very little weight on my legs i'm focusing all my weight into the top of his femur right here my head is up and my shoulders are shrugged avoiding guillotines and bulldog chokes if my head is up if my structure is in place my hand structure and shoulder structure my neck will be safe okay i'm keeping my grip nice and tight my elbows are not flared they're pulled into my ribs tight i make this leg a part of me i'm pulling my grip in i'm cinching everything in tight and keeping my shoulder laced over top this creates a very tight base now he has to adhere to my body weight when i sag my weight see him go down he's going to have to come down with me i take one teeny tiny step forward left leg or trail leg one teeny tiny step backwards with my inside leg right leg and then i sit him down so again on my entry i reach protract step deep aiming to get behind his heel or at least at his foot hand wraps around to the knee lace over top stay close we do not hang out here okay this is a transitory position you want to spend as little time here as possible so many bjj practitioners get in here and they they even close their legs this only cements the position this is not this is not a position we hang out in okay i'm only here so i can i want to enter in with my structure already set so i reach i enter my structure set now i just have to step step step step and it's like he's riding on a little slide okay it's like there's a little 45 degree slide 45 degree angle sloping down to the ground where i'm going to step step pressure down and back human beings aren't that good at walking backwards especially on one leg okay so i get him on one leg and then i'm going to make him move backwards with pressure moving down to here and i also like to slide out to the ankle right so after i whip him down i release my grip and slide up to the ankle i want to keep i want to keep a hand on him i want to stay connected here okay if i let go of him he has a chance to base up get his feet underneath him so i keep a foot if this is a fight he has a chance to up kick okay if this is bjj he has a chance to try and pull guard so i keep a foot i keep my hand on his ankle slide it out to here and then you can lift and enter any way you want you have options here but keep a hand on one more time and enter with force enter with force here okay your shoulder needs to knock him back you're aiming for the crook of his hip where his femur meets his hip enter right here see i can knock back on this foot even if he's a big guy i'm attacking him at a center of gravity with a very acute point in my shoulder here another thing is when guys go hand to elbow they distribute that pressure over a large area of their chest okay that's not an acute point of pressure i'm distributing that off all throughout his leg especially if he's a big guy i need to make all my weight count all of my pressure count meaning my shoulder will be much more useful than my chest everything's pulled in tight my head is up this is not good head position okay guys this is good head position and you see how my shoulders are tilted that gives me even more length to my arm if my shoulders are parallel to the mat you see how this arm gets shorter and now my shoulder is never going to get to where it needs to go so many bjj guys do this they hold on to the leg and they just stand here like this or like this how do you expect to take anybody down you need to create you need to give him a reason to go down need to give him pressure on his leg to go down lace that shoulder over top pull that knee in step step sit down slide out to the angle so that's good yep

'start': 534.56, 'duration': 2.08}]",look if you want to get as good as you can as fast as you can in grappling it'd be a good idea to spend the majority of your training in the most common positions that you're going to be ending up in in every single wrestling match every bjj match and every single fight nearly every single one of these categories you end up in what's called the over under position where your chest to chest you have an underhook and an overhook and your partner has the same it's a 50 50 position where both people have equal opportunity we're going to be learning offense from here down the road but in order to make our offense effective we first have to have effective motion in this position and there are a couple drills you can develop and use right now to really develop that motion at some point during the match you're gonna have to close the distance between you and your partner and when that happens a great portion of the time you'll end up in this over on your position let's say i take a shot alex has a good reaction and he catches me on one end and we end up in this over under position i have an underhook he has an underhook i have an overhook he has an overhook it's a 50 50 position how do we advance from here okay i need to be able to create motion if i push it into alex he's more than likely going to start pushing back and when that happens i'm going to clamp down on my underhook and pull and circle see that big step that i get i get him in motion clockwise i get him in motion this way we can repeat that motion alex can push it to me i go to push back these circle pulls i push into him he pushes back i circle pull get comfortable here creating motion the reason i do this is because while he's turning in motion while he's moving in motion his underhook is going to loosen up ever so slightly allowing my overhook to swan dive underneath dig high to double underhooks here okay so if i don't create motion and i simply just dig for an underhook i'm trying to get the double unders if i just dig he's just going to do the same thing on this side and we're going to end up in this endless pummel where we're both just expending energy staying in essentially the exact same position just changing sides so what i do is i disguise with motion i disguise my offense with motion and that also creates a nice little opening here circle pull swan dive underneath hands go to gable grip elbows high my elbows are not low because he can lock his hands between us that's going to nullify my underhooks okay i want my underhooks high once i'm here i'm going to step head side my head's on this side so i'm going to step head side getting perpendicular to his hips once i'm perpendicular i'm going to roll my shoulders and flare my elbow the over hook side my head side i'm going to roll my shoulders and flare my elbow take it back really flare that elbow okay it's another reason why you want your elbows to be high here you want you want it nice and set up to be flared over top if i'm low that's a great distance for him to cover and also the closer your elbows are to your body the stronger you're gonna get okay so his elbows are close to his body here so it's gonna be hard to flare that elbow i want him high with his elbows away from his body then when i go a step with much better likelihood of getting to his back pushing in pushing in circle pull swan dive underneath elbows high step head side and watch my shoulders i'm going to roll my shoulders and it's like a whip i roll my shoulders and then all that momentum flares out to my elbow which flips him over top okay okay guys so what do i do once i get to the back okay once i'm on the back it's not enough just to stand there we have to get him to the ground right all i'm going to do is a very very simple finish from here there's a lot of finishes i'm gonna show you one that's not uh very explosive so it's not gonna cost you a lot of energy and it's gonna then you're gonna end up in a very advantageous position okay all i'm gonna do is step on his far foot okay i'm gonna step on his ankle doesn't matter what side you do it to and i'm gonna sag my hips low and pull him into me slap my hips low see there's a little reverberating motion where i separate my hips from his for a moment so i have some space to yank him back into me back there we go here i don't just stay here and try to fall okay i need to have some motion i need to yank him back into me like a ball and chain i sag my hips and then yank my grip and turn cover very common reaction when you go to take the back when you go to take the back his overhook side that you're trying to whip over is going to clamp down so i step get my hips perpendicular i go to throw and he clamps down on that overhook and i can't flare it over top now can't get it we're gonna use the exact same finish all right as long as my hips have a little bit of an angle here as long as i'm not facing him i have a little bit of an angle i'm gonna do the exact same finish step with my same foot sag my hips and pull him down into me and there is a little bit of a twisting motion you want to fall to the hip of the leg that's posting my left foot's posting so my left hip's going to land i said it's really important to sag your hips here guys because he has an opportunity to throw from his overhook so you have to sag your hips so he's going to send you he's going to give you some frequent flyer models sitting for a ride so i pull my grip in tight step sag my hips my hips are sagged he's not going to throw him okay sag pull turn and cover just so you know what you're avoiding in this position if alex has double overs for double unders rather and he gets perpendicular he steps here i have an opportunity or a few steps around to go to trip i have an opportunity to throw i can hook this leg and throw over top i can step deep um judo guys know too well all too well so there's a lot of throwing opportunity here hike this up see how his hips are close i can throw from here step throw now i can't do that alex's grip is low on my hip and his hips are low his hips are locked it's way harder to throw him so if he steps his foot behind my foot here and goes to stack his hips it's way harder to throw him i have to get my hips under his hips to throw effectively from here okay so just make sure you keep your hips low keep your hips low i have you overlooked keep your hips low post your foot right behind his heel sag and yank him back into you turn the car huh like i previously stated guys this is one of the most common positions you're going to end up in grappling but oddly enough we spend some of the least amount of time in our training in this position our emphasis is always on shooting or throws or uh fancy movements but this simple over under position is almost guaranteed whenever you take a shot if your partner stuffs the shot you're going to end up here half the time or or just from closing the distance in any manner you're going to end up chest to chest okay so dedicating a large portion of your training just to this singular position will greatly increase your chances of being successful in your takedowns you

takedowns to your back takes thus far we've been using the reach setup for all of our attacks i want to give you i want to add to that i want to add a drag series to your arsenal um hand fighting as a whole experienced grapplers know hand fighting is it's its own art form in itself it's uh it's it can get very complicated it takes a while to develop in the reach setup and this drag series is it's very accessible and it's also very high level you're going to see it in all levels of grappling so making this a big part of your game early on uh is a is a way that you can start getting involved in a hand fighting game without having to spend weeks and months engaging in the complex ins and outs that encompass full well-rounded hand fighting so take a look at all three setups that we have in this drag series see which one fits your style and personality the best and then get your reps in three separate ways to set up your drag the wrist grab drag snap drag and windmill drag each has their own benefit the simplest one the one you should start with is the same side wrist drag so i'm going to grab the same side wrist as my partner i'm going to drag inside up to the armpit pull and step what happens right after the other so i'm gonna grab up to the armpit and i'm gonna pull and step inside okay full step inside i never step outside at least if i'm setting up my shot i never step outside if i'm stepping outside he's just gonna circle his hips away okay and i'm gonna have to chase him all right cut the distance in half and step inside same side wrist pull up the armpit step across see how his body even turns away and he's perfectly set up for my double leg okay let's do our snap drag if your partner's reaching they don't even have to touch you if they do touch you you can do it or if it hands on the way you can do it but you see how his hand is pretty much ending up in the same position as my wrist grab so if he's posted all you have to do is snap drag same thing if it's on the way right if you can see that he has a tendency where he keeps posting he keeps posting you even catch it when it's on the way up so we're down here i see the wrist is coming step time it third is the windmill drag my personal favorite so again you can catch it on the way up or you could already be posted for simplicity's sake i'll have them already be posted i'm gonna win mill to the armpit my hand is coming inside right at the wrist i never grab his hand it just continues in motion straight across my midsection it continues in motion i never grab it my finger stays tight against my hand and then step inside your double head outside single or you can even take the back one more time the reason i prefer this is the wrist grab is going to develop your drag it's going to develop it from a very basic level because everything's stationary but the downfall of the wrist grab drag is that they can always have an idea of what's coming okay because this is controlled they know that an attack might be coming from here when you use motion to set up your drag when you use the snap or the windmill there's no pausing it's just the hand stays in motion so they have a little time to react okay so use your wrist grab just to set up your motion so you can get used to the drag and then start to prioritize the snap and windmill because they're um they're they're much higher percentage after our drag guys i'm just going to use the basic duck trip that we worked on in our previous video to finish from the back or drive straight through to a double those are your two options get a partner and start drilling if you don't have a partner you can still hit this in your stance in motion just imagine the reaction that you would need imagine your partner reaching their hand out to touch your shoulder and you intercepting the hand and hitting your drag okay so there's no reason not to get better we can still hit this in stance in motion even if we don't have a partner at hand

in we're going to introduce a new position the front headlock in every single wrestling match bjj match and in a lot of fights you're going to end up in the front headlock so having developed motion in this position through drills and having an idea of what you're aiming for is vitally important if you're going to be successful from your feet there's a lot of different ways you can end up in the front headlock position for simplicity's sake we're going to assume our partner takes a shot and we just have a good reaction we sprawl and we catch them here so alex takes a shot we sprawl and we catch them in a front headlock okay so a couple key points here let's back up a couple key points here you want your lead leg hand my lead leg is my right leg so my right hand is going to be cupping the chin right you know from our peek-out video that if i land with my hands over his ribs he has an opportunity to peek out okay so defensively when a guy shoots on you get in the habit of catching at the chin okay we want to we don't want to end up here but we're giving him offensive opportunities have your lead leg hand cup the chin if you were facing camera you can see that alex's chin is right in the palm of my hand my opposing hand my other hand is cupping right at his armpit i'm t-rexing my elbows pulling them nice and tight to my side i don't have my elbows long and accessible if they're accessible down here for alex and he starts grabbing at my hands and arms he's tying me up okay he's going to slow me at the very least he's going to slow me way down if not escape all together so i keep that from ever happening like keep my elbows nice and tight to my body pulling his chin tight and close pulling my left arm tight and close and my right shoulder is driving down where his neck meets his back i'm condensing space in between my hand and shoulder i keep everything tight i have a really good opportunity here to exhaust him to make him carry my weight okay so he's got to support all his weight and all of my weight and i'm supporting none okay so and they can support my weight now what do i want from here what's the advantage of being here i don't just hang out right because he's going to be trying to escape i want to advance my position the most one of the most advantageous positions you can be in is on someone's back okay you might be thinking if you're a bjj guy why i have a guillotine here i have darces why don't i just go for those you can you can uh but the theory being if i go for those if i go for these attacks and i don't get them right and i don't get them i end up on bottom right in a deficit i don't wanna i don't want my the possibility of my failed attempts to put me in a deficit okay so i wanna give you the option of taking the back from here just so you have it in your arsenal how do i do that i need to circle to his back why don't i just circle immediately because if i don't get him on his elbows if i don't get him with his weight facing forward he's just gonna snag my leg if i just circle from here he's just gonna snag my leg maybe even pull it in on a single and now we're in here wrestling and he has a chance to finish okay i'm gonna keep that from ever happening by snapping him down to his face you always want to snap him through the mat not to the mat i'm going to create a small separation between us just for a moment i'm going to go down to a knee just for a moment and pull him down in him see how he's on his elbows now he can't raise his hands up off the ground to catch me so i'm going to throw my chest high make him carry my weight the whole time pressure in pressure in and i snag his near side angle okay there's a lot of ways to finish from here you can just circle and take the back but a very detailed technical way to take the back is to turn his chin away as you circle so after i snapped throw my chest high turn his chin away i lace my forearm over top since his face is facing away he can't turn into me okay he's gonna go away his body goes so he no longer has the option to turn into me also as i'm circling if he's an experienced grappler he can start circling away so if i'm circling here you can start circling away circling away i'll never get to his back i keep that from happening by snagging his inside ankle okay now i've got this entire side of his body laced he can't turn into me and he can't circle away i've got him he's trapped once i've achieved this position i've essentially won now i'm going to bulldoze in with my chest hot i'm going to pull those in with my chest high and flare this ankle right i'm going to flare this ankle best case scenario i'm in side control now i can go to mouth worst case scenario you just take his [Music] back partner shoots you catch them at the chin and armpit you meet their pressure with your own pressure you push in you feel them push back you separate for a moment a little six inch separation with your shoulder small little six inch separation reverberate and pull them in watch my hips i'm going to snap him with my hips i'm not just pulling with my arms i pull and my hips come down the full weight of my body the full weight of my body is snapping and pulling him in now i throw my chest high the whole time i'm making carry my weight make him carry your weight place your forearm over top of his neck turn his chin away come up onto your feet slide the inside of your hand you don't need to use your thumb you're not grabbing his ankle you're hooking his ankle if you grab his ankle the position of your thumb is going to limit the depth of your hook so keep your thumb to the side of your hand and hook deep on his ankle here now he can't go anywhere now he's completely cased okay now i'm going to come up onto my feet bulldoze my chest you see how his hips start to go down to the ground immediately he starts to tilt and now he can't go anywhere he has to he has to abide by this pressure because i've got this entire side of his body cased he can't go so i push in and as i do i start to tilt my shoulders i start to tilt my shoulders and lift his ankle up and flare it to the side [Music] release you're in side control let's get right back down in that position let's say he's fighting me really hard okay very common you're not always going to be able to get that flare guys are going to be basing up they're going to be posting they're just going to have a stable base here so i'm not he's fighting me i'm not going to be able to lift at the very least guys the back take is right here it's right here just take his back it's actually it's actually your preference from here once you get here once you've achieved this position now you've got options you can go to flare or if you just want his back just take his back just keep your chin keep your chin hand keep his face turned away circle your hips behind his hips take his back one final note guys you might have to snap two three times before you get him on his head so if he's really strong has a really good base and he's refusing to go down you might have to snap snap snap before you can actually spin okay so once i'm in here make it a habit just to snap two or three times in your drilling okay so when you're drilling this have to be a good partner stay up on your hands okay so i'm gonna have to snap snap snap to fully get him to go down and collapse his hands now now i can spin and take his back okay um it's a very very aggressive movement uh it's not a kind position you want to be like a dog on a bone cupping the chin on the armpit and trying to put their face through the mat [Music]

'start': 395.6, 'duration': 3.36}]",i watch a lot of content online and i see basic problems with stances which is fine because you can always correct your stance i said this on a video i recorded recently about i went to college and the first thing our collegiate wrestling coaches did was tell us to get our stances we all got in our like funky stances like you know that worked in high school we were all like cool and my coach said you guys all suck and we were like what and he was like get in the stance and then we didn't realize we had all these problems our back foot was like this this is a really this is actually really common this is probably one of the hardest habits to break and it's because um this is just easier and more natural but a sprinter starts like this right so you want your toes all facing forward because this is where your power will come from so what i learned uh from my collegiate wrestling coaches was you don't want to be so low that it's easy to just pull my weight down okay and i don't want to be so tall that i just give it all up which is something that happens in jiu jitsu i understand because the throat's there so you want to be able to protect it so actually the best wrestling stance and the one that i learned in college is somewhere in between there if you watch any sport football baseball whatever you see this power position here right to catch the ball to come off the line whatever so if you're comfortable here you most people should be comfortable standing about right here okay that's when you put your hands out the front okay because your hands are your first line of defense then your head so in this case if a guy shooting on me my hands are low okay but my elbows are out the front okay so um there's all the iowa guys if you watch are in their their classically trained wrestlers are very good at they continue to pull their elbows in and they keep their arms out in front okay like this this is the best wrestling stance literally that you can have it allows for the most mobility for me to move around you can switch your feet up if you want but you always have to protect this lead leg okay none of this reaching like this this is just giving him everything okay and there's very few people who could wrestle like john smith who wrestled really really low okay and john smith was able but he still if you watch john you know he still played within this range really well and his hands were out for fun okay nobody's ever been like him ever again so for most of us mortals this is how you have to stand okay rest here okay so that this puts your back in a good position in a strong position and the hands come out in front okay i see plenty of people who are teaching wrestling who aren't wrestlers trained their jiu jitsu guys who who are shooting their back is straight but their hands are like this and then they're shooting and their hands are like this like anybody that knows anything can stuff you if their hands are out and in fact that's what you see if they're up against anybody who's any good they just can't get past their hands and they can't figure it out because your hands have to be out here if i want to be able to get his hands from dragging or posting any of those things but you notice how i never come up and out of a lot okay i'm not coming up and out when i post for example i'm staying here and when i get on that leg i'm never coming out of my stance when i run the double if i'm here in the bottom position and i come up to my feet when i get the hands off and i turn i'm never coming out of my position so you need to really work on this position being strong here and not coming out of it so if dumb one drill that you can do is just grab my head and this is really hard you can do this for a few minutes and just try to yank me out of my stance and just really stay here like this and you're gonna you're gonna you know there's going to be times when you come out of your stance a little bit but the purpose is he's really really really strong really strong so when he's pulling me around what i'm trying to prevent myself from doing is breaking protocol like and trying to come up and out because oh my back is tired or all my legs are tired like you should be able to stay in a stance and move around by yourself you know and move for six seven minutes seven if it's college most you guys probably are watching this if you're a collegiate wrestler six minutes if you're in high school and stay here okay you should be able to stay here your weight should be more on your balls to your feet but not so much that you fall over but if you're if your butt's under you okay then this is a strong positioning okay it doesn't have to be fancy you don't need something cool you know and everybody takes their high school wrestling photos no you know weird stances like this should be your high school wrestling photo right here oh man it looks so 1960s well they figured stuff out this is the best stance you can't get past my hands you have to do a lot of work and then if you do get my hands out of the way my head's the next line of defense once you get here i'm in trouble okay and and again you don't need to come out of your stance if somebody gets up on my hips i want to be able to control it for the power position here okay so work on that work on staying tough stay in here this is fundamental if you're winning a match and somebody's coming at you like a honey badger you have to be able to maintain good proper space if you're in good stance and they're coming out of their states trying so hard you might get some easy shots you might get some easy posts okay because you're being fundamentally sound if you can't stay in your stance when you're tired you need to work on that like that is fundamental stance is number one even when i went to d1 the first thing they did was have us get into our stance if you can't do this you can't wrestle not at a high level okay so because what you don't want to do is having people on you and so much more work for me to get them off my legs okay so we're here we're gonna stay here okay so get used to walking around i used to walk around my house like this in high school so uh let me know what you think um if you have any specific comments about like and subscribe and uh we can continue to post comments or content on this thanks

so if he's coming at me like a honey badger that's different okay so it's like because he's going to be all tight and everything and i didn't get a chance to get under but if we were just doing your typical wrestling we're trying to feel each other out and stuff if he's pushing me watching my feet here most people they take a big step to stop him okay and so if if he's pushing me watch my feet again and so he's pushing me and i have to stop him that's where he's that's when he you'll get better at feeling this but when when he's backing up back up he takes that step that's when you are anticipating he's going to push back and that's where all your classic shots come from and everything so if i want a high quality for example and i'm pushing him back and then he takes this big step okay that's when i disappear that's when he falls over me okay and he's gonna fall over because his weight was already transferred that way so and and it's gonna you're gonna have to practice all your shots knowing full well that in order and you're gonna be circling it's not gonna be linear like this you're gonna be all over the place but but if i'm here this way let's see watch he just doesn't snap down again when i push when he pushes into me and i take this big step that's when mom's off balance right and that's when he can really take advantage of that of that off balance so if he's not engaging with you we'll cover that uh in the next in the next video um that's a whole different thing because in wrestling don't worry about it because if he's not engaging with you he's going to get him for stalling over and over again it is common though in jiu jitsu and i'll talk about two different takedowns that i think will really help you with that but as a general rule though even if i want an outside shot right like an outside signal i have to get them to stop me and commit to pushing me because what's going to happen is i'm going to disappear under you right so if i pull in for example um so if i get him and i pull this right foot right it was because when i was pushing him and he stopped me right i pulled that that foot came forward and i was able to get to it okay um if he's really he's good about hiding his back leg because he sees that my right leg is forward so he never wants me to have that leg so it's not an option for me okay you can't be so hung up on i want that leg because i want to shoot an outside single dude if it's not there you can't do it he never gives it to me so so like if i'm here and i'm trying to pull that right leg forward he makes it really hard for it to get close so i'm going to probably have to push him and stop just going to this one because it's closer okay but notice it looks like i'm taking a huge penetration step and then and i kind of like i mean i am moving forward but it's mostly that when i'm stopping him but when he's stopping me that is keep pushing me that i'm disappearing see how i let go of him when he flew over me okay and that that's where my now you know if i don't clear his body because he's a good wrestler and i go to take a shot and he touches me with his chest then he's just gonna stop me see like that so yes i do have to lower my level and get up underneath him right but this is wrestling he doesn't have to give it to me in fact he shouldn't i want it because it gives you but i can tell you one thing if he's backing up and he doesn't push back to me it's gonna be bad because what's gonna happen is if he's put i push it back in and he's and he's just stalling if i take the shot i'm gonna be too far away and he can just stuff me you know and then like nowadays you know i just made my life so if you can't get him to commit to stop you don't take a shot okay i have to get him to commit to stop me and my first move and just like he did my first move is i didn't stop me and then as soon as he stops me i'm snapping the head will he always go down no but when i pull his head down and i let go his head comes up so i pulled it down and he's pulling his head back up that's what i'm coming under okay and again this works for every shot double leg outside single everything you can't expect him you know you need to just if if he's aggressive he's pushing anything good but you can't take a shot without having the good inside control because if he's got inside control and he's dominating all this aggressive movement i can't take a shot here it'll never work right so you can't be so anxious to get on a shot that you don't have the proper setup so in here that's all we're focusing on proper setup is watch his feet and if he takes it commits to that that step and infeed had obvious okay i'm doing it for the camera but that big step you anticipate that it's going to happen when you get better you'll feel their hips tilting okay but in the beginning watch their feet you have a clear view of them and so he's watching me right now he's pushing me and i take a step that's when he's going to snap me looks so powerful that he just looks so horrible right and all that momentum spinning behind chopping arm like so that's coming off with my energy pushing back into them and everything judo any jiu-jitsu moves that you do if your arm dragging from the sitting position here you know if you've ever done this and you just like telegraph it you try to pull somebody's arms you can just posture up and it doesn't work you know you have to commit to pushing into them so that they push back for it to look okay so that create the motion first when they react and so you're in the driver's seat of creating all that motion
