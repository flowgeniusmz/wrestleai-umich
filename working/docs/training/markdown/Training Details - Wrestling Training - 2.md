| 0.06 | 6.84 | 6.90 | okay next we are going to talk about |
| 2.73 | 7.28 | 10.01 | motion now your motion is also very |
| 6.90 | 6.45 | 13.35 | personal too so keep in mind that we"re |
| 10.01 | 5.11 | 15.12 | we"re talking to audits of your starting |
| 13.35 | 5.01 | 18.36 | program you"re just training one of your |
| 15.12 | 7.41 | 22.53 | athletes make sure that you take into |
| 18.36 | 6.03 | 24.39 | account their personality their athletic |
| 22.53 | 5.28 | 27.81 | ability right because one of the worst |
| 24.39 | 6.90 | 31.29 | things that you can do is bestow stance |
| 27.81 | 6.30 | 34.11 | or emotion upon someone that really |
| 31.29 | 5.58 | 36.87 | doesn"t fit right so there"s no way we |
| 34.11 | 5.07 | 39.18 | can take Tom brands and put them in John |
| 36.87 | 4.68 | 41.55 | Smith"s stance there"s no way that we |
| 39.18 | 4.41 | 43.59 | could take a Kyle Schneider and put them |
| 41.55 | 4.02 | 45.57 | in Jordan Oliver Stan"s it just it |
| 43.59 | 3.63 | 47.22 | wouldn"t work not just because of body |
| 45.57 | 4.29 | 49.86 | type but also because of personality |
| 47.22 | 4.95 | 52.17 | right so what I want you to do is think |
| 49.86 | 3.66 | 53.52 | about your motion and what you want to |
| 52.17 | 3.75 | 55.92 | accomplish all right let"s get into a |
| 53.52 | 6.06 | 59.58 | square stance here first okay squirt |
| 55.92 | 7.74 | 63.66 | let"s face it okay so what you"re gonna |
| 59.58 | 6.75 | 66.33 | do this is the best way to circle an |
| 63.66 | 3.93 | 67.59 | approach okay so let"s circle first so |
| 66.33 | 6.48 | 72.81 | he"s going to go right left right left |
| 67.59 | 8.31 | 75.90 | okay the feet never go closer than |
| 72.81 | 4.65 | 77.46 | hip-width and never go further than |
| 75.90 | 4.41 | 80.31 | shoulder width so that leaves us with |
| 77.46 | 4.14 | 81.60 | short choppy little steps like this you |
| 80.31 | 4.38 | 84.69 | would slide the head back to Mission |
| 81.60 | 5.46 | 87.06 | good and come back that"s perfect now |
| 84.69 | 4.41 | 89.10 | what what you hear a lot of coaches |
| 87.06 | 3.69 | 90.75 | saying never cross your feet never cross |
| 89.10 | 4.53 | 93.63 | your feet and that is a good rule of |
| 90.75 | 4.83 | 95.58 | thumb truth be told |
| 93.63 | 6.03 | 99.66 | rules are very much going to be broken |
| 95.58 | 6.27 | 101.85 | so as you get a more success in the |
| 99.66 | 4.50 | 104.16 | sport you"re gonna see guys that kind of |
| 101.85 | 4.65 | 106.50 | take their time and cross their feet up |
| 104.16 | 5.10 | 109.26 | a little bit but yeah for the most part |
| 106.50 | 6.99 | 113.49 | you don"t want your guys crossing their |
| 109.26 | 5.85 | 115.11 | feet particularly in this square stance |
| 113.49 | 4.53 | 118.02 | so if you cross his feet in a square |
| 115.11 | 4.98 | 120.09 | stance that"s a very easy turning right |
| 118.02 | 2.46 | 120.48 | I wouldn"t take a whole lot to knock him |
| 120.09 | 2.97 | 123.06 | over |
| 120.48 | 3.02 | 123.50 | however if he had a hard left he stands |
| 123.06 | 3.38 | 126.44 | right |
| 123.50 | 4.86 | 128.36 | language okay now if he crosses his feet |
| 126.44 | 4.23 | 130.67 | just a little bit he"s still pretty |
| 128.36 | 6.21 | 134.57 | mobile and he can still kind of defend |
| 130.67 | 7.59 | 138.26 | okay now if you are getting that square |
| 134.57 | 6.06 | 140.63 | stance please okay if you are not the |
| 138.26 | 6.00 | 144.26 | most athletic guy in the world okay |
| 140.63 | 6.51 | 147.14 | making contact with a square stance is |
| 144.26 | 5.97 | 150.23 | usually best so if you"re facing me okay |
| 147.14 | 4.47 | 151.61 | I"m going to square stance the way that |
| 150.23 | 4.35 | 154.58 | I make contact |
| 151.61 | 5.40 | 157.01 | okay it"s very very safe and very very |
| 154.58 | 4.41 | 158.99 | calculated right so I"ll kind of almost |
| 157.01 | 4.26 | 161.27 | like a third baseman coming in on but |
| 158.99 | 4.17 | 163.16 | I"ll keep my hands down until my head |
| 161.27 | 5.66 | 166.93 | makes contact and his hands the lobby |
| 163.16 | 6.81 | 169.97 | now I can use my hands okay so I"m |
| 166.93 | 5.38 | 172.31 | approaching with my hands down so that |
| 169.97 | 5.61 | 175.58 | he can"t attack my legs and I"m making |
| 172.31 | 6.54 | 178.85 | contact with my head first okay that"s |
| 175.58 | 5.67 | 181.25 | our stocking or pursuing motion right |
| 178.85 | 4.68 | 183.53 | now if you want to kind of retreat |
| 181.25 | 4.89 | 186.14 | understand something that you"re still |
| 183.53 | 4.74 | 188.27 | in a good sweared stance to retreats up |
| 186.14 | 5.07 | 191.21 | he"s coming at me I can kind of keep my |
| 188.27 | 4.02 | 192.29 | hands down and able to block with my |
| 191.21 | 5.15 | 196.36 | head okay |
| 192.29 | 7.17 | 199.46 | your motion in a staggered stance |
| 196.36 | 6.10 | 202.46 | becomes extremely important as well like |
| 199.46 | 5.60 | 205.06 | I said you can theoretically cross your |
| 202.46 | 4.74 | 207.20 | feet up a little bit more in your |
| 205.06 | 5.29 | 210.35 | staggered stance tucking a staggered |
| 207.20 | 6.06 | 213.26 | stance okay his hands are still out in |
| 210.35 | 5.61 | 215.96 | front of them right but now he has the |
| 213.26 | 4.80 | 218.06 | ability to go left right and forth |
| 215.96 | 4.26 | 220.22 | so now the forward becomes extremely |
| 218.06 | 5.67 | 223.73 | important one of these you find in a |
| 220.22 | 7.08 | 227.30 | square stance is I can generate a lot of |
| 223.73 | 6.12 | 229.85 | power with my back leg right so some of |
| 227.30 | 5.31 | 232.61 | the best in the world can do this with |
| 229.85 | 5.61 | 235.46 | both legs but if you"re just starting |
| 232.61 | 6.18 | 238.79 | out you"re just training brandy wrestles |
| 235.46 | 5.58 | 241.04 | you want to explain to them that most of |
| 238.79 | 5.16 | 243.95 | their power is going to come from their |
| 241.04 | 6.48 | 247.52 | back legs so when we use our motion in |
| 243.95 | 5.43 | 249.38 | our stance we have to make sure that we |
| 247.52 | 4.89 | 252.41 | load up our |
| 249.38 | 6.99 | 256.37 | leg right so it"s not just here okay |
| 252.41 | 5.88 | 258.29 | I"ll move I"m stepping so that I load my |
| 256.37 | 4.11 | 260.48 | back leg right so I"m not stepping back |
| 258.29 | 5.22 | 263.51 | here where I don"t get much much push |
| 260.48 | 5.73 | 266.21 | I"m setting it up here so I can drive |
| 263.51 | 4.32 | 267.83 | often so keep that MOT so now I"m |
| 266.21 | 4.80 | 271.01 | getting that squares in look at motion |
| 267.83 | 4.62 | 272.45 | side side good now switch to a staggered |
| 271.01 | 3.27 | 274.28 | stance please good |
| 272.45 | 4.74 | 277.19 | let"s get motion side to side you get |
| 274.28 | 5.22 | 279.50 | ready to penetrate good there you go |
| 277.19 | 7.04 | 284.23 | so you"re seeing him level change and |
| 279.50 | 4.73 | 284.23 | load his legs up right so it"s here |
