| 22.44 | 4.52 | 26.96 | my head and I Circle away that"s the |
| 24.60 | 4.00 | 28.60 | first line of defense and a good way to |
| 26.96 | 4.60 | 31.56 | drill that take your hands out of the |

| 77.76 | 3.44 | 81.20 | there we"re going to go to our third |
| 79.44 | 4.00 | 83.44 | line of defense which is going to be |
| 81.20 | 4.24 | 85.44 | your forearms or your billy clubs what"s |
| 83.44 | 4.20 | 87.64 | going to happen is if he gets past your |
| 85.44 | 4.64 | 90.08 | first second line you"re going to have |
| 87.64 | 4.84 | 92.48 | to use your forearm to block him back so |
| 90.08 | 4.96 | 95.04 | if he takes the shot and he blocks my |
| 92.48 | 4.88 | 97.36 | hands the next line has to be my |
| 95.04 | 5.00 | 100.04 | forearms once I get my forearms I get my |

| 100.04 | 4.04 | 104.08 | first line of defense got his head back |
| 102.00 | 4.12 | 106.12 | right in position so once again if he |
| 104.08 | 5.04 | 109.12 | gets past my hand I got to use my |
| 106.12 | 4.88 | 111.00 | forearms to block him after that I can |
| 109.12 | 3.52 | 112.64 | push him back off and I"m recovering my |
