| 22.88 | 3.36 | 26.24 | just stand relaxed try not to think |
| 24.40 | 2.72 | 27.12 | about anything and have someone push you |
| 26.24 | 2.48 | 28.72 | from behind |
| 27.12 | 4.08 | 31.20 | whatever leg steps forward that"s your |
| 28.72 | 3.92 | 32.64 | lead leg and wherever you step |

| 32.64 | 2.72 | 35.36 | your lead leg to sit now let"s talk |
| 34.40 | 3.04 | 37.44 | about hip level |
| 35.36 | 3.52 | 38.88 | you want your hips low as low as your |
| 37.44 | 2.64 | 40.08 | anatomy allows if you"re an older |
| 38.88 | 3.20 | 42.08 | student you have bad knees |
| 40.08 | 3.20 | 43.28 | you might not be able to get too low |
| 42.08 | 3.04 | 45.12 | just get as low |
| 43.28 | 4.00 | 47.28 | as you can you don"t want to be standing |
| 45.12 | 4.48 | 49.60 | straight up you want to have some hinge |
| 47.28 | 3.04 | 50.32 | in your hips with your chest treading |
| 49.60 | 3.68 | 53.28 | floating |
| 50.32 | 3.60 | 53.92 | over your lead leg knee okay and i |
| 53.28 | 2.40 | 55.68 | always |
| 53.92 | 3.20 | 57.12 | keep a straight back i don"t want any |
| 55.68 | 2.32 | 58.00 | roundness in my back i don"t want my |
| 57.12 | 2.88 | 60.00 | head going low |
| 58.00 | 4.16 | 62.16 | i want a nice straight back with my head |
| 60.00 | 4.64 | 64.64 | up let"s talk about hand placement |
| 62.16 | 4.16 | 66.32 | where do i want my hands iowa style |
| 64.64 | 4.40 | 69.04 | there"s two main |
| 66.32 | 3.92 | 70.24 | options for your hands iowa style which |
| 69.04 | 3.68 | 72.72 | is a strict |
| 70.24 | 4.40 | 74.64 | defensive hand over my lead leg my lead |
| 72.72 | 3.92 | 76.64 | leg"s going to be closest to my opponent |
| 74.64 | 4.32 | 78.96 | so the thought being i am going to want |
| 76.64 | 4.24 | 80.88 | to prioritizing protecting this |
| 78.96 | 3.84 | 82.80 | leg keeping a hand nice and disciplined |
| 80.88 | 4.32 | 85.20 | over top of it my attack hand |
| 82.80 | 3.20 | 86.00 | my backhand making contact first or the |
| 85.20 | 2.64 | 87.84 | oklahoma state |
| 86.00 | 3.84 | 89.84 | style stance with your elbow sort of |
| 87.84 | 3.12 | 90.96 | t-rex pulled to your arms ready to jut |
| 89.84 | 3.60 | 93.44 | out and attack |
| 90.96 | 4.16 | 95.12 | creating motion from here all the while |
| 93.44 | 4.16 | 97.60 | guys i"m never tense |
| 95.12 | 3.36 | 98.48 | i"m never tense here i maintain good |
| 97.60 | 2.96 | 100.56 | position |
| 98.48 | 3.76 | 102.24 | but i"m nice and loose and relaxed a lot |
| 100.56 | 3.76 | 104.32 | of times you"ll see wrestlers |
| 102.24 | 3.28 | 105.52 | do this kind of stuff or they let their |
| 104.32 | 3.20 | 107.52 | arms jig out or |
| 105.52 | 3.36 | 108.88 | stutter step they"re just reminding |
| 107.52 | 3.60 | 111.12 | themselves to stay relaxed |
| 108.88 | 3.76 | 112.64 | they"re just taking a small break here |
| 111.12 | 4.72 | 115.84 | creating some fluid motion |
| 112.64 | 6.16 | 118.80 | okay so our hip level is low |
| 115.84 | 4.48 | 120.32 | but not so low that we"re past parallel |
| 118.80 | 5.20 | 124.00 | with our femur to the mat |
| 120.32 | 5.84 | 126.16 | okay our arms are either io style |
| 124.00 | 3.92 | 127.92 | defensively out in front we call this |
| 126.16 | 2.56 | 128.72 | our shield hand and our attack or our |
| 127.92 | 3.92 | 131.84 | sword hand |
| 128.72 | 6.88 | 135.60 | or oklahoma state style with our elbows |
| 131.84 | 5.76 | 137.60 | pulled in tight to our sides here okay |
| 135.60 | 3.12 | 138.72 | now when we"re creating the motion that |
| 137.60 | 3.76 | 141.36 | we want in our stance |
| 138.72 | 4.32 | 143.04 | whatever way you"re going that"s the leg |
| 141.36 | 2.40 | 143.76 | that"s going to lead so if i"m moving |
| 143.04 | 3.92 | 146.96 | forward |
| 143.76 | 6.32 | 150.08 | my lead leg leads the movement |
| 146.96 | 10.00 | 156.96 | if i"m going backwards you guessed it my |
| 150.08 | 9.60 | 159.68 | back leg leads the movement |
| 156.96 | 2.72 | 159.68 | and circling |
| 160.64 | 6.72 | 167.36 | whichever way i circle leads |
| 164.16 | 5.60 | 169.76 | the movement and i"m never over stepping |
| 167.36 | 3.28 | 170.64 | i always want to achieve short choppy |
| 169.76 | 4.72 | 174.48 | steps |
| 170.64 | 6.96 | 177.60 | i"m never going too wide okay |
| 174.48 | 7.12 | 181.60 | i want to have short |
| 177.60 | 6.32 | 183.92 | fast choppy steps always keeping my feet |
| 181.60 | 3.04 | 184.64 | under me so there i have an increased |
| 183.92 | 2.72 | 186.64 | ability |
| 184.64 | 3.12 | 187.76 | to attack so if you want to learn |
| 186.64 | 1.76 | 188.40 | wrestling one of the first things you |
| 187.76 | 2.40 | 190.16 | have to do |
| 188.40 | 3.12 | 191.52 | is condition your legs you have to be |
| 190.16 | 2.16 | 192.32 | able to move through all of these ranges |
| 191.52 | 3.76 | 195.28 | of motion |
| 192.32 | 4.16 | 196.48 | without coming out of your stance the |
| 195.28 | 2.48 | 197.76 | moment you come out of position you |
| 196.48 | 2.16 | 198.64 | leave yourself vulnerable for a leg |
| 197.76 | 2.56 | 200.32 | attack and also |
| 198.64 | 3.84 | 202.48 | you"re not in position then to attack |
| 200.32 | 3.68 | 204.00 | their legs so start a timer |
| 202.48 | 3.44 | 205.92 | and go through all of these ranges of |
| 204.00 | 3.60 | 207.60 | motion for as long as you can |
| 205.92 | 3.12 | 209.04 | and then when you absolutely can"t take |
| 207.60 | 2.00 | 209.60 | it anymore your legs are on fire they"re |
| 209.04 | 3.76 | 212.80 | burning |
| 209.60 | 4.24 | 213.84 | wait five more seconds and come out of |
| 212.80 | 3.28 | 216.08 | your stance |
| 213.84 | 3.44 | 217.28 | go and check your timer rest let your |
| 216.08 | 3.60 | 219.68 | body recover |
| 217.28 | 3.04 | 220.32 | then repeat that process three more |
| 219.68 | 2.80 | 222.48 | times |
| 220.32 | 4.00 | 224.32 | all in your staggered stance repeat this |
| 222.48 | 3.76 | 226.24 | process for a week or two |
