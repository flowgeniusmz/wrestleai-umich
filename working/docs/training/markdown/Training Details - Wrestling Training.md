| 1.38 | 3.87 | 5.25 | gonna work on our top series we"re gonna |
| 3.27 | 4.41 | 7.68 | show a really basic fundamentals on |
| 5.25 | 4.80 | 10.05 | chopping somebody down we"re gonna go |
| 7.68 | 3.90 | 11.58 | over half ring over bar and wrist and |
| 10.05 | 4.10 | 14.15 | then we"re gonna put a whole series |
| 11.58 | 6.14 | 17.72 | together you know put it all together |
| 14.15 | 6.94 | 21.09 | also we"re gonna go a cradle series |
| 17.72 | 5.83 | 23.55 | small easy fundamental pushing shoulder |
| 21.09 | 5.39 | 26.48 | up cradle the defendant cradle what we |
| 23.55 | 4.95 | 28.50 | do next so first one we"re gonna go over |
| 26.48 | 3.64 | 30.12 | there"s gonna be on top we"re gonna go |
| 28.50 | 4.65 | 33.15 | to break him down |
| 30.12 | 5.58 | 35.70 | we have to go tight waist right here |
| 33.15 | 5.82 | 38.97 | we"re gonna chop and drive them forward |
| 35.70 | 6.90 | 42.60 | good and our goal is once we chop him |
| 38.97 | 6.39 | 45.36 | down we have to put all our weight we"re |
| 42.60 | 5.28 | 47.88 | on our toes and we"re driving into them |
| 45.36 | 5.76 | 51.12 | to keep them flat a lot we don"t want to |
| 47.88 | 9.27 | 57.15 | do this come back up is when we chop him |
| 51.12 | 9.96 | 61.08 | down all the way down is that we keep |
| 57.15 | 5.55 | 62.70 | our knees up here and we release |
| 61.08 | 3.99 | 65.07 | pressure this guy"s gonna build the base |
| 62.70 | 7.02 | 69.72 | yep so what we want to do this is so |
| 65.07 | 7.65 | 72.72 | important as we chop him down push that |
| 69.72 | 4.92 | 74.64 | into him good and we keep waiting |
| 72.72 | 8.13 | 80.85 | the first thing where I look for us is a |
| 74.64 | 8.01 | 82.65 | half when I bring our half here now |
| 80.85 | 3.30 | 84.15 | here"s what"s really really important |
| 82.65 | 5.25 | 87.90 | and I"m walking him through this as well |
| 84.15 | 7.47 | 91.62 | is that we use our pinky first here we |
| 87.90 | 6.29 | 94.19 | come here and then we run around all |
| 91.62 | 10.62 | 102.24 | right one more time |
| 94.19 | 9.22 | 103.41 | chop him down he brings his hands out so |
| 102.24 | 6.33 | 108.57 | you spent a lot of weight it"s hard for |
| 103.41 | 8.67 | 112.08 | me get out bring that hand up pinky half |
| 108.57 | 5.79 | 114.36 | now on this side we"re gonna keep it |
| 112.08 | 4.59 | 116.67 | just go straight over basic half we"re |
| 114.36 | 4.47 | 118.83 | gonna kick them over one big thing good |
| 116.67 | 6.02 | 122.69 | we"re on our toes we"re lifting his head |
| 118.83 | 3.86 | 122.69 | up it was all the time |
| 127.37 | 8.32 | 135.69 | go ahead chopping down punch the hand |
| 132.90 | 5.19 | 138.09 | through pinky here |
| 135.69 | 4.56 | 140.25 | drive off all right when we get to this |
| 138.09 | 5.34 | 143.43 | positions it"s really important that we |
| 140.25 | 5.85 | 146.10 | punched down blood punch his head and |
| 143.43 | 4.61 | 148.04 | then we have to realign our chest we got |
| 146.10 | 5.01 | 151.11 | to drop it back and then push them over |
| 148.04 | 7.45 | 155.49 | right here on our toes looking at the |
| 151.11 | 8.49 | 159.60 | ceiling good okay now I want you to do a |
| 155.49 | 6.89 | 162.38 | video as you can run the half and the |
| 159.60 | 10.10 | 169.70 | wrist so here"s another way of using |
| 162.38 | 7.32 | 169.70 | isolating both sides chop across forward |
| 173.27 | 8.76 | 182.03 | okay once you got that we set our hips |
| 180.00 | 24.60 | 204.60 | you take them straight down and over I |
| 182.03 | 25.54 | 207.57 | get a warrant our last one here alright |
| 204.60 | 4.44 | 209.04 | so that"s a half series there the next |
| 207.57 | 6.18 | 213.75 | thing I want him to work on is a bit uh |
| 209.04 | 7.92 | 216.96 | something very common it"s a bar also |
| 213.75 | 8.91 | 222.66 | known as a chicken wing and a wrist so |
| 216.96 | 7.26 | 224.22 | chop them down good grab the bar it"s |
| 222.66 | 3.69 | 226.35 | important that you grab some bar here |
| 224.22 | 4.95 | 229.17 | you"re gonna punch that hang in grab the |
| 226.35 | 5.94 | 232.29 | wrist now here"s the difference between |
| 229.17 | 6.09 | 235.26 | what what I want him to do is I want to |
| 232.29 | 6.56 | 238.85 | make sure that his elbow is on this on |
| 235.26 | 7.52 | 242.78 | your chest there you go run it |
| 238.85 | 21.18 | 260.03 | take it all the way over and come around |
| 242.78 | 20.61 | 263.39 | again chop him down grab the bar there |
| 260.03 | 6.12 | 266.15 | we go run it run it run it |
| 263.39 | 5.99 | 269.38 | bring his shoulder to his ears as you |
| 266.15 | 3.23 | 269.38 | take them all the way over |
| 276.17 | 2.06 | 278.23 | you |
