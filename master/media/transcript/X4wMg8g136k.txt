to see Taylor rally and then in the world championships last year in Oslo it was a strong second period from yazdani that propelled him to the world title and here we go so you got to know that these guys have the best technique in the world this is a Clash of Titans but the pressure and the nerves how do you deal with that that has to play a big part the build up is so big we could feel it in the arena all day imagine being one of these guys right into the action heavy hand fighting yazdani with this constant pressure forward David Taylor with his Lefty collar tie looking for ankle picks and far across single legs this will be non-stop action non-stop action both guys looking to score not looking to gain the edge than that David Taylor will be looking to get on the legs as will yazdani David Taylor he's the winning if yazdani gets on his legs out scramble him this is one of the positions where he got yazdani tired and that first match we were talking about earlier and if David Taylor can finish his own leg attacks that's going to be the key for him winning yeah Donnie shut David Taylor down close space keep pressure shut him down frustrate him and get on his legs later in the match we will get our first whistle a little more than a minute in after his World Championship win against Taylor he was reached out to by everyone back in his homeland from film stars to politicians everybody wanted to congratulate him he is beloved by the people of Iran a hero an icon and we have another stop each and it will be Taylor on the activity clock not quite halfway through period number one a shot attempt by David Taylor at Cross single leg I was talking about but he gets pulled into the front headlock five Hassan yasdani looking to wear on him here a little bit not so much looking to score killing time in the activity period 16 seconds left before David Taylor gives up a point yeah now David Taylor would love to score while he's on this activity clock but it's not the most important it's more about setting things up and for later in the match we will get one point back eventually is what David Taylor's thinking because he doesn't want to over exert himself and give up a quick takedown just because he wants to get that point he's on the activity five first period there's four minutes left in the match a lot of time left 1-0 yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] Lefty College being very effective for David Taylor you can see him shoving with his forearm but then pulling down very heavily that wears on his opponent his opponent is very used to being tired and very used to putting his own pressure on people as he does with this underhook close to stepping out but no step out what a great action as David Taylor looks to re-attack has his hand on the leg one more tough single leg finished clean clean single leg a lot of action as you can see that's what it takes at this level it took a minute and a half of both guys really attempting scoring attacks David Taylor comes out on top of the takedown two to one over hassania's Dani 14 seconds left in the first period [Music] fingers final few moments of this opening period Taylor of the United States will go into the break on top two to one your score Taylor with a late takedown in the first period okay let's talk adjustments if any and observations through the first three minutes starting with Taylor in the American corner I don't know I'm a fan right now but these guys are going at it I I want to know what they're talking about what they're thinking in their head but they're thinking offense I gotta get back to that single leg yazdani's thinking get him to the edge but start it a little bit outside of the center so he can get the push out as you saw David Taylor kind of tiptoed the edge that was crucial in not scoring the point and it started that first three attack which ended up in a single leg there's a lot of stuff going on guys just just grab the popcorn and watch since 2017 David Taylor is 77-39 of those Tech faults that's how dominant he has been both have won Olympic Golds both are world champions key scramble early on in this period and they go back to the feet yazdani keeps the pressure a couple of jabs back and forth hands getting up heavy collar tie there from yazdani and Taylor asked for time as a finger got up in the right eye of the Olympic gold medalist when the match said Hassan yostani won he beat him and got David Taylor very tired in that front headlock position so it was nice to see David Taylor wrestle out of that instead of hanging in there but one thing I haven't seen much from Hassan yasdani his stance is getting a little bit higher which means that the collar tie of David Taylor we were talking about in the first period is wearing on taking a little bit of a toll taking a little bit of a toll which is going to open up some opportunities for attacks now I'm not sure the strategy that David Taylor has but the option is starting to get a little bit more available to shoot those single legs and Advance on this lead as yastani gets to his underhook that's his best position Nice Shot attempt and finished once again yeah Donnie trying to push him to the edge but David Taylor tiptoes the line and instead of just circling out he's right back on his offense in a critical time and this is the the part that Taylor has really worked on over the past 12 months is partner unable to get any type of turn there but twice now in this second period he has opened up a three-point lead couple of takedowns by Taylor and right back in beating him on the inside with that left hand is really critical another single leg as a counter looking for the push-up there's a lot of wrestling left we've seen comebacks happen at at the highest stage between these two so we gotta keep paying attention to those ties and holding our ground and yazdani has to get to that underhook and then that's going to make it possible for him to get to his attacks Yeah you mentioned it the history with these two it's been decided in the final 30 seconds so many times with them Taylor with the 5-1 lead yazdani switching back and forth nearly had Taylor exposed still no points awarded yet scramble continues yes Dani coming through the crotch trying to get a crotch Lift near the edge Taylor still trying to stay anchored down inside a minute to go yazdani will thrust up one more time and Taylor breaks it and we go back to the feet with 49 seconds to go wow wow amazing wrestling I thought yazdani had him dead to rights he was in the butt drag position almost fully behind him and David Taylor did some magic man type stuff now you see me now you don't [Music] [Applause] pressure is wearing on David Taylor this is the position that he beat him in but he's still looking to score and what an amazing job holding Poise in the front headlock you know that he's exhausted this match has been the highest Pace out of anything I've seen all tournament and still looking to score in one of yazdani's best positions seven to one 29 seconds left foreign takedowns [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] his largest lead as we wind down the clock yazdani he's worked from this front headlock position trying to get one final thrust it's not going to happen and the United States of America is back on top of the world here in Belgrade David Taylor now a two-time world champion [Applause] [Music] [Applause] seven one seven two one counter-attacks and guys I want to talk about the most crucial moment he's up five to one Taylor's up five to one because Donnie is 99 of the way around him we talk about doing one more position [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Olympic title right into the world champion ships it's such a hard
