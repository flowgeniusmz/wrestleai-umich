| 0.40 | 3.28 | 3.68 | i want to give you guys one more setup |
| 1.76 | 3.36 | 5.12 | to your takedowns to your back takes |
| 3.68 | 3.28 | 6.96 | thus far we"ve been using the reach |
| 5.12 | 3.44 | 8.56 | setup for all of our attacks |
| 6.96 | 3.76 | 10.72 | i want to give you i want to add to that |
| 8.56 | 4.64 | 13.20 | i want to add a drag series |
| 10.72 | 3.12 | 13.84 | to your arsenal um hand fighting as a |
| 13.20 | 2.72 | 15.92 | whole |
| 13.84 | 4.56 | 18.40 | experienced grapplers know hand fighting |
| 15.92 | 3.04 | 18.96 | is it"s its own art form in itself it"s |
| 18.40 | 2.56 | 20.96 | uh |
| 18.96 | 3.52 | 22.48 | it"s it can get very complicated it |
| 20.96 | 4.56 | 25.52 | takes a while to develop |
| 22.48 | 4.96 | 27.44 | in the reach setup and this drag series |
| 25.52 | 3.12 | 28.64 | is it"s very accessible and it"s also |
| 27.44 | 2.72 | 30.16 | very high level you"re going to see it |
| 28.64 | 3.28 | 31.92 | in all levels of grappling |
| 30.16 | 3.28 | 33.44 | so making this a big part of your game |
| 31.92 | 3.92 | 35.84 | early on uh |
| 33.44 | 4.32 | 37.76 | is a is a way that you can start getting |
| 35.84 | 2.80 | 38.64 | involved in a hand fighting game without |
| 37.76 | 4.24 | 42.00 | having to spend |
| 38.64 | 6.08 | 44.72 | weeks and months engaging in the complex |
| 42.00 | 4.16 | 46.16 | ins and outs that encompass full |
| 44.72 | 3.12 | 47.84 | well-rounded hand fighting |
| 46.16 | 3.20 | 49.36 | so take a look at all three setups that |
| 47.84 | 3.04 | 50.88 | we have in this drag series |
| 49.36 | 3.44 | 52.80 | see which one fits your style and |
| 50.88 | 3.28 | 54.16 | personality the best and then get your |
| 52.80 | 3.04 | 55.84 | reps in |
| 54.16 | 3.04 | 57.20 | three separate ways to set up your drag |
| 55.84 | 3.44 | 59.28 | the wrist grab drag |
| 57.20 | 3.60 | 60.80 | snap drag and windmill drag each has |
| 59.28 | 3.20 | 62.48 | their own benefit |
| 60.80 | 3.44 | 64.24 | the simplest one the one you should |
| 62.48 | 3.28 | 65.76 | start with is the same side wrist |
| 64.24 | 3.92 | 68.16 | drag so i"m going to grab the same side |
| 65.76 | 5.36 | 71.12 | wrist as my partner i"m going to drag |
| 68.16 | 3.84 | 72.00 | inside up to the armpit pull and step |
| 71.12 | 2.96 | 74.08 | what happens |
| 72.00 | 3.04 | 75.04 | right after the other so i"m gonna grab |
| 74.08 | 3.44 | 77.52 | up to the armpit |
| 75.04 | 3.36 | 78.40 | and i"m gonna pull and step inside okay |
| 77.52 | 3.60 | 81.12 | full step |
| 78.40 | 4.56 | 82.96 | inside i never step outside at least if |
| 81.12 | 2.40 | 83.52 | i"m setting up my shot i never step |
| 82.96 | 2.80 | 85.76 | outside |
| 83.52 | 3.44 | 86.96 | if i"m stepping outside he"s just gonna |
| 85.76 | 3.20 | 88.96 | circle his hips away |
| 86.96 | 3.76 | 90.72 | okay and i"m gonna have to chase him all |
| 88.96 | 5.04 | 94.00 | right cut the distance in half |
| 90.72 | 6.56 | 97.28 | and step inside same side wrist |
| 94.00 | 4.48 | 98.48 | pull up the armpit step across see how |
| 97.28 | 3.12 | 100.40 | his body even turns away and he"s |
| 98.48 | 3.76 | 102.24 | perfectly set up for my double leg |
| 100.40 | 3.20 | 103.60 | okay let"s do our snap drag if your |
| 102.24 | 2.72 | 104.96 | partner"s reaching |
| 103.60 | 3.20 | 106.80 | they don"t even have to touch you if |
| 104.96 | 4.32 | 109.28 | they do touch you you can do it |
| 106.80 | 3.92 | 110.72 | or if it hands on the way you can do it |
| 109.28 | 2.64 | 111.92 | but you see how his hand is pretty much |
| 110.72 | 4.16 | 114.88 | ending up in the same |
| 111.92 | 4.56 | 116.48 | position as my wrist grab so if he"s |
| 114.88 | 4.80 | 119.68 | posted |
| 116.48 | 5.52 | 122.00 | all you have to do is snap |
| 119.68 | 2.32 | 122.00 | drag |
| 124.00 | 4.96 | 128.96 | same thing if it"s on the way |
| 127.68 | 3.12 | 130.80 | right if you can see that he has a |
| 128.96 | 3.20 | 132.16 | tendency where he keeps posting he keeps |
| 130.80 | 3.12 | 133.92 | posting you even catch it |
| 132.16 | 4.40 | 136.56 | when it"s on the way up so we"re down |
| 133.92 | 6.08 | 140.00 | here i see the wrist is coming |
| 136.56 | 4.64 | 141.20 | step time it third is the windmill drag |
| 140.00 | 3.44 | 143.44 | my personal favorite |
| 141.20 | 3.68 | 144.88 | so again you can catch it on the way up |
| 143.44 | 2.88 | 146.32 | or you could already be posted for |
| 144.88 | 2.24 | 147.12 | simplicity"s sake i"ll have them already |
| 146.32 | 3.84 | 150.16 | be posted |
| 147.12 | 3.04 | 150.16 | i"m gonna win mill |
| 150.32 | 7.60 | 157.92 | to the armpit my hand is coming inside |
| 154.32 | 6.16 | 160.48 | right at the wrist i never grab his hand |
| 157.92 | 4.32 | 162.24 | it just continues in motion straight |
| 160.48 | 6.08 | 166.56 | across my midsection |
| 162.24 | 7.52 | 169.76 | it continues in motion i never grab it |
| 166.56 | 6.08 | 172.64 | my finger stays tight against my hand |
| 169.76 | 4.08 | 173.84 | and then step inside your double head |
| 172.64 | 4.32 | 176.96 | outside single |
| 173.84 | 3.84 | 177.68 | or you can even take the back one more |
| 176.96 | 2.64 | 179.60 | time |
| 177.68 | 3.60 | 181.28 | the reason i prefer this is the wrist |
| 179.60 | 3.84 | 183.44 | grab is going to develop |
| 181.28 | 3.60 | 184.88 | your drag it"s going to develop it from |
| 183.44 | 2.64 | 186.08 | a very basic level because everything"s |
| 184.88 | 4.48 | 189.36 | stationary |
| 186.08 | 3.92 | 190.00 | but the downfall of the wrist grab drag |
| 189.36 | 2.72 | 192.08 | is that |
| 190.00 | 3.04 | 193.04 | they can always have an idea of what"s |
| 192.08 | 2.96 | 195.04 | coming |
| 193.04 | 3.36 | 196.40 | okay because this is controlled they |
| 195.04 | 1.68 | 196.72 | know that an attack might be coming from |
| 196.40 | 2.40 | 198.80 | here |
| 196.72 | 4.00 | 200.72 | when you use motion to set up your drag |
| 198.80 | 4.96 | 203.76 | when you use the snap |
| 200.72 | 5.28 | 206.00 | or the windmill there"s no pausing |
| 203.76 | 3.92 | 207.68 | it"s just the hand stays in motion so |
| 206.00 | 4.80 | 210.80 | they have a little time to react |
| 207.68 | 4.08 | 211.76 | okay so use your wrist grab just to set |
| 210.80 | 3.12 | 213.92 | up your motion |
| 211.76 | 3.92 | 215.68 | so you can get used to the drag and then |
| 213.92 | 2.96 | 216.88 | start to prioritize the snap and |
| 215.68 | 3.44 | 219.12 | windmill because they"re |
| 216.88 | 4.24 | 221.12 | um they"re they"re much higher |
| 219.12 | 3.28 | 222.40 | percentage after our drag guys i"m just |
| 221.12 | 3.12 | 224.24 | going to use the basic |
| 222.40 | 4.00 | 226.40 | duck trip that we worked on in our |
| 224.24 | 4.40 | 228.64 | previous video to finish from the back |
| 226.40 | 15.44 | 241.84 | or drive straight through to a double |
| 228.64 | 13.20 | 241.84 | those are your two options |
| 256.80 | 2.96 | 259.76 | get a partner and start drilling if you |
| 258.16 | 3.12 | 261.28 | don"t have a partner you can still hit |
| 259.76 | 3.04 | 262.80 | this in your stance in motion |
| 261.28 | 3.28 | 264.56 | just imagine the reaction that you would |
| 262.80 | 3.84 | 266.64 | need imagine your partner reaching |
| 264.56 | 3.44 | 268.00 | their hand out to touch your shoulder |
| 266.64 | 3.92 | 270.56 | and you intercepting the hand |
| 268.00 | 3.20 | 271.20 | and hitting your drag okay so there"s no |
| 270.56 | 2.64 | 273.20 | reason |
| 271.20 | 3.20 | 274.40 | not to get better we can still hit this |
| 273.20 | 10.64 | 283.84 | in stance in motion |
| 274.40 | 9.44 | 283.84 | even if we don"t have a partner at hand |
