| 0.40 | 3.44 | 3.84 | so continuing on the theme of |
| 1.76 | 3.28 | 5.04 | prioritizing the most common positions |
| 3.84 | 2.72 | 6.56 | you"re going to be ending up in |
| 5.04 | 3.12 | 8.16 | we"re going to introduce a new position |
| 6.56 | 2.48 | 9.04 | the front headlock in every single |
| 8.16 | 3.44 | 11.60 | wrestling match |
| 9.04 | 4.16 | 13.20 | bjj match and in a lot of fights you"re |
| 11.60 | 3.60 | 15.20 | going to end up in the front headlock |
| 13.20 | 3.60 | 16.80 | so having developed motion in this |
| 15.20 | 3.20 | 18.40 | position through drills |
| 16.80 | 3.12 | 19.92 | and having an idea of what you"re aiming |
| 18.40 | 2.64 | 21.04 | for is vitally important if you"re going |
| 19.92 | 3.20 | 23.12 | to be successful |
| 21.04 | 3.20 | 24.24 | from your feet there"s a lot of |
| 23.12 | 2.24 | 25.36 | different ways you can end up in the |
| 24.24 | 2.80 | 27.04 | front headlock position |
| 25.36 | 3.52 | 28.88 | for simplicity"s sake we"re going to |
| 27.04 | 3.36 | 30.40 | assume our partner takes a shot |
| 28.88 | 3.44 | 32.32 | and we just have a good reaction we |
| 30.40 | 5.36 | 35.76 | sprawl and we catch them here |
| 32.32 | 5.76 | 38.08 | so alex takes a shot we sprawl and |
| 35.76 | 4.32 | 40.08 | we catch them in a front headlock okay |
| 38.08 | 2.32 | 40.40 | so a couple key points here let"s back |
| 40.08 | 2.24 | 42.32 | up |
| 40.40 | 3.12 | 43.52 | a couple key points here you want your |
| 42.32 | 3.04 | 45.36 | lead leg hand |
| 43.52 | 4.00 | 47.52 | my lead leg is my right leg so my right |
| 45.36 | 4.16 | 49.52 | hand is going to be cupping the chin |
| 47.52 | 3.92 | 51.44 | right you know from our peek-out video |
| 49.52 | 2.40 | 51.92 | that if i land with my hands over his |
| 51.44 | 3.52 | 54.96 | ribs |
| 51.92 | 7.52 | 59.44 | he has an opportunity to peek out okay |
| 54.96 | 7.36 | 62.32 | so defensively when a guy shoots on you |
| 59.44 | 3.44 | 62.88 | get in the habit of catching at the chin |
| 62.32 | 2.32 | 64.64 | okay |
| 62.88 | 3.20 | 66.08 | we want to we don"t want to end up here |
| 64.64 | 2.24 | 66.88 | but we"re giving him offensive |
| 66.08 | 3.36 | 69.44 | opportunities |
| 66.88 | 4.40 | 71.28 | have your lead leg hand cup the chin if |
| 69.44 | 3.44 | 72.88 | you were facing camera you can see that |
| 71.28 | 3.68 | 74.96 | alex"s chin is right in the palm of my |
| 72.88 | 4.16 | 77.04 | hand my opposing hand my other hand |
| 74.96 | 4.32 | 79.28 | is cupping right at his armpit i"m |
| 77.04 | 3.36 | 80.40 | t-rexing my elbows pulling them nice and |
| 79.28 | 3.12 | 82.40 | tight to my side |
| 80.40 | 3.84 | 84.24 | i don"t have my elbows long and |
| 82.40 | 3.36 | 85.76 | accessible if they"re accessible down |
| 84.24 | 3.28 | 87.52 | here for alex and he starts grabbing at |
| 85.76 | 3.60 | 89.36 | my hands and arms he"s tying me up |
| 87.52 | 3.52 | 91.04 | okay he"s going to slow me at the very |
| 89.36 | 4.32 | 93.68 | least he"s going to slow me way down |
| 91.04 | 3.92 | 94.96 | if not escape all together so i keep |
| 93.68 | 2.96 | 96.64 | that from ever happening like keep my |
| 94.96 | 4.40 | 99.36 | elbows nice and tight to my body |
| 96.64 | 3.44 | 100.08 | pulling his chin tight and close pulling |
| 99.36 | 3.20 | 102.56 | my left arm |
| 100.08 | 3.68 | 103.76 | tight and close and my right shoulder is |
| 102.56 | 4.56 | 107.12 | driving down |
| 103.76 | 6.80 | 110.56 | where his neck meets his back |
| 107.12 | 5.76 | 112.88 | i"m condensing space in between my hand |
| 110.56 | 3.68 | 114.24 | and shoulder i keep everything tight i |
| 112.88 | 3.92 | 116.80 | have a really good opportunity |
| 114.24 | 3.04 | 117.28 | here to exhaust him to make him carry my |
| 116.80 | 2.56 | 119.36 | weight |
| 117.28 | 4.16 | 121.44 | okay so he"s got to support all his |
| 119.36 | 4.56 | 123.92 | weight and all of my weight |
| 121.44 | 3.84 | 125.28 | and i"m supporting none okay so and they |
| 123.92 | 3.36 | 127.28 | can support my weight |
| 125.28 | 3.28 | 128.56 | now what do i want from here what"s the |
| 127.28 | 3.28 | 130.56 | advantage of being here |
| 128.56 | 3.28 | 131.84 | i don"t just hang out right because he"s |
| 130.56 | 3.12 | 133.68 | going to be trying to escape i want to |
| 131.84 | 3.60 | 135.44 | advance my position |
| 133.68 | 3.04 | 136.72 | the most one of the most advantageous |
| 135.44 | 3.84 | 139.28 | positions you can be in |
| 136.72 | 4.48 | 141.20 | is on someone"s back okay you might be |
| 139.28 | 3.52 | 142.80 | thinking if you"re a bjj guy why i have |
| 141.20 | 2.96 | 144.16 | a guillotine here i have darces why |
| 142.80 | 5.04 | 147.84 | don"t i just go for those |
| 144.16 | 5.68 | 149.84 | you can you can uh but the theory being |
| 147.84 | 3.68 | 151.52 | if i go for those if i go for these |
| 149.84 | 4.00 | 153.84 | attacks and i don"t get them |
| 151.52 | 3.60 | 155.12 | right and i don"t get them i end up on |
| 153.84 | 4.72 | 158.56 | bottom right |
| 155.12 | 4.00 | 159.12 | in a deficit i don"t wanna i don"t want |
| 158.56 | 3.12 | 161.68 | my |
| 159.12 | 3.84 | 162.96 | the possibility of my failed attempts to |
| 161.68 | 4.56 | 166.24 | put me in a deficit |
| 162.96 | 4.88 | 167.84 | okay so i wanna give you the option |
| 166.24 | 4.56 | 170.80 | of taking the back from here just so you |
| 167.84 | 5.92 | 173.76 | have it in your arsenal how do i do that |
| 170.80 | 3.68 | 174.48 | i need to circle to his back why don"t i |
| 173.76 | 3.60 | 177.36 | just circle |
| 174.48 | 4.96 | 179.44 | immediately because if i don"t get him |
| 177.36 | 4.08 | 181.44 | on his elbows if i don"t get him |
| 179.44 | 3.76 | 183.20 | with his weight facing forward he"s just |
| 181.44 | 3.44 | 184.88 | gonna snag my leg if i just circle from |
| 183.20 | 3.04 | 186.24 | here he"s just gonna snag my leg |
| 184.88 | 3.12 | 188.00 | maybe even pull it in on a single and |
| 186.24 | 2.48 | 188.72 | now we"re in here wrestling and he has a |
| 188.00 | 3.52 | 191.52 | chance |
| 188.72 | 3.60 | 192.32 | to finish okay i"m gonna keep that from |
| 191.52 | 3.20 | 194.72 | ever happening |
| 192.32 | 3.04 | 195.36 | by snapping him down to his face you |
| 194.72 | 3.60 | 198.32 | always want to |
| 195.36 | 4.80 | 200.16 | snap him through the mat not to the mat |
| 198.32 | 3.52 | 201.84 | i"m going to create a small separation |
| 200.16 | 3.68 | 203.84 | between us just for a moment |
| 201.84 | 3.04 | 204.88 | i"m going to go down to a knee just for |
| 203.84 | 4.56 | 208.40 | a moment |
| 204.88 | 4.96 | 209.84 | and pull him down in him see how he"s on |
| 208.40 | 3.12 | 211.52 | his elbows |
| 209.84 | 3.12 | 212.96 | now he can"t raise his hands up off the |
| 211.52 | 2.96 | 214.48 | ground to catch me |
| 212.96 | 4.88 | 217.84 | so i"m going to throw my chest high make |
| 214.48 | 7.84 | 222.32 | him carry my weight the whole time |
| 217.84 | 6.64 | 224.48 | pressure in pressure in and i snag |
| 222.32 | 4.00 | 226.32 | his near side angle okay there"s a lot |
| 224.48 | 3.12 | 227.60 | of ways to finish from here you can just |
| 226.32 | 3.36 | 229.68 | circle and take the back |
| 227.60 | 3.12 | 230.72 | but a very detailed technical way to |
| 229.68 | 4.24 | 233.92 | take the back |
| 230.72 | 6.00 | 236.72 | is to turn his chin away |
| 233.92 | 4.24 | 238.16 | as you circle so after i snapped throw |
| 236.72 | 4.24 | 240.96 | my chest high |
| 238.16 | 3.60 | 241.76 | turn his chin away i lace my forearm |
| 240.96 | 2.72 | 243.68 | over top |
| 241.76 | 3.20 | 244.96 | since his face is facing away he can"t |
| 243.68 | 2.88 | 246.56 | turn into me okay |
| 244.96 | 3.76 | 248.72 | he"s gonna go away his body goes so he |
| 246.56 | 4.16 | 250.72 | no longer has the option to turn into me |
| 248.72 | 3.68 | 252.40 | also as i"m circling if he"s an |
| 250.72 | 4.08 | 254.80 | experienced grappler he can start |
| 252.40 | 3.84 | 256.24 | circling away so if i"m circling here |
| 254.80 | 3.20 | 258.00 | you can start circling away circling |
| 256.24 | 2.88 | 259.12 | away i"ll never get to his back i keep |
| 258.00 | 4.16 | 262.16 | that from happening |
| 259.12 | 4.96 | 264.08 | by snagging his inside ankle okay now |
| 262.16 | 3.52 | 265.68 | i"ve got this entire side of his body |
| 264.08 | 3.60 | 267.68 | laced he can"t turn into me and he can"t |
| 265.68 | 3.76 | 269.44 | circle away i"ve got him he"s trapped |
| 267.68 | 3.60 | 271.28 | once i"ve achieved this position i"ve |
| 269.44 | 2.80 | 272.24 | essentially won now i"m going to |
| 271.28 | 3.52 | 274.80 | bulldoze in |
| 272.24 | 3.20 | 275.44 | with my chest hot i"m going to pull |
| 274.80 | 4.16 | 278.96 | those in |
| 275.44 | 7.60 | 283.04 | with my chest high and flare this ankle |
| 278.96 | 6.72 | 285.68 | right i"m going to flare this ankle |
| 283.04 | 4.80 | 287.84 | best case scenario i"m in side control |
| 285.68 | 5.60 | 291.28 | now i can go to mouth |
| 287.84 | 6.51 | 294.35 | worst case scenario you just take his |
| 291.28 | 3.07 | 294.35 | [Music] |
| 294.84 | 3.00 | 297.84 | back |
| 302.96 | 5.92 | 308.88 | partner shoots you catch them |
| 306.08 | 4.32 | 310.40 | at the chin and armpit you meet their |
| 308.88 | 4.72 | 313.60 | pressure with your own pressure |
| 310.40 | 5.28 | 315.68 | you push in you feel them push back you |
| 313.60 | 3.92 | 317.52 | separate for a moment a little six inch |
| 315.68 | 4.72 | 320.40 | separation with your shoulder |
| 317.52 | 4.00 | 321.52 | small little six inch separation |
| 320.40 | 3.44 | 323.84 | reverberate |
| 321.52 | 4.00 | 325.52 | and pull them in watch my hips i"m going |
| 323.84 | 3.12 | 326.96 | to snap him with my hips i"m not just |
| 325.52 | 4.80 | 330.32 | pulling with my arms |
| 326.96 | 5.92 | 332.88 | i pull and my hips come down the full |
| 330.32 | 5.20 | 335.52 | weight of my body |
| 332.88 | 4.00 | 336.88 | the full weight of my body is snapping |
| 335.52 | 4.00 | 339.52 | and pulling him |
| 336.88 | 4.88 | 341.76 | in now i throw my chest high the whole |
| 339.52 | 4.72 | 344.24 | time i"m making carry my weight |
| 341.76 | 3.92 | 345.68 | make him carry your weight place your |
| 344.24 | 3.76 | 348.00 | forearm over top of his neck |
| 345.68 | 3.76 | 349.44 | turn his chin away come up onto your |
| 348.00 | 3.04 | 351.04 | feet |
| 349.44 | 3.12 | 352.56 | slide the inside of your hand you don"t |
| 351.04 | 3.84 | 354.88 | need to use your thumb |
| 352.56 | 3.52 | 356.08 | you"re not grabbing his ankle you"re |
| 354.88 | 3.76 | 358.64 | hooking his ankle |
| 356.08 | 4.56 | 360.64 | if you grab his ankle the position of |
| 358.64 | 4.40 | 363.04 | your thumb is going to limit the depth |
| 360.64 | 3.44 | 364.08 | of your hook so keep your thumb to the |
| 363.04 | 4.00 | 367.04 | side of your hand |
| 364.08 | 4.40 | 368.48 | and hook deep on his ankle here now he |
| 367.04 | 4.16 | 371.20 | can"t go anywhere |
| 368.48 | 4.72 | 373.20 | now he"s completely cased okay now i"m |
| 371.20 | 3.84 | 375.04 | going to come up onto my feet |
| 373.20 | 3.44 | 376.64 | bulldoze my chest you see how his hips |
| 375.04 | 4.00 | 379.04 | start to go down to the ground |
| 376.64 | 3.76 | 380.40 | immediately he starts to tilt and now he |
| 379.04 | 3.60 | 382.64 | can"t go anywhere he has to |
| 380.40 | 3.76 | 384.16 | he has to abide by this pressure because |
| 382.64 | 2.96 | 385.60 | i"ve got this entire side of his body |
| 384.16 | 5.20 | 389.36 | cased he can"t go |
| 385.60 | 5.20 | 390.80 | so i push in and as i do i start to tilt |
| 389.36 | 4.64 | 394.00 | my shoulders |
| 390.80 | 6.32 | 397.12 | i start to tilt my shoulders and |
| 394.00 | 6.29 | 400.29 | lift his ankle up |
| 397.12 | 4.32 | 401.44 | and flare it to the side |
| 400.29 | 6.67 | 406.96 | [Music] |
| 401.44 | 5.52 | 406.96 | release you"re in side control |
| 407.12 | 3.20 | 410.32 | let"s get right back down in that |
| 408.16 | 4.80 | 412.96 | position let"s say |
| 410.32 | 3.44 | 413.76 | he"s fighting me really hard okay very |
| 412.96 | 1.92 | 414.88 | common |
| 413.76 | 2.40 | 416.16 | you"re not always going to be able to |
| 414.88 | 2.08 | 416.96 | get that flare guys are going to be |
| 416.16 | 2.24 | 418.40 | basing up |
| 416.96 | 4.08 | 421.04 | they"re going to be posting they"re just |
| 418.40 | 4.32 | 422.72 | going to have a stable base here so |
| 421.04 | 4.08 | 425.12 | i"m not he"s fighting me i"m not going |
| 422.72 | 4.88 | 427.60 | to be able to lift at the very least |
| 425.12 | 4.56 | 429.68 | guys the back take is right here it"s |
| 427.60 | 5.20 | 432.80 | right here |
| 429.68 | 4.80 | 434.48 | just take his back it"s actually it"s |
| 432.80 | 4.00 | 436.80 | actually your preference from here |
| 434.48 | 3.28 | 437.76 | once you get here once you"ve achieved |
| 436.80 | 3.28 | 440.08 | this position |
| 437.76 | 3.12 | 440.88 | now you"ve got options you can go to |
| 440.08 | 2.24 | 442.32 | flare |
| 440.88 | 3.52 | 444.40 | or if you just want his back just take |
| 442.32 | 4.16 | 446.48 | his back just keep your chin |
| 444.40 | 3.68 | 448.08 | keep your chin hand keep his face turned |
| 446.48 | 4.08 | 450.56 | away |
| 448.08 | 17.76 | 465.84 | circle your hips behind his hips take |
| 450.56 | 15.28 | 465.84 | his back |
| 477.68 | 4.48 | 482.16 | one final note guys you might have to |
| 479.52 | 5.52 | 485.04 | snap two three times |
| 482.16 | 4.16 | 486.32 | before you get him on his head so if |
| 485.04 | 3.52 | 488.56 | he"s really strong |
| 486.32 | 3.28 | 489.60 | has a really good base and he"s refusing |
| 488.56 | 3.60 | 492.16 | to go down |
| 489.60 | 4.48 | 494.08 | you might have to snap snap snap before |
| 492.16 | 5.04 | 497.20 | you can actually spin okay |
| 494.08 | 6.08 | 500.16 | so once i"m in here make it a habit |
| 497.20 | 4.48 | 501.68 | just to snap two or three times in your |
| 500.16 | 3.44 | 503.60 | drilling okay so |
| 501.68 | 4.40 | 506.08 | when you"re drilling this have to be a |
| 503.60 | 6.64 | 510.24 | good partner stay up on your hands |
| 506.08 | 7.20 | 513.28 | okay so i"m gonna have to snap snap snap |
| 510.24 | 4.64 | 514.88 | to fully get him to go down and collapse |
| 513.28 | 4.72 | 518.00 | his hands now |
| 514.88 | 6.00 | 520.88 | now i can spin and take his back okay |
| 518.00 | 3.20 | 521.20 | um it"s a very very aggressive movement |
| 520.88 | 2.96 | 523.84 | uh |

so continuing on the theme of prioritizing the most common positions you're going to be ending up in we're going to introduce a new position the front headlock in every single wrestling match bjj match and in a lot of fights you're going to end up in the front headlock so having developed motion in this position through drills and having an idea of what you're aiming for is vitally important if you're going to be successful from your feet there's a lot of different ways you can end up in the front headlock position for simplicity's sake we're going to assume our partner takes a shot and we just have a good reaction we sprawl and we catch them here so alex takes a shot we sprawl and we catch them in a front headlock okay so a couple key points here let's back up a couple key points here you want your lead leg hand my lead leg is my right leg so my right hand is going to be cupping the chin right you know from our peek-out video that if i land with my hands over his ribs he has an opportunity to peek out okay so defensively when a guy shoots on you get in the habit of catching at the chin okay we want to we don't want to end up here but we're giving him offensive opportunities have your lead leg hand cup the chin if you were facing camera you can see that alex's chin is right in the palm of my hand my opposing hand my other hand is cupping right at his armpit i'm t-rexing my elbows pulling them nice and tight to my side i don't have my elbows long and accessible if they're accessible down here for alex and he starts grabbing at my hands and arms he's tying me up okay he's going to slow me at the very least he's going to slow me way down if not escape all together so i keep that from ever happening like keep my elbows nice and tight to my body pulling his chin tight and close pulling my left arm tight and close and my right shoulder is driving down where his neck meets his back i'm condensing space in between my hand and shoulder i keep everything tight i have a really good opportunity here to exhaust him to make him carry my weight okay so he's got to support all his weight and all of my weight and i'm supporting none okay so and they can support my weight now what do i want from here what's the advantage of being here i don't just hang out right because he's going to be trying to escape i want to advance my position the most one of the most advantageous positions you can be in is on someone's back okay you might be thinking if you're a bjj guy why i have a guillotine here i have darces why don't i just go for those you can you can uh but the theory being if i go for those if i go for these attacks and i don't get them right and i don't get them i end up on bottom right in a deficit i don't wanna i don't want my the possibility of my failed attempts to put me in a deficit okay so i wanna give you the option of taking the back from here just so you have it in your arsenal how do i do that i need to circle to his back why don't i just circle immediately because if i don't get him on his elbows if i don't get him with his weight facing forward he's just gonna snag my leg if i just circle from here he's just gonna snag my leg maybe even pull it in on a single and now we're in here wrestling and he has a chance to finish okay i'm gonna keep that from ever happening by snapping him down to his face you always want to snap him through the mat not to the mat i'm going to create a small separation between us just for a moment i'm going to go down to a knee just for a moment and pull him down in him see how he's on his elbows now he can't raise his hands up off the ground to catch me so i'm going to throw my chest high make him carry my weight the whole time pressure in pressure in and i snag his near side angle okay there's a lot of ways to finish from here you can just circle and take the back but a very detailed technical way to take the back is to turn his chin away as you circle so after i snapped throw my chest high turn his chin away i lace my forearm over top since his face is facing away he can't turn into me okay he's gonna go away his body goes so he no longer has the option to turn into me also as i'm circling if he's an experienced grappler he can start circling away so if i'm circling here you can start circling away circling away i'll never get to his back i keep that from happening by snagging his inside ankle okay now i've got this entire side of his body laced he can't turn into me and he can't circle away i've got him he's trapped once i've achieved this position i've essentially won now i'm going to bulldoze in with my chest hot i'm going to pull those in with my chest high and flare this ankle right i'm going to flare this ankle best case scenario i'm in side control now i can go to mouth worst case scenario you just take his [Music] back partner shoots you catch them at the chin and armpit you meet their pressure with your own pressure you push in you feel them push back you separate for a moment a little six inch separation with your shoulder small little six inch separation reverberate and pull them in watch my hips i'm going to snap him with my hips i'm not just pulling with my arms i pull and my hips come down the full weight of my body the full weight of my body is snapping and pulling him in now i throw my chest high the whole time i'm making carry my weight make him carry your weight place your forearm over top of his neck turn his chin away come up onto your feet slide the inside of your hand you don't need to use your thumb you're not grabbing his ankle you're hooking his ankle if you grab his ankle the position of your thumb is going to limit the depth of your hook so keep your thumb to the side of your hand and hook deep on his ankle here now he can't go anywhere now he's completely cased okay now i'm going to come up onto my feet bulldoze my chest you see how his hips start to go down to the ground immediately he starts to tilt and now he can't go anywhere he has to he has to abide by this pressure because i've got this entire side of his body cased he can't go so i push in and as i do i start to tilt my shoulders i start to tilt my shoulders and lift his ankle up and flare it to the side [Music] release you're in side control let's get right back down in that position let's say he's fighting me really hard okay very common you're not always going to be able to get that flare guys are going to be basing up they're going to be posting they're just going to have a stable base here so i'm not he's fighting me i'm not going to be able to lift at the very least guys the back take is right here it's right here just take his back it's actually it's actually your preference from here once you get here once you've achieved this position now you've got options you can go to flare or if you just want his back just take his back just keep your chin keep your chin hand keep his face turned away circle your hips behind his hips take his back one final note guys you might have to snap two three times before you get him on his head so if he's really strong has a really good base and he's refusing to go down you might have to snap snap snap before you can actually spin okay so once i'm in here make it a habit just to snap two or three times in your drilling okay so when you're drilling this have to be a good partner stay up on your hands okay so i'm gonna have to snap snap snap to fully get him to go down and collapse his hands now now i can spin and take his back okay um it's a very very aggressive movement uh it's not a kind position you want to be like a dog on a bone cupping the chin on the armpit and trying to put their face through the mat [Music]
