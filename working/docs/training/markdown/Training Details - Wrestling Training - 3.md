| 0.03 | 6.35 | 6.38 | okay another skill that I feel is |
| 3.23 | 8.05 | 11.28 | extremely important in our sport is |
| 6.38 | 7.69 | 14.07 | hip-hop okay what I see far too often |
| 11.28 | 7.14 | 18.42 | especially at a youth level there"s one |
| 14.07 | 7.59 | 21.66 | kids turn their hips over they occupy |
| 18.42 | 5.43 | 23.85 | far too much space and that could be |
| 21.66 | 5.40 | 27.06 | problematic if you"re trying to hold |
| 23.85 | 6.18 | 30.03 | someone down let"s say for instance this |
| 27.06 | 4.80 | 31.86 | part of the body is not just my hand but |
| 30.03 | 4.86 | 34.89 | let"s say this is a whole lot right the |
| 31.86 | 6.15 | 38.01 | strongest is usually the middle body if |
| 34.89 | 4.86 | 39.75 | I"m trying to hold him down I would like |
| 38.01 | 4.95 | 42.96 | to hold down his hips |
| 39.75 | 5.16 | 44.91 | if I hit post or turn and I start to |
| 42.96 | 3.81 | 46.77 | occupy too much space and I go either |
| 44.91 | 4.71 | 49.62 | too far towards his head or too far |
| 46.77 | 4.50 | 51.27 | towards his feet now of a sudden I take |
| 49.62 | 4.14 | 53.76 | all that pressure off the middle of his |
| 51.27 | 5.28 | 56.55 | body okay so I"m gonna give you a couple |
| 53.76 | 7.29 | 61.05 | of ways to build the skill of hip |
| 56.55 | 6.54 | 63.09 | pressing what it generally is let"s see |
| 61.05 | 4.80 | 65.85 | so I"m gonna sit and I don"t know if you |
| 63.09 | 5.76 | 68.85 | guys can tell but my feet are perfectly |
| 65.85 | 7.05 | 72.90 | straddling this line in the mat what I |
| 68.85 | 7.32 | 76.17 | want is to not occupy more space than |
| 72.90 | 6.48 | 79.38 | just this so we"ll start on my butt okay |
| 76.17 | 6.03 | 82.20 | our heels dance than that one foot is |
| 79.38 | 6.24 | 85.62 | going to go under one foot is going to |
| 82.20 | 5.52 | 87.72 | go over and again I don"t want to roll I |
| 85.62 | 4.98 | 90.60 | don"t want to start rolling this way |
| 87.72 | 4.53 | 92.25 | okay I"ll leave this line I want to stay |
| 90.60 | 3.51 | 94.11 | on this line the entire time so we"re |
| 92.25 | 4.77 | 97.02 | here just come up one foot goes under |
| 94.11 | 5.30 | 99.41 | one foot goes over okay yeah knock you |
| 97.02 | 6.51 | 103.53 | pipe just about the same amount of space |
| 99.41 | 6.76 | 106.17 | again I"m here my hips come up and I can |
| 103.53 | 5.22 | 108.75 | hear Pais and I wind up in the exact |
| 106.17 | 5.52 | 111.69 | same spot now what we"re gonna do next |
| 108.75 | 6.18 | 114.93 | is justice sitting US law he"s gonna do |
| 111.69 | 4.02 | 115.71 | it by himself that"s it yeah all the way |
| 114.93 | 3.39 | 118.32 | down okay |
| 115.71 | 5.49 | 121.20 | and now he"s going to create some |
| 118.32 | 3.84 | 122.16 | pressure against the wall and he"s going |
| 121.20 | 4.26 | 125.46 | to hit my |
| 122.16 | 7.14 | 129.30 | and look freezer thick but you notice is |
| 125.46 | 5.49 | 130.95 | he created space away from the wall okay |
| 129.30 | 3.93 | 133.23 | and that"s important especially a folk |
| 130.95 | 5.79 | 136.74 | style because you can turn and get away |
| 133.23 | 6.45 | 139.68 | right but also he didn"t occupy much |
| 136.74 | 7.80 | 144.54 | space laterally right what happens is |
| 139.68 | 7.71 | 147.39 | especially please okay if he just turns |
| 144.54 | 4.59 | 149.13 | here it"s a whole lot easier for me to |
| 147.39 | 3.87 | 151.26 | kind of circle up behind him right would |
| 149.13 | 6.47 | 155.60 | it be creates pressure and hip heists |
| 151.26 | 8.10 | 159.36 | out now all of a sudden he"s not just |
| 155.60 | 6.01 | 161.61 | further away from me but he"s his hips |
| 159.36 | 4.71 | 164.07 | are also 180 degrees away from you so |
| 161.61 | 4.92 | 166.53 | and I"m here to collect his hips I got a |
| 164.07 | 4.32 | 168.39 | long way to go right so again he creates |
| 166.53 | 2.85 | 169.38 | a little bit back pressure and hip I see |
| 168.39 | 3.87 | 172.26 | he"s strong |
| 169.38 | 5.13 | 174.51 | okay now whoa couple different ways that |
| 172.26 | 3.69 | 175.95 | you can start to build this skill is |
| 174.51 | 4.32 | 178.83 | again against the wall that"s it that"s |
| 175.95 | 5.55 | 181.50 | longer this time we"re going to get a |
| 178.83 | 4.68 | 183.51 | butt up a little bit higher okay good |
| 181.50 | 3.09 | 184.59 | I"m almost worried like a backwards I |
| 183.51 | 3.78 | 187.29 | can work for are backwards we"re gonna |
| 184.59 | 4.88 | 189.47 | hit America good do it one more time |
| 187.29 | 2.18 | 189.47 | please |
| 191.03 | 4.24 | 195.27 | good if you start getting guys that |
| 193.65 | 4.83 | 198.48 | become a little bit flat from this |
| 195.27 | 6.74 | 202.01 | position maybe we start them okay with |
| 198.48 | 6.57 | 205.05 | one foot up it kinda it trains them to |
| 202.01 | 5.14 | 207.15 | know which one goes over which one go is |
| 205.05 | 4.62 | 209.67 | fine for some huh we"ll get to here and |
| 207.15 | 5.01 | 212.16 | I"ll say okay one foot up and they can |
| 209.67 | 4.59 | 214.26 | occupy the same amount of space now as |
| 212.16 | 5.97 | 218.13 | you start getting better obviously they |
| 214.26 | 7.77 | 222.03 | want to do a platform and the further |
| 218.13 | 5.43 | 223.56 | you go down the more difficult it |
| 222.03 | 9.33 | 231.36 | becomes let"s try and get our head a |
| 223.56 | 10.92 | 234.48 | little bit yeah when you start getting |
| 231.36 | 4.77 | 236.13 | really good at stand up now you can go |
| 234.48 | 4.11 | 238.59 | into a back arch and I"m gonna hold your |
| 236.13 | 5.76 | 241.89 | head okay |
| 238.59 | 5.70 | 244.29 | yeah I"m gonna say one two three I"m |

| 252.33 | 4.95 | 257.28 | dimple let"s do it again only this time |
| 254.34 | 4.05 | 258.39 | I"m not gonna tell him one duh okay so |
| 257.28 | 3.24 | 260.52 | I"m gonna get set but I"m not just gonna |
| 258.39 | 4.59 | 262.98 | drop a dude right but I"m gonna get set |

okay another skill that I feel is extremely important in our sport is hip-hop okay what I see far too often especially at a youth level there's one kids turn their hips over they occupy far too much space and that could be problematic if you're trying to hold someone down let's say for instance this part of the body is not just my hand but let's say this is a whole lot right the strongest is usually the middle body if I'm trying to hold him down I would like to hold down his hips if I hit post or turn and I start to occupy too much space and I go either too far towards his head or too far towards his feet now of a sudden I take all that pressure off the middle of his body okay so I'm gonna give you a couple of ways to build the skill of hip pressing what it generally is let's see so I'm gonna sit and I don't know if you guys can tell but my feet are perfectly straddling this line in the mat what I want is to not occupy more space than just this so we'll start on my butt okay our heels dance than that one foot is going to go under one foot is going to go over and again I don't want to roll I don't want to start rolling this way okay I'll leave this line I want to stay on this line the entire time so we're here just come up one foot goes under one foot goes over okay yeah knock you pipe just about the same amount of space again I'm here my hips come up and I can hear Pais and I wind up in the exact same spot now what we're gonna do next is justice sitting US law he's gonna do it by himself that's it yeah all the way down okay and now he's going to create some pressure against the wall and he's going to hit my and look freezer thick but you notice is he created space away from the wall okay and that's important especially a folk style because you can turn and get away right but also he didn't occupy much space laterally right what happens is especially please okay if he just turns here it's a whole lot easier for me to kind of circle up behind him right would it be creates pressure and hip heists out now all of a sudden he's not just further away from me but he's his hips are also 180 degrees away from you so and I'm here to collect his hips I got a long way to go right so again he creates a little bit back pressure and hip I see he's strong okay now whoa couple different ways that you can start to build this skill is again against the wall that's it that's longer this time we're going to get a butt up a little bit higher okay good I'm almost worried like a backwards I can work for are backwards we're gonna hit America good do it one more time please good if you start getting guys that become a little bit flat from this position maybe we start them okay with one foot up it kinda it trains them to know which one goes over which one go is fine for some huh we'll get to here and I'll say okay one foot up and they can occupy the same amount of space now as you start getting better obviously they want to do a platform and the further you go down the more difficult it becomes let's try and get our head a little bit yeah when you start getting really good at stand up now you can go into a back arch and I'm gonna hold your head okay yeah I'm gonna say one two three I'm gonna let go okay Joe's gonna hit - ready block two three zero can't believe it first date no he's pretty getting this game okay but we're gonna make it dimple let's do it again only this time I'm not gonna tell him one duh okay so I'm gonna get set but I'm not just gonna drop a dude right but I'm gonna get set and I'm gonna let go and he's gonna have to feel when the hip okay now again the lower you get the harder it becomes okay this is pretty darn low you think you
