| 0.03 | 4.80 | 4.83 | all right so the first thing we"re gonna |
| 1.53 | 5.37 | 6.90 | go over is how you set up how"s your |
| 4.83 | 3.33 | 8.16 | stance when you go out and shake hands |
| 6.90 | 2.46 | 9.36 | what are you doing how what are you |
| 8.16 | 2.88 | 11.04 | thinking about how are you gonna put |
| 9.36 | 2.94 | 12.30 | yourself in a position to score how you |
| 11.04 | 4.20 | 15.24 | gonna put yourself in a position to |
| 12.30 | 5.25 | 17.55 | limit his his attacks most of the time |
| 15.24 | 5.31 | 20.55 | when I talk about stance it"s really |
| 17.55 | 4.95 | 22.50 | about your your elevation so how how |
| 20.55 | 4.02 | 24.57 | high are you at relative to your |
| 22.50 | 3.18 | 25.68 | opponent so a lot of times you"ll see |
| 24.57 | 3.18 | 27.75 | guys and they"ll have the exact same |
| 25.68 | 3.69 | 29.37 | stance every time exact same stance |
| 27.75 | 3.09 | 30.84 | every time and they won"t make any |
| 29.37 | 2.97 | 32.34 | adjustments really they"ll just be |
| 30.84 | 3.24 | 34.08 | trying to go forward just be trying to |
| 32.34 | 4.08 | 36.42 | put a backward and they will they won"t |
| 34.08 | 3.54 | 37.62 | feel let themselves flow side to side |
| 36.42 | 3.96 | 40.38 | they won"t let themselves change |
| 37.62 | 4.80 | 42.42 | elevation and what happens a lot of |
| 40.38 | 3.69 | 44.07 | times that they get stuck in one tiny |
| 42.42 | 6.08 | 48.50 | little tiny little area when there"s |
| 44.07 | 6.75 | 50.82 | this huge space to wrestling and I |
| 48.50 | 4.45 | 52.95 | always caught like a jumping-off point |
| 50.82 | 5.25 | 56.07 | so the first thing I"m thinking about is |
| 52.95 | 5.22 | 58.17 | I"m gonna make sure that I"m not |
| 56.07 | 4.05 | 60.12 | happening slower than he is my eyes are |
| 58.17 | 4.02 | 62.19 | just a little bit lower than his are so |
| 60.12 | 3.60 | 63.72 | that I know that he"s gonna have to make |
| 62.19 | 3.39 | 65.58 | a dramatic level change and go through |
| 63.72 | 4.41 | 68.13 | my entire field of vision before he can |
| 65.58 | 4.95 | 70.53 | attack so the first thing I do I"m a |
| 68.13 | 4.86 | 72.99 | right leg lead so when I"m in my stance |
| 70.53 | 4.35 | 74.88 | 8-bits in his stance my goal is just to |
| 72.99 | 4.35 | 77.34 | be a little bit lower than his now it |
| 74.88 | 4.53 | 79.41 | doesn"t happen always but for the most |
| 77.34 | 3.96 | 81.30 | part when you wrestle guy in your weight |
| 79.41 | 3.66 | 83.07 | class you"re probably gonna be able to |
| 81.30 | 4.47 | 85.77 | do this and a lot of times you"ll see |
| 83.07 | 5.01 | 88.08 | this guys will come in like oh my eyes |
| 85.77 | 5.03 | 90.80 | are lower than his but now I"m straight |
| 88.08 | 5.07 | 93.15 | like it and that could be a big problem |
| 90.80 | 4.66 | 95.46 | because when you go straight legged like |
| 93.15 | 5.97 | 99.12 | you your ability to move side to side |
| 95.46 | 5.28 | 100.74 | and defend greatly diminishes so when |
| 99.12 | 4.11 | 103.23 | you"re in your stance you want to have |
| 100.74 | 4.98 | 105.72 | your button down and a good knee bend so |
| 103.23 | 5.07 | 108.30 | when you have when I talk about being in |
| 105.72 | 4.89 | 110.61 | my stance it"s not just about having oh |
| 108.30 | 4.41 | 112.71 | my butts really load up under here well |
| 110.61 | 3.63 | 114.24 | right now I have no power so you don"t |
| 112.71 | 3.79 | 116.50 | want to go through too many extremes |
| 114.24 | 6.17 | 120.41 | when you"re in your stance |
| 116.50 | 6.13 | 122.63 | and another really important part is how |
| 120.41 | 4.92 | 125.33 | my back is set up you"ll see some guys |
| 122.63 | 5.94 | 128.57 | hunched over like this and wrestling in |
| 125.33 | 6.96 | 132.29 | their states like this the reason that"s |
| 128.57 | 5.04 | 133.61 | a problem is you don"t you don"t recruit |
| 132.29 | 3.42 | 135.71 | the muscles on the back side of your |
| 133.61 | 3.99 | 137.60 | body so if you"re if you"re wrestling |
| 135.71 | 3.51 | 139.22 | like this and you"re hunched over you"re |
| 137.60 | 4.26 | 141.86 | using all the front side of your muscles |
| 139.22 | 4.53 | 143.75 | so using your quadrant ativy is using |
| 141.86 | 5.37 | 147.23 | basically your anterior chain is what we |
| 143.75 | 5.58 | 149.33 | call it so what you have to do if you go |
| 147.23 | 4.08 | 151.31 | as soon as you go flat back right here |
| 149.33 | 4.32 | 153.65 | now my hamstrings are engaged my |
| 151.31 | 4.98 | 156.29 | Catherines engaged and now I can create |
| 153.65 | 6.81 | 160.46 | more pallet and and my ability to move |
| 156.29 | 6.39 | 162.68 | in my stance becomes you know just goes |
| 160.46 | 4.65 | 165.11 | through the roof so that"s the first |
| 162.68 | 5.55 | 168.23 | part of of what I want to talk about is |
| 165.11 | 4.47 | 169.58 | just holding a good stance now we got |
| 168.23 | 4.32 | 172.55 | the legs what am I going to do with my |
| 169.58 | 5.46 | 175.04 | arms a lot of times when we"re not |
| 172.55 | 4.53 | 177.08 | stance and our partners in our stance so |
| 175.04 | 4.35 | 179.39 | we shake hands and then the first thing |
| 177.08 | 5.34 | 182.42 | you"ll see is guys just attack the head |
| 179.39 | 4.68 | 184.07 | they"ll lunge at the head well when you |
| 182.42 | 4.05 | 186.47 | if you see what happens to my weight |
| 184.07 | 5.37 | 189.44 | distribution when I"m when I"m in my |
| 186.47 | 5.40 | 191.87 | stance in I launch to Gabe"s head all my |
| 189.44 | 5.10 | 194.54 | weight is leaning forward if he takes a |
| 191.87 | 5.01 | 196.88 | small step back chops my arms or level |
| 194.54 | 4.29 | 198.83 | changes goes post there"s a lot of |
| 196.88 | 5.16 | 202.04 | different things that can happen because |
| 198.83 | 7.29 | 206.12 | you want you got so anxious to go touch |
| 202.04 | 6.09 | 208.13 | it so what we call it and and what I do |
| 206.12 | 3.99 | 210.11 | is I just call it a head lead so the |
| 208.13 | 4.14 | 212.27 | first point of contact is always my head |
| 210.11 | 4.47 | 214.58 | so anytime whereas on the |
| 212.27 | 5.31 | 217.58 | contact I"ll keep in my stance I"ll move |
| 214.58 | 5.67 | 220.25 | in my stance heads first arms are |
| 217.58 | 6.72 | 224.30 | relaxed ready to down block ready to |
| 220.25 | 6.09 | 226.34 | stop his first attack so when I"m when |
| 224.30 | 5.43 | 229.73 | I"m wrestling my goal is always to work |
| 226.34 | 7.56 | 233.90 | down and up so rarely are you gonna see |
| 229.73 | 6.30 | 236.03 | me breech up here to his head most of |
| 233.90 | 3.96 | 237.86 | the time it"ll be down low I"ll be |
| 236.03 | 4.26 | 240.29 | looking at grab wrist and then I"m |
| 237.86 | 6.57 | 244.43 | climbing and putting him in a position |
| 240.29 | 6.99 | 247.28 | that I that I want to be okay so by |
| 244.43 | 6.09 | 250.52 | doing that you eliminate some of the |
| 247.28 | 4.71 | 251.99 | possibilities that he has well if I grab |
| 250.52 | 2.70 | 253.22 | someone"s wrist if someone grabs my |
| 251.99 | 3.72 | 255.71 | wrist there"s a few things I can do I |
| 253.22 | 8.31 | 261.53 | can go drag I can fight the thumb go |
| 255.71 | 7.59 | 263.30 | single leg attack blow but if if |
| 261.53 | 3.75 | 265.28 | someone"s if someone"s staying low and |
| 263.30 | 5.52 | 268.82 | going for my wrist rarely am I gonna try |
| 265.28 | 5.10 | 270.38 | to reach up because if I go to grab and |
| 268.82 | 3.87 | 272.69 | Gabe comes to grab my wrist |
| 270.38 | 4.77 | 275.15 | and I do this what"s exposed though or |
| 272.69 | 4.74 | 277.43 | if I do this if I do this he has an |
| 275.15 | 4.20 | 279.35 | opportunity to get to my lips so that"s |
| 277.43 | 4.62 | 282.05 | why I need to be disciplined and where I |
| 279.35 | 6.21 | 285.56 | keep my hands relaxed my arms relaxed |
| 282.05 | 6.72 | 288.77 | there and be intelligent with where I"m |
| 285.56 | 6.18 | 291.74 | gonna grab this guy at the start so |
| 288.77 | 5.19 | 293.96 | again good position knees are bent bus |
| 291.74 | 4.11 | 295.85 | down back is flat head is up I"m trying |
| 293.96 | 3.33 | 297.29 | to trap his hips okay |
| 295.85 | 3.24 | 299.09 | not looking at his eyes and I"m looking |
| 297.29 | 3.99 | 301.28 | at his feet I"m trying to look at his |
| 299.09 | 4.05 | 303.14 | hips so that my peripheral vision can |
| 301.28 | 4.11 | 305.39 | watch my his head goes and watch where |
| 303.14 | 4.59 | 307.73 | his feet goes first thing we do head |
| 305.39 | 3.93 | 309.32 | contact now there"s gonna be some times |
| 307.73 | 4.28 | 312.01 | where you do reach up to grab the head |
| 309.32 | 6.71 | 316.03 | or pop the head I"ll pop the head just |
| 312.01 | 5.73 | 317.74 | and head in the pocket or I"ll go caller |
| 316.03 | 3.75 | 319.78 | tied to try to get here so I have an |
| 317.74 | 4.29 | 322.03 | angle on this guy and most of time when |
| 319.78 | 4.89 | 324.67 | we talk about angles it"s tiny tiny |
| 322.03 | 4.59 | 326.62 | little angles it"s not like I"m jumping |
| 324.67 | 3.57 | 328.24 | all the way over here to get an angle on |
| 326.62 | 5.64 | 332.26 | him it"s most the time it"s just one |
| 328.24 | 7.56 | 335.80 | small sidestep now if I only got off his |
| 332.26 | 5.43 | 337.69 | centerline like 10 degrees maybe but |
| 335.80 | 3.69 | 339.49 | that"s enough to get him to react if I"m |
| 337.69 | 3.83 | 341.52 | here it is probably going to move his |
| 339.49 | 7.77 | 347.26 | feet and circle the other way |
| 341.52 | 7.84 | 349.36 | so just by holding good position you can |
| 347.26 | 4.44 | 351.70 | dictate where the match is gonna go you |
| 349.36 | 4.14 | 353.50 | can dictate and you have to understand |
| 351.70 | 3.63 | 355.33 | what you"re doing a lot of times guys |
| 353.50 | 2.73 | 356.23 | will come in and they"ll try to wrestle |
| 355.33 | 2.85 | 358.18 | and I"ll be like oh I"m just gonna go |
| 356.23 | 4.59 | 360.82 | out and hit my wrestler"s well there"s a |
| 358.18 | 4.65 | 362.83 | lot deeper than that at the start you |
| 360.82 | 4.20 | 365.02 | have to have a plan and that plan only |
| 362.83 | 3.93 | 366.76 | comes from your practice hours leading |
| 365.02 | 3.00 | 368.02 | up to the event you"re not just going to |
| 366.76 | 2.94 | 369.70 | all of a sudden go out and do it and |
| 368.02 | 3.57 | 371.59 | then have a really good understanding of |
| 369.70 | 4.50 | 374.20 | what you"re trying to do a lot of times |
| 371.59 | 5.01 | 376.60 | when you see guys drilling it"ll be you |
| 374.20 | 4.80 | 379.00 | know they"ll come in the walk-in put |
| 376.60 | 5.76 | 382.36 | their hands up and then they"ll go into |
| 379.00 | 5.37 | 384.37 | their drill well that"s okay you"re |
| 382.36 | 4.41 | 386.77 | trying to get the reps in but that |
| 384.37 | 5.67 | 390.04 | there"s no purpose behind that when I |
| 386.77 | 5.19 | 391.96 | drill I"m I start about about five six |
| 390.04 | 4.41 | 394.45 | feet away from them I stay in my stance |
| 391.96 | 6.03 | 397.99 | and I get into am here then I"m going to |
| 394.45 | 7.08 | 401.53 | attack if that makes sense so you have |
| 397.99 | 5.67 | 403.66 | to be very disciplined with your stance |
| 401.53 | 2.79 | 404.32 | in all the minutes that you"re not |
| 403.66 | 4.44 | 408.10 | touching it |
| 404.32 | 5.28 | 409.60 | so practice practice in you know when |
| 408.10 | 3.66 | 411.76 | you when you"re doing your high crotch |
| 409.60 | 4.62 | 414.22 | single leg double leg anything like that |
| 411.76 | 4.80 | 416.56 | most of the time you"re not touching |
| 414.22 | 4.77 | 418.99 | your partner you you know there"s this |
| 416.56 | 4.32 | 420.88 | free space here and that"s that"s the |
| 418.99 | 3.24 | 422.23 | space you need to concentrate on when |
| 420.88 | 3.30 | 424.18 | you start out you know or even when you |
| 422.23 | 5.04 | 427.27 | when you"re older and college level |
| 424.18 | 4.74 | 428.92 | senior level you have to focus on the |
| 427.27 | 3.48 | 430.75 | space that you"re not touching it |
| 428.92 | 5.92 | 434.84 | because if you can stay discipline there |
| 430.75 | 6.73 | 437.48 | you limit his options so |
| 434.84 | 5.61 | 440.45 | back in our good stance on the right leg |
| 437.48 | 4.80 | 442.28 | leave knees bent I"m engaged my |
| 440.45 | 4.05 | 444.50 | hamstrings because now my back is flat |
| 442.28 | 3.84 | 446.12 | I"m looking at his hips and the first |
| 444.50 | 4.08 | 448.58 | contact I"m gonna make is with my head |
| 446.12 | 4.38 | 450.50 | now the first contact I make with is |
| 448.58 | 5.25 | 453.83 | with my head is so that I can download |
| 450.50 | 5.25 | 455.75 | so if my head is here I can feel Gabe |
| 453.83 | 5.13 | 458.96 | doing a level change if Gabe goes level |
| 455.75 | 5.91 | 461.66 | change I could I can react and go down |
| 458.96 | 6.99 | 465.95 | with him where I anticipate and match |
| 461.66 | 6.69 | 468.35 | his level so if it does happen where a |
| 465.95 | 5.73 | 471.68 | guy gets past my head now I have my arms |
| 468.35 | 5.46 | 473.81 | free so the lines of defense head hands |
| 471.68 | 5.85 | 477.53 | hips then you go crazy |
| 473.81 | 6.90 | 480.71 | so if Gabe shoots on me it gets past my |
| 477.53 | 5.46 | 482.99 | head my hands are here to basically |
| 480.71 | 4.71 | 485.42 | knock him off balance or just the stuff |
| 482.99 | 4.71 | 487.70 | at shot he shoots here my hands are |
| 485.42 | 3.78 | 489.20 | there now I can get my legs back now |
| 487.70 | 4.89 | 492.59 | once I"m in this position I can go to |
| 489.20 | 5.52 | 494.72 | school now let"s say game is is really |
| 492.59 | 4.89 | 497.48 | good he shoots you gets past my head in |
| 494.72 | 4.74 | 499.46 | my hands well right here a lot of times |
| 497.48 | 3.36 | 500.84 | guys were like well I got the map to |
| 499.46 | 2.52 | 501.98 | kick out I"m at the bone to funk or I"m |
| 500.84 | 3.24 | 504.08 | just gonna get taken down |
| 501.98 | 3.66 | 505.64 | you got to blast them with your hips now |
| 504.08 | 3.54 | 507.62 | it"s where your hips come in hit them |
| 505.64 | 4.62 | 510.26 | with your hips push them down now I |
| 507.62 | 5.22 | 512.84 | start working to get my hips down away |
| 510.26 | 5.49 | 515.75 | legs down and away away from them so |
| 512.84 | 5.07 | 517.91 | that"s like the basics of your lines of |
| 515.75 | 3.60 | 519.35 | defense you got your head your hands and |
| 517.91 | 2.76 | 520.67 | then you got your hips and then after |
| 519.35 | 3.45 | 522.80 | that you can go crazy when I say go |
| 520.67 | 3.39 | 524.06 | crazy I mean you do all the funk you |
| 522.80 | 3.51 | 526.31 | want to do you can go into crotchless |
| 524.06 | 3.60 | 527.66 | chest wraps all sorts of different |
| 526.31 | 7.14 | 533.45 | things depending on the style that you |
| 527.66 | 8.48 | 536.14 | wrestle so just by holding a good stance |
| 533.45 | 6.06 | 539.51 | and good position you make it so that |
| 536.14 | 6.55 | 542.69 | you dictate the pace and you show this |
| 539.51 | 6.45 | 545.96 | guy where you"re gonna do if I"m if I"m |
| 542.69 | 4.89 | 547.58 | a lefty he"s thinking and he"s a righty |
| 545.96 | 3.03 | 548.99 | he"s think he"s gonna attack my lead leg |
| 547.58 | 3.00 | 550.58 | he"s probably gonna shoot a sweet single |
| 548.99 | 3.84 | 552.83 | or a low single probably gonna try to |
| 550.58 | 3.96 | 554.54 | attack this way when you wrestle |
| 552.83 | 3.45 | 556.28 | somebody that"s a lefty |
| 554.54 | 3.96 | 558.50 | ma your offense is going to change |
| 556.28 | 3.66 | 559.94 | because the right legs further back |
| 558.50 | 4.23 | 562.73 | you"re gonna have to either take a |
| 559.94 | 5.46 | 565.40 | deeper hi crotch or you"re gonna have to |
| 562.73 | 5.25 | 567.98 | attack the front leg so if he"s a and if |
| 565.40 | 4.02 | 569.42 | I"m a righty he"s probably not gonna try |
| 567.98 | 3.33 | 571.31 | to attack this back leg |
| 569.42 | 5.37 | 574.79 | unless you can square me up and then |
| 571.31 | 7.05 | 578.36 | attack why because I"m a right leg lead |
| 574.79 | 6.24 | 581.03 | I know that he"s probably 75% of time |
| 578.36 | 5.10 | 583.46 | he"s coming for this leg and because of |
| 581.03 | 5.16 | 586.19 | that I can prepare myself I can prepare |
| 583.46 | 4.26 | 587.72 | and be ready for this guy to attack so I |
| 586.19 | 3.72 | 589.91 | keep my hand my hands a good position |
| 587.72 | 4.83 | 592.55 | and then when he comes |

all right so the first thing we're gonna go over is how you set up how's your stance when you go out and shake hands what are you doing how what are you thinking about how are you gonna put yourself in a position to score how you gonna put yourself in a position to limit his his attacks most of the time when I talk about stance it's really about your your elevation so how how high are you at relative to your opponent so a lot of times you'll see guys and they'll have the exact same stance every time exact same stance every time and they won't make any adjustments really they'll just be trying to go forward just be trying to put a backward and they will they won't feel let themselves flow side to side they won't let themselves change elevation and what happens a lot of times that they get stuck in one tiny little tiny little area when there's this huge space to wrestling and I always caught like a jumping-off point so the first thing I'm thinking about is I'm gonna make sure that I'm not happening slower than he is my eyes are just a little bit lower than his are so that I know that he's gonna have to make a dramatic level change and go through my entire field of vision before he can attack so the first thing I do I'm a right leg lead so when I'm in my stance 8-bits in his stance my goal is just to be a little bit lower than his now it doesn't happen always but for the most part when you wrestle guy in your weight class you're probably gonna be able to do this and a lot of times you'll see this guys will come in like oh my eyes are lower than his but now I'm straight like it and that could be a big problem because when you go straight legged like you your ability to move side to side and defend greatly diminishes so when you're in your stance you want to have your button down and a good knee bend so when you have when I talk about being in my stance it's not just about having oh my butts really load up under here well right now I have no power so you don't want to go through too many extremes when you're in your stance and another really important part is how my back is set up you'll see some guys hunched over like this and wrestling in their states like this the reason that's a problem is you don't you don't recruit the muscles on the back side of your body so if you're if you're wrestling like this and you're hunched over you're using all the front side of your muscles so using your quadrant ativy is using basically your anterior chain is what we call it so what you have to do if you go as soon as you go flat back right here now my hamstrings are engaged my Catherines engaged and now I can create more pallet and and my ability to move in my stance becomes you know just goes through the roof so that's the first part of of what I want to talk about is just holding a good stance now we got the legs what am I going to do with my arms a lot of times when we're not stance and our partners in our stance so we shake hands and then the first thing you'll see is guys just attack the head they'll lunge at the head well when you if you see what happens to my weight distribution when I'm when I'm in my stance in I launch to Gabe's head all my weight is leaning forward if he takes a small step back chops my arms or level changes goes post there's a lot of different things that can happen because you want you got so anxious to go touch it so what we call it and and what I do is I just call it a head lead so the first point of contact is always my head so anytime whereas on the contact I'll keep in my stance I'll move in my stance heads first arms are relaxed ready to down block ready to stop his first attack so when I'm when I'm wrestling my goal is always to work down and up so rarely are you gonna see me breech up here to his head most of the time it'll be down low I'll be looking at grab wrist and then I'm climbing and putting him in a position that I that I want to be okay so by doing that you eliminate some of the possibilities that he has well if I grab someone's wrist if someone grabs my wrist there's a few things I can do I can go drag I can fight the thumb go single leg attack blow but if if someone's if someone's staying low and going for my wrist rarely am I gonna try to reach up because if I go to grab and Gabe comes to grab my wrist and I do this what's exposed though or if I do this if I do this he has an opportunity to get to my lips so that's why I need to be disciplined and where I keep my hands relaxed my arms relaxed there and be intelligent with where I'm gonna grab this guy at the start so again good position knees are bent bus down back is flat head is up I'm trying to trap his hips okay not looking at his eyes and I'm looking at his feet I'm trying to look at his hips so that my peripheral vision can watch my his head goes and watch where his feet goes first thing we do head contact now there's gonna be some times where you do reach up to grab the head or pop the head I'll pop the head just and head in the pocket or I'll go caller tied to try to get here so I have an angle on this guy and most of time when we talk about angles it's tiny tiny little angles it's not like I'm jumping all the way over here to get an angle on him it's most the time it's just one small sidestep now if I only got off his centerline like 10 degrees maybe but that's enough to get him to react if I'm here it is probably going to move his feet and circle the other way so just by holding good position you can dictate where the match is gonna go you can dictate and you have to understand what you're doing a lot of times guys will come in and they'll try to wrestle and I'll be like oh I'm just gonna go out and hit my wrestler's well there's a lot deeper than that at the start you have to have a plan and that plan only comes from your practice hours leading up to the event you're not just going to all of a sudden go out and do it and then have a really good understanding of what you're trying to do a lot of times when you see guys drilling it'll be you know they'll come in the walk-in put their hands up and then they'll go into their drill well that's okay you're trying to get the reps in but that there's no purpose behind that when I drill I'm I start about about five six feet away from them I stay in my stance and I get into am here then I'm going to attack if that makes sense so you have to be very disciplined with your stance in all the minutes that you're not touching it so practice practice in you know when you when you're doing your high crotch single leg double leg anything like that most of the time you're not touching your partner you you know there's this free space here and that's that's the space you need to concentrate on when you start out you know or even when you when you're older and college level senior level you have to focus on the space that you're not touching it because if you can stay discipline there you limit his options so back in our good stance on the right leg leave knees bent I'm engaged my hamstrings because now my back is flat I'm looking at his hips and the first contact I'm gonna make is with my head now the first contact I make with is with my head is so that I can download so if my head is here I can feel Gabe doing a level change if Gabe goes level change I could I can react and go down with him where I anticipate and match his level so if it does happen where a guy gets past my head now I have my arms free so the lines of defense head hands hips then you go crazy so if Gabe shoots on me it gets past my head my hands are here to basically knock him off balance or just the stuff at shot he shoots here my hands are there now I can get my legs back now once I'm in this position I can go to school now let's say game is is really good he shoots you gets past my head in my hands well right here a lot of times guys were like well I got the map to kick out I'm at the bone to funk or I'm just gonna get taken down you got to blast them with your hips now it's where your hips come in hit them with your hips push them down now I start working to get my hips down away legs down and away away from them so that's like the basics of your lines of defense you got your head your hands and then you got your hips and then after that you can go crazy when I say go crazy I mean you do all the funk you want to do you can go into crotchless chest wraps all sorts of different things depending on the style that you wrestle so just by holding a good stance and good position you make it so that you dictate the pace and you show this guy where you're gonna do if I'm if I'm a lefty he's thinking and he's a righty he's think he's gonna attack my lead leg he's probably gonna shoot a sweet single or a low single probably gonna try to attack this way when you wrestle somebody that's a lefty ma your offense is going to change because the right legs further back you're gonna have to either take a deeper hi crotch or you're gonna have to attack the front leg so if he's a and if I'm a righty he's probably not gonna try to attack this back leg unless you can square me up and then attack why because I'm a right leg lead I know that he's probably 75% of time he's coming for this leg and because of that I can prepare myself I can prepare and be ready for this guy to attack so I keep my hand my hands a good position and then when he comes I can't anticipate that and defend his shop
