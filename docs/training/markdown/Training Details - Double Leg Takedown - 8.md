| 0.24 | 3.28 | 3.52 | this is maybe the most common takedown |
| 2.56 | 2.24 | 4.80 | in all of wrestling all |
| 3.52 | 3.92 | 7.44 | grappling all the fighting it"s the |
| 4.80 | 4.16 | 8.96 | traditional double leg it feeds off of |
| 7.44 | 3.04 | 10.48 | our blast there"s a reason i teach it |
| 8.96 | 2.88 | 11.84 | right after the blast is because the two |
| 10.48 | 2.48 | 12.96 | feet into each other as you"ll see in |
| 11.84 | 2.56 | 14.40 | the technique video |
| 12.96 | 2.80 | 15.76 | it"s not all that different we get a |
| 14.40 | 1.84 | 16.24 | little bit lower drive a little bit |
| 15.76 | 3.12 | 18.88 | deeper |
| 16.24 | 3.44 | 19.68 | we"re level changing one more time from |
| 18.88 | 3.20 | 22.08 | here okay |
| 19.68 | 3.84 | 23.52 | the reason i prioritize these techniques |
| 22.08 | 2.64 | 24.72 | is because they"re the most accessible |
| 23.52 | 2.88 | 26.40 | there are other techniques that might be |
| 24.72 | 3.36 | 28.08 | more applicable for your body type |
| 26.40 | 3.04 | 29.44 | but they take longer to learn so you |
| 28.08 | 2.80 | 30.88 | need to get your feet wet so you cannot |
| 29.44 | 2.32 | 31.76 | under so you can start understanding the |
| 30.88 | 2.80 | 33.68 | concepts |
| 31.76 | 3.52 | 35.28 | of takedowns closing the distance |
| 33.68 | 3.52 | 37.20 | between you and your opponent mat |
| 35.28 | 3.20 | 38.48 | utilizing the drop step this is the |
| 37.20 | 2.08 | 39.28 | first technique that we"re going to use |
| 38.48 | 2.80 | 41.28 | where we"re actually |
| 39.28 | 3.52 | 42.80 | using our drop step so hopefully you"ve |
| 41.28 | 3.44 | 44.72 | watched the stance in motion video if |
| 42.80 | 4.00 | 46.80 | you haven"t go check that out |
| 44.72 | 3.44 | 48.16 | and we"re actually going to be using it |
| 46.80 | 3.60 | 50.40 | now and you"ll see why |
| 48.16 | 4.48 | 52.64 | stance in motion is so important before |
| 50.40 | 3.68 | 54.08 | learning an actual take now |
| 52.64 | 2.88 | 55.52 | like always guys if you"ve never hit a |
| 54.08 | 2.56 | 56.64 | takedown you"ve never hit this takedown |
| 55.52 | 3.12 | 58.64 | a traditional double leg have your |
| 56.64 | 3.76 | 60.40 | partner start a scarecrow |
| 58.64 | 4.16 | 62.80 | we"re gonna take a deep penetration step |
| 60.40 | 4.64 | 65.04 | between their legs as far as we can get |
| 62.80 | 3.92 | 66.72 | chest over knee elbows disciplined into |
| 65.04 | 3.76 | 68.80 | our sides |
| 66.72 | 4.16 | 70.88 | our knees gonna drive over our toe to |
| 68.80 | 5.04 | 73.84 | the ground as it does that my chest and |
| 70.88 | 6.16 | 77.04 | head are going to come up |
| 73.84 | 5.92 | 79.76 | to here my trail leg comes up and posts |
| 77.04 | 2.72 | 79.76 | to the side |
| 80.56 | 3.76 | 84.32 | pushing off my back leg deep knee drives |
| 83.52 | 3.04 | 86.56 | over my toe |
| 84.32 | 4.16 | 88.48 | elbows in knee hits the ground as it |
| 86.56 | 4.08 | 90.64 | hits the ground my chest comes up |
| 88.48 | 3.76 | 92.24 | to here this is not good head position |
| 90.64 | 3.84 | 94.48 | this is not good head position |
| 92.24 | 3.36 | 95.60 | even this is not good head position this |
| 94.48 | 2.64 | 97.12 | is good head position |
| 95.60 | 3.28 | 98.88 | you see how his body starts to tilt the |
| 97.12 | 2.88 | 100.00 | direction i"m going to drive my trail |
| 98.88 | 3.60 | 102.48 | leg comes up and |
| 100.00 | 4.16 | 104.16 | posts to the side not straight in front |
| 102.48 | 4.40 | 106.88 | to the side i"m changing |
| 104.16 | 4.48 | 108.64 | directions ideally i get my hands locked |
| 106.88 | 2.88 | 109.76 | behind him in a monkey grip you can go |
| 108.64 | 4.32 | 112.96 | gable grip or even an |
| 109.76 | 5.60 | 115.36 | s grip i prefer the monkey paw grip over |
| 112.96 | 4.24 | 117.20 | top my wrist if i can"t get this |
| 115.36 | 3.20 | 118.56 | if he starts to sprawl on my entry his |
| 117.20 | 2.72 | 119.92 | legs are going back now i don"t have the |
| 118.56 | 2.80 | 121.36 | length of my arms |
| 119.92 | 3.52 | 123.44 | to get my hands locked i can still |
| 121.36 | 3.36 | 124.72 | finish if my head is up my hips are in |
| 123.44 | 2.80 | 126.24 | my back and straight |
| 124.72 | 3.12 | 127.84 | i have the structure of my skeleton |
| 126.24 | 2.16 | 128.40 | supporting his weight not my muscular |
| 127.84 | 2.64 | 130.48 | system |
| 128.40 | 3.12 | 131.52 | then i"m going to push off this lead leg |
| 130.48 | 3.92 | 134.40 | or my trail rig |
| 131.52 | 4.88 | 136.40 | trail leg rather on to my lead leg i |
| 134.40 | 4.24 | 138.64 | want to be on both legs when i drive |
| 136.40 | 3.68 | 140.08 | maximizing my power my head is leading |
| 138.64 | 2.72 | 141.36 | the movement i look hard in the |
| 140.08 | 6.08 | 146.16 | direction i want to go |
| 141.36 | 6.48 | 147.84 | and then i pull my elbows in as i drive |
| 146.16 | 2.96 | 149.12 | now we have to use the setup in order to |
| 147.84 | 3.20 | 151.04 | get to his legs because he"s going to be |
| 149.12 | 3.36 | 152.48 | down in a stance |
| 151.04 | 2.64 | 153.68 | i"m going to use the exact same setup i |
| 152.48 | 3.04 | 155.52 | use in my blast double i"m going to |
| 153.68 | 2.16 | 155.84 | reach towards his face as his hands come |
| 155.52 | 3.36 | 158.88 | up |
| 155.84 | 3.04 | 158.88 | i swoop underneath |
| 163.68 | 3.76 | 167.44 | so you want to be knocking him back on |
| 165.36 | 2.56 | 167.92 | his heels by the time that you get to |
| 167.44 | 2.80 | 170.24 | him |
| 167.92 | 4.16 | 172.08 | you want to think shoot through him not |
| 170.24 | 2.96 | 173.20 | to him so he"s trying to catch his |
| 172.08 | 3.36 | 175.44 | balance |
| 173.20 | 3.52 | 176.72 | on his heels by the time you are |
| 175.44 | 4.48 | 179.92 | changing direction |
| 176.72 | 3.76 | 180.48 | sideways change level down change level |
| 179.92 | 2.48 | 182.40 | in |
| 180.48 | 4.64 | 185.12 | change level across three different |
| 182.40 | 4.88 | 187.28 | level changes |
| 185.12 | 3.04 | 188.16 | just like my blast i"m leaning over my |
| 187.28 | 3.92 | 191.20 | lead leg i |
| 188.16 | 5.04 | 193.20 | reach step elbows come in i want to be |
| 191.20 | 4.64 | 195.84 | knocking him back |
| 193.20 | 4.00 | 197.20 | with my shoulder by the time i get there |
| 195.84 | 3.76 | 199.60 | post |
| 197.20 | 3.20 | 200.40 | hook just below his butt grip if you can |
| 199.60 | 2.80 | 202.40 | if you can"t |
| 200.40 | 4.00 | 204.40 | you can still finish head leaves the |
| 202.40 | 4.56 | 206.96 | movement push up onto both feet my hips |
| 204.40 | 4.96 | 209.36 | stay underneath me i"m not here |
| 206.96 | 4.32 | 211.28 | my butt is not extended i need my butt |
| 209.36 | 4.72 | 214.08 | under my shoulders here |
| 211.28 | 4.32 | 215.60 | and drive drive pull your knees into |
| 214.08 | 4.24 | 218.32 | side control |
| 215.60 | 3.60 | 219.20 | if you"re a bjj guy just keep your |
| 218.32 | 2.16 | 220.48 | shoulders shrugged |
| 219.20 | 4.16 | 223.36 | everyone"s afraid of getting guillotined |
| 220.48 | 4.32 | 224.80 | here on your entry as you"re entering |
| 223.36 | 2.56 | 225.92 | shrug your shoulders and keeping trucks |
| 224.80 | 3.52 | 228.32 | circumvent that problem from ever |
| 225.92 | 2.40 | 228.32 | happening |
| 236.72 | 3.36 | 240.08 | and even if he does wrap up the |
| 238.72 | 3.84 | 242.56 | guillotine from here even if he |
| 240.08 | 4.80 | 244.88 | does make sure you just circle your hips |
| 242.56 | 4.96 | 247.52 | to the opposite side of your head |
| 244.88 | 2.64 | 247.52 | if i"m here |
| 248.08 | 5.68 | 253.76 | and i"m driving driving driving and |
| 251.28 | 3.84 | 255.12 | my and i"m on the same my hips end up on |
| 253.76 | 4.96 | 258.72 | the same side as my head |
| 255.12 | 4.88 | 260.00 | i"m in trouble but if i practice driving |
| 258.72 | 3.20 | 261.92 | with my hips to the other side of the |
| 260.00 | 3.12 | 263.12 | head then |
| 261.92 | 3.76 | 265.68 | you can actually finish him with a |
| 263.12 | 3.36 | 266.48 | bonfood choke if he doesn"t abandon this |
| 265.68 | 4.16 | 269.84 | position |
| 266.48 | 3.36 | 269.84 | you can finish him |
| 275.12 | 3.09 | 278.21 | [Music] |
| 278.48 | 4.40 | 282.88 | like i"m shooting under a stick like |
| 280.72 | 4.00 | 284.72 | this is reverse limbo |
| 282.88 | 3.68 | 286.56 | right i want to get underneath i"m gonna |
| 284.72 | 3.44 | 288.16 | get as low as i can underneath his head |
| 286.56 | 4.72 | 291.28 | hands defense |
| 288.16 | 4.80 | 292.96 | i get low chest over knee |
| 291.28 | 3.92 | 295.20 | now pretend there"s a stick here and i |
| 292.96 | 3.60 | 296.56 | want my back to graze it on my way up i |
| 295.20 | 4.24 | 299.44 | want to graze it so i go |
| 296.56 | 4.16 | 300.72 | under the stick head stays up my back |
| 299.44 | 3.12 | 302.56 | grazes it |
| 300.72 | 4.56 | 305.28 | and see how there"s no space between me |
| 302.56 | 5.68 | 308.24 | and his legs i"m not up here |
| 305.28 | 4.16 | 309.44 | i"m not hinging at the hips at all okay |
| 308.24 | 4.80 | 313.04 | not even the least bit |
| 309.44 | 6.96 | 316.40 | i"m completely straight head up hips in |
| 313.04 | 4.08 | 317.12 | back straight and my hands pull his legs |
| 316.40 | 4.56 | 320.96 | in |
| 317.12 | 7.04 | 324.16 | as i drive it"s not enough just to drive |
| 320.96 | 3.76 | 324.72 | i have to pull his legs in as i drive so |
| 324.16 | 3.04 | 327.20 | i"m |
| 324.72 | 3.36 | 328.08 | driving pulling his legs in and then i"m |
| 327.20 | 6.16 | 333.36 | circling |
| 328.08 | 5.28 | 333.36 | my legs to the opposite side of my head |
| 336.00 | 4.64 | 340.64 | the reason i teach this in combination |
| 339.20 | 2.64 | 341.84 | with the blast we"re teaching it right |
| 340.64 | 3.52 | 344.16 | after the blast double |
| 341.84 | 4.08 | 345.92 | is because one commonly leads into the |
| 344.16 | 3.44 | 347.60 | other if i"m going to hit my blast |
| 345.92 | 3.76 | 349.68 | double |
| 347.60 | 3.52 | 351.12 | right if i"m going to hit my blast and |
| 349.68 | 3.68 | 353.36 | my partner circles |
| 351.12 | 3.28 | 354.40 | right if i go to my blasting circles on |
| 353.36 | 4.40 | 357.76 | my entry this |
| 354.40 | 6.56 | 360.96 | becomes a traditional double |
| 357.76 | 4.24 | 362.00 | vice versa if i go to hit my traditional |
| 360.96 | 2.96 | 363.92 | double |
| 362.00 | 3.68 | 365.68 | and he circles the other way i go to my |
| 363.92 | 4.08 | 368.00 | head outside he circles this way it just |
| 365.68 | 5.44 | 371.12 | becomes a blast |
| 368.00 | 4.24 | 372.24 | okay no matter how much you practice one |
| 371.12 | 2.88 | 374.00 | or the other |
| 372.24 | 3.84 | 376.08 | you can"t completely ever control your |
| 374.00 | 4.32 | 378.32 | opponent he"s gonna have movement |
| 376.08 | 4.32 | 380.40 | commonly he"s gonna have movement on |
| 378.32 | 5.44 | 383.76 | your entry so train both |
| 380.40 | 3.36 | 383.76 | to greatly increase your chances of |
| 392.84 | 3.00 | 395.84 | finishing |
| 399.68 | 4.64 | 404.32 | now now for guys who are really good |
| 403.12 | 3.28 | 406.40 | defensively |
| 404.32 | 3.36 | 407.68 | if you"re dealing with a guy who has |
| 406.40 | 2.64 | 409.04 | incredible balance maybe he"s a really |
| 407.68 | 3.12 | 410.80 | good athlete |
| 409.04 | 3.20 | 412.24 | and you keep driving keep driving he |
| 410.80 | 3.36 | 414.16 | just won"t go down |
| 412.24 | 3.68 | 415.92 | you"re gonna have to lift him you"re |
| 414.16 | 2.80 | 416.96 | gonna have to get both of his posts both |
| 415.92 | 3.12 | 419.04 | of his legs |
| 416.96 | 3.44 | 420.40 | off the mat how do i do that ideally |
| 419.04 | 2.64 | 421.68 | again you have hands locked |
| 420.40 | 3.52 | 423.92 | if you don"t doesn"t matter you still |
| 421.68 | 3.60 | 425.28 | finish you"re driving |
| 423.92 | 3.28 | 427.20 | he"s just not going down he just keeps |
| 425.28 | 3.28 | 428.56 | catching himself keeps catching himself |
| 427.20 | 5.20 | 432.40 | keeps catching himself |
| 428.56 | 8.16 | 436.72 | i"m gonna step around with my lead leg |
| 432.40 | 5.76 | 438.16 | all the way around to his far leg step |
| 436.72 | 4.24 | 440.96 | and then i"m going to pop my hips i"m |
| 438.16 | 6.64 | 444.80 | not dead lifting stay right here |
| 440.96 | 6.24 | 447.20 | i"m not dead lifting i"m popping my hips |
| 444.80 | 4.56 | 449.36 | and tilting my shoulders and using my |
| 447.20 | 3.84 | 451.04 | head in combination with my arms |
| 449.36 | 4.24 | 453.60 | to get him to go horizontal you"re gonna |
| 451.04 | 4.24 | 455.28 | flare his legs |
| 453.60 | 3.60 | 457.20 | so you come up to both legs he won"t go |
| 455.28 | 10.56 | 465.84 | down i step across |
| 457.20 | 8.64 | 465.84 | i pop flare |
| 467.36 | 3.07 | 470.43 | [Music] |
| 476.84 | 3.00 | 479.84 | huh |
| 486.08 | 2.80 | 488.88 | so as always guys be mindful of your |
| 487.76 | 1.92 | 489.68 | surroundings if you"re getting this |
| 488.88 | 2.32 | 491.20 | inside |
| 489.68 | 2.64 | 492.32 | clear stuff out of the way all right |
| 491.20 | 1.84 | 493.04 | don"t just start hitting this in your |
| 492.32 | 2.96 | 495.28 | living room |
| 493.04 | 4.08 | 497.12 | lay down some pillows some blankets and |
| 495.28 | 3.68 | 498.96 | be mindful of where you"re at |
| 497.12 | 4.00 | 501.12 | maybe you you"re not ready until you get |
| 498.96 | 3.60 | 502.56 | on an actual rustling mat or a bjj mat |
| 501.12 | 1.84 | 502.96 | maybe you"re not ready to flare the legs |
| 502.56 | 2.08 | 504.64 | yet |
| 502.96 | 3.04 | 506.00 | if you"re not ready just pick them |
| 504.64 | 3.68 | 508.32 | straight up as you step |
| 506.00 | 3.68 | 509.68 | around with your lead leg just pick them |
| 508.32 | 3.76 | 512.08 | straight up so you can at least get that |
| 509.68 | 3.76 | 513.44 | lifting motion in your muscular system |
| 512.08 | 3.04 | 515.12 | and then when you get back on the mat |
| 513.44 | 2.88 | 516.32 | you can finish from there if you"re |
| 515.12 | 2.56 | 517.68 | outside in the park and you want to hit |
| 516.32 | 3.44 | 519.76 | this in the grass |
| 517.68 | 3.28 | 520.96 | i"m going to leave that up to you and |
| 519.76 | 9.60 | 529.36 | the toughness of |
| 520.96 | 8.40 | 529.36 | your partner |

## Transcript Text
this is maybe the most common takedown in all of wrestling all grappling all the fighting it's the traditional double leg it feeds off of our blast there's a reason i teach it right after the blast is because the two feet into each other as you'll see in the technique video it's not all that different we get a little bit lower drive a little bit deeper we're level changing one more time from here okay the reason i prioritize these techniques is because they're the most accessible there are other techniques that might be more applicable for your body type but they take longer to learn so you need to get your feet wet so you cannot under so you can start understanding the concepts of takedowns closing the distance between you and your opponent mat utilizing the drop step this is the first technique that we're going to use where we're actually using our drop step so hopefully you've watched the stance in motion video if you haven't go check that out and we're actually going to be using it now and you'll see why stance in motion is so important before learning an actual take now like always guys if you've never hit a takedown you've never hit this takedown a traditional double leg have your partner start a scarecrow we're gonna take a deep penetration step between their legs as far as we can get chest over knee elbows disciplined into our sides our knees gonna drive over our toe to the ground as it does that my chest and head are going to come up to here my trail leg comes up and posts to the side pushing off my back leg deep knee drives over my toe elbows in knee hits the ground as it hits the ground my chest comes up to here this is not good head position this is not good head position even this is not good head position this is good head position you see how his body starts to tilt the direction i'm going to drive my trail leg comes up and posts to the side not straight in front to the side i'm changing directions ideally i get my hands locked behind him in a monkey grip you can go gable grip or even an s grip i prefer the monkey paw grip over top my wrist if i can't get this if he starts to sprawl on my entry his legs are going back now i don't have the length of my arms to get my hands locked i can still finish if my head is up my hips are in my back and straight i have the structure of my skeleton supporting his weight not my muscular system then i'm going to push off this lead leg or my trail rig trail leg rather on to my lead leg i want to be on both legs when i drive maximizing my power my head is leading the movement i look hard in the direction i want to go and then i pull my elbows in as i drive now we have to use the setup in order to get to his legs because he's going to be down in a stance i'm going to use the exact same setup i use in my blast double i'm going to reach towards his face as his hands come up i swoop underneath so you want to be knocking him back on his heels by the time that you get to him you want to think shoot through him not to him so he's trying to catch his balance on his heels by the time you are changing direction sideways change level down change level in change level across three different level changes just like my blast i'm leaning over my lead leg i reach step elbows come in i want to be knocking him back with my shoulder by the time i get there post hook just below his butt grip if you can if you can't you can still finish head leaves the movement push up onto both feet my hips stay underneath me i'm not here my butt is not extended i need my butt under my shoulders here and drive drive pull your knees into side control if you're a bjj guy just keep your shoulders shrugged everyone's afraid of getting guillotined here on your entry as you're entering shrug your shoulders and keeping trucks circumvent that problem from ever happening and even if he does wrap up the guillotine from here even if he does make sure you just circle your hips to the opposite side of your head if i'm here and i'm driving driving driving and my and i'm on the same my hips end up on the same side as my head i'm in trouble but if i practice driving with my hips to the other side of the head then you can actually finish him with a bonfood choke if he doesn't abandon this position you can finish him [Music] like i'm shooting under a stick like this is reverse limbo right i want to get underneath i'm gonna get as low as i can underneath his head hands defense i get low chest over knee now pretend there's a stick here and i want my back to graze it on my way up i want to graze it so i go under the stick head stays up my back grazes it and see how there's no space between me and his legs i'm not up here i'm not hinging at the hips at all okay not even the least bit i'm completely straight head up hips in back straight and my hands pull his legs in as i drive it's not enough just to drive i have to pull his legs in as i drive so i'm driving pulling his legs in and then i'm circling my legs to the opposite side of my head the reason i teach this in combination with the blast we're teaching it right after the blast double is because one commonly leads into the other if i'm going to hit my blast double right if i'm going to hit my blast and my partner circles right if i go to my blasting circles on my entry this becomes a traditional double vice versa if i go to hit my traditional double and he circles the other way i go to my head outside he circles this way it just becomes a blast okay no matter how much you practice one or the other you can't completely ever control your opponent he's gonna have movement commonly he's gonna have movement on your entry so train both to greatly increase your chances of finishing now now for guys who are really good defensively if you're dealing with a guy who has incredible balance maybe he's a really good athlete and you keep driving keep driving he just won't go down you're gonna have to lift him you're gonna have to get both of his posts both of his legs off the mat how do i do that ideally again you have hands locked if you don't doesn't matter you still finish you're driving he's just not going down he just keeps catching himself keeps catching himself keeps catching himself i'm gonna step around with my lead leg all the way around to his far leg step and then i'm going to pop my hips i'm not dead lifting stay right here i'm not dead lifting i'm popping my hips and tilting my shoulders and using my head in combination with my arms to get him to go horizontal you're gonna flare his legs so you come up to both legs he won't go down i step across i pop flare [Music] huh so as always guys be mindful of your surroundings if you're getting this inside clear stuff out of the way all right don't just start hitting this in your living room lay down some pillows some blankets and be mindful of where you're at maybe you you're not ready until you get on an actual rustling mat or a bjj mat maybe you're not ready to flare the legs yet if you're not ready just pick them straight up as you step around with your lead leg just pick them straight up so you can at least get that lifting motion in your muscular system and then when you get back on the mat you can finish from there if you're outside in the park and you want to hit this in the grass i'm going to leave that up to you and the toughness of your partner
