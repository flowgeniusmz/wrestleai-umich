| 0.40 | 3.76 | 4.16 | one of the most common questions i get |
| 2.08 | 3.20 | 5.28 | is what"s the number one takedown what"s |
| 4.16 | 3.12 | 7.28 | the best takedown |
| 5.28 | 3.52 | 8.80 | in grappling if you"re a bjj guy it"s |
| 7.28 | 3.20 | 10.48 | kind of like asking what"s the best way |
| 8.80 | 3.20 | 12.00 | to pass if you"re a striker it"s kind of |
| 10.48 | 3.68 | 14.16 | like being asked what"s the best |
| 12.00 | 4.16 | 16.16 | punch it"s a hard question you need two |
| 14.16 | 4.24 | 18.40 | three four ways to create offense |
| 16.16 | 4.00 | 20.16 | and then circling between those offenses |
| 18.40 | 2.16 | 20.56 | generally opens one of them up but if i |
| 20.16 | 2.24 | 22.40 | had a |
| 20.56 | 3.44 | 24.00 | gun in my head absolutely had to answer |
| 22.40 | 3.84 | 26.24 | no |
| 24.00 | 3.12 | 27.12 | it would be the single leg okay why the |
| 26.24 | 2.56 | 28.80 | single leg |
| 27.12 | 3.28 | 30.40 | the single leg narrows the fight down to |
| 28.80 | 3.20 | 32.00 | a very small corridor you"re using your |
| 30.40 | 2.80 | 33.20 | entire body to attack one of your |
| 32.00 | 3.36 | 35.36 | opponent"s appendages |
| 33.20 | 3.20 | 36.40 | so it"s not only effective in attacking |
| 35.36 | 3.60 | 38.96 | a smaller |
| 36.40 | 3.28 | 39.68 | or same size opponent but a larger |
| 38.96 | 2.32 | 41.28 | opponent |
| 39.68 | 3.20 | 42.88 | it"s a technique that"s largely |
| 41.28 | 3.92 | 45.20 | dependent upon leverage |
| 42.88 | 3.44 | 46.32 | and positioning in angles it has less to |
| 45.20 | 3.36 | 48.56 | do with power |
| 46.32 | 3.44 | 49.76 | it does take a little longer to learn |
| 48.56 | 2.48 | 51.04 | it"s not as accessible |
| 49.76 | 3.44 | 53.20 | as our double legs that"s why i |
| 51.04 | 2.56 | 53.60 | prioritize our double legs they teach |
| 53.20 | 3.76 | 56.96 | you |
| 53.60 | 4.88 | 58.48 | how to cover distance in a quicker way |
| 56.96 | 3.68 | 60.64 | so then when you go to learn the single |
| 58.48 | 4.16 | 62.64 | leg it"s more easily absorbed |
| 60.64 | 3.28 | 63.92 | so if i"m facing a larger opponent this |
| 62.64 | 3.28 | 65.92 | is the real utility |
| 63.92 | 3.20 | 67.12 | of the single leg if i"m up against a |
| 65.92 | 2.72 | 68.64 | larger opponent and i"m planning on |
| 67.12 | 3.44 | 70.56 | hitting a double leg it"s highly |
| 68.64 | 3.84 | 72.48 | unlikely that i"m going to be able to |
| 70.56 | 3.76 | 74.32 | if i"m an inexperienced grappler that |
| 72.48 | 4.80 | 77.28 | italian like i"d be able to |
| 74.32 | 4.80 | 79.12 | power through his size okay there"s a |
| 77.28 | 4.32 | 81.60 | great size and power disparity |
| 79.12 | 4.96 | 84.08 | so using a power and explosive dependent |
| 81.60 | 4.00 | 85.60 | offense is a bad idea that"s why i favor |
| 84.08 | 3.20 | 87.28 | the single leg that"s why the single leg |
| 85.60 | 3.92 | 89.52 | has such great utility because |
| 87.28 | 4.16 | 91.44 | it will cover and be effective against |
| 89.52 | 3.20 | 92.72 | nearly the most effective |
| 91.44 | 4.40 | 95.84 | takedown against every one of your |
| 92.72 | 4.96 | 97.68 | opponents it our lead leg is dependent |
| 95.84 | 3.20 | 99.04 | upon our opponent"s lead leg so frey has |
| 97.68 | 3.20 | 100.88 | his left foot forward that means my |
| 99.04 | 3.44 | 102.48 | right foot has to be forward for my |
| 100.88 | 3.68 | 104.56 | entry to be successful |
| 102.48 | 4.48 | 106.96 | okay do the opposite we were the other |
| 104.56 | 3.84 | 108.40 | way but for display purposes |
| 106.96 | 3.04 | 110.00 | we"ll be here i"m going to use the same |
| 108.40 | 2.64 | 111.04 | setup we"ve been using the reach setup |
| 110.00 | 2.88 | 112.88 | reset up is |
| 111.04 | 3.44 | 114.48 | hyper important when you"re going |
| 112.88 | 3.76 | 116.64 | against a larger opponent |
| 114.48 | 3.60 | 118.08 | he has big strong arms i don"t want to |
| 116.64 | 2.40 | 119.04 | have to deal with them i don"t want to |
| 118.08 | 2.48 | 120.56 | have to touch them |
| 119.04 | 3.60 | 122.64 | so i"m going to clear them out of the |
| 120.56 | 5.60 | 126.16 | way on my entry by reaching |
| 122.64 | 6.40 | 129.04 | retract my elbows and step behind his |
| 126.16 | 4.16 | 130.32 | lead leg i want my post underneath me i |
| 129.04 | 4.00 | 133.04 | can be at his foot |
| 130.32 | 4.56 | 134.88 | behind his foot i can even be slightly |
| 133.04 | 3.60 | 136.64 | in front of his foot but realize |
| 134.88 | 4.40 | 139.28 | that my hands then are going to be over |
| 136.64 | 4.08 | 140.72 | top of my base okay extend it out i want |
| 139.28 | 4.64 | 143.92 | my posts |
| 140.72 | 5.76 | 146.48 | underneath me that"s ideal my lead hand |
| 143.92 | 3.36 | 147.28 | swings underneath my trail hand |
| 146.48 | 3.36 | 149.84 | collapses |
| 147.28 | 4.48 | 151.76 | into a gable grip right underneath i |
| 149.84 | 4.80 | 154.64 | keep my grip at his knee |
| 151.76 | 3.76 | 155.52 | i lace my shoulder over the top right in |
| 154.64 | 3.92 | 158.56 | the crook |
| 155.52 | 3.68 | 159.20 | of his hip right where his femur meets |
| 158.56 | 2.16 | 160.72 | his hip |
| 159.20 | 3.28 | 162.48 | okay this is one of the most common |
| 160.72 | 3.60 | 164.32 | mistakes we"re gonna see bjj guys make |
| 162.48 | 2.16 | 164.64 | they over commit they go elbow to elbow |
| 164.32 | 2.48 | 166.80 | here |
| 164.64 | 3.68 | 168.32 | now look see where my head position is |
| 166.80 | 2.88 | 169.68 | he can easily stuff my head here and |
| 168.32 | 1.92 | 170.24 | start to sprawl making life really hard |
| 169.68 | 2.24 | 171.92 | on me |
| 170.24 | 3.84 | 174.08 | i my head position will never get the |
| 171.92 | 5.28 | 177.20 | length it needs if i go elbow |
| 174.08 | 4.24 | 178.32 | or hand to elbow i go gable grip look |
| 177.20 | 1.68 | 178.88 | how much length that gives me in my |
| 178.32 | 3.36 | 181.68 | shoulder |
| 178.88 | 5.12 | 184.00 | it can reach up to the far to his hip i |
| 181.68 | 3.92 | 185.60 | do not stack my grip |
| 184.00 | 3.12 | 187.12 | right underneath my shoulder and pinch |
| 185.60 | 4.64 | 190.24 | the leg i want to |
| 187.12 | 5.12 | 192.24 | extend down the teeter totter extend |
| 190.24 | 3.12 | 193.36 | down creating leverage here see how my |
| 192.24 | 3.28 | 195.52 | base is underneath me |
| 193.36 | 3.68 | 197.04 | he"s carrying all my weight right here i |
| 195.52 | 2.64 | 198.16 | can hang out here all day there"s very |
| 197.04 | 4.08 | 201.12 | little weight on my legs |
| 198.16 | 4.48 | 202.64 | i"m focusing all my weight into the top |
| 201.12 | 3.12 | 204.24 | of his femur |
| 202.64 | 2.96 | 205.60 | right here my head is up and my |
| 204.24 | 3.12 | 207.36 | shoulders are shrugged avoiding |
| 205.60 | 3.92 | 209.52 | guillotines and bulldog chokes |
| 207.36 | 3.60 | 210.96 | if my head is up if my structure is in |
| 209.52 | 2.00 | 211.52 | place my hand structure and shoulder |
| 210.96 | 4.00 | 214.96 | structure |
| 211.52 | 3.92 | 215.44 | my neck will be safe okay i"m keeping my |
| 214.96 | 2.80 | 217.76 | grip |
| 215.44 | 4.16 | 219.60 | nice and tight my elbows are not flared |
| 217.76 | 4.16 | 221.92 | they"re pulled into my ribs tight |
| 219.60 | 4.00 | 223.60 | i make this leg a part of me i"m pulling |
| 221.92 | 3.36 | 225.28 | my grip in i"m cinching |
| 223.60 | 3.44 | 227.04 | everything in tight and keeping my |
| 225.28 | 4.64 | 229.92 | shoulder laced over top |
| 227.04 | 4.80 | 231.84 | this creates a very tight base now he |
| 229.92 | 4.32 | 234.24 | has to adhere to my body weight |
| 231.84 | 4.88 | 236.72 | when i sag my weight see him go down |
| 234.24 | 4.40 | 238.64 | he"s going to have to come down with me |
| 236.72 | 4.40 | 241.12 | i take one teeny tiny step forward left |
| 238.64 | 4.40 | 243.04 | leg or trail leg |
| 241.12 | 4.00 | 245.12 | one teeny tiny step backwards with my |
| 243.04 | 5.60 | 248.64 | inside leg right leg |
| 245.12 | 3.52 | 248.64 | and then i sit him down |
| 248.96 | 6.16 | 255.12 | so again on my entry i reach |
| 252.40 | 4.80 | 257.20 | protract step deep aiming to get behind |
| 255.12 | 4.96 | 260.08 | his heel or at least at his foot |
| 257.20 | 3.92 | 261.12 | hand wraps around to the knee lace over |
| 260.08 | 3.76 | 263.84 | top |
| 261.12 | 4.24 | 265.36 | stay close we do not hang out here okay |
| 263.84 | 3.44 | 267.28 | this is a transitory position you want |
| 265.36 | 4.24 | 269.60 | to spend as little time here as possible |
| 267.28 | 4.24 | 271.52 | so many bjj practitioners get in here |
| 269.60 | 3.44 | 273.04 | and they they even close their legs this |
| 271.52 | 3.76 | 275.28 | only cements the position |
| 273.04 | 3.52 | 276.56 | this is not this is not a position we |
| 275.28 | 4.08 | 279.36 | hang out in okay |
| 276.56 | 3.68 | 280.24 | i"m only here so i can i want to enter |
| 279.36 | 4.56 | 283.92 | in |
| 280.24 | 6.96 | 287.20 | with my structure already set so |
| 283.92 | 5.12 | 289.04 | i reach i enter my structure set now i |
| 287.20 | 5.04 | 292.24 | just have to step step |
| 289.04 | 3.92 | 292.96 | step step and it"s like he"s riding on a |
| 292.24 | 3.04 | 295.28 | little slide |
| 292.96 | 3.12 | 296.08 | okay it"s like there"s a little 45 |
| 295.28 | 2.72 | 298.00 | degree slide |
| 296.08 | 4.00 | 300.08 | 45 degree angle sloping down to the |
| 298.00 | 4.96 | 302.96 | ground where i"m going to step step |
| 300.08 | 3.76 | 303.84 | pressure down and back human beings |
| 302.96 | 3.36 | 306.32 | aren"t that good at |
| 303.84 | 4.80 | 308.64 | walking backwards especially on one leg |
| 306.32 | 4.00 | 310.32 | okay so i get him on one leg |
| 308.64 | 3.60 | 312.24 | and then i"m going to make him move |
| 310.32 | 5.60 | 315.92 | backwards with pressure |
| 312.24 | 4.96 | 317.20 | moving down to here and i also like to |
| 315.92 | 4.32 | 320.24 | slide out to the ankle |
| 317.20 | 4.80 | 322.00 | right so after i whip him down |
| 320.24 | 3.20 | 323.44 | i release my grip and slide up to the |
| 322.00 | 3.52 | 325.52 | ankle i want to keep |
| 323.44 | 3.84 | 327.28 | i want to keep a hand on him i want to |
| 325.52 | 3.44 | 328.96 | stay connected here okay |
| 327.28 | 3.20 | 330.48 | if i let go of him he has a chance to |
| 328.96 | 3.28 | 332.24 | base up get his feet underneath him so i |
| 330.48 | 3.92 | 334.40 | keep a foot |
| 332.24 | 4.56 | 336.80 | if this is a fight he has a chance to up |
| 334.40 | 4.48 | 338.88 | kick okay if this is bjj he has a chance |
| 336.80 | 3.76 | 340.56 | to try and pull guard so i keep a foot |
| 338.88 | 4.80 | 343.68 | i keep my hand on his ankle slide it out |
| 340.56 | 5.20 | 345.76 | to here and then you can lift and enter |
| 343.68 | 3.04 | 346.72 | any way you want you have options here |
| 345.76 | 5.36 | 351.12 | but |
| 346.72 | 7.60 | 354.32 | keep a hand on one more time |
| 351.12 | 4.24 | 355.36 | and enter with force enter with force |
| 354.32 | 3.92 | 358.24 | here okay |
| 355.36 | 4.40 | 359.76 | your shoulder needs to knock him back |
| 358.24 | 5.12 | 363.36 | you"re aiming for the crook |
| 359.76 | 5.76 | 365.52 | of his hip where his femur meets his hip |
| 363.36 | 4.24 | 367.60 | enter right here see i can knock back on |
| 365.52 | 4.24 | 369.76 | this foot even if he"s a big guy |
| 367.60 | 4.16 | 371.76 | i"m attacking him at a center of gravity |
| 369.76 | 4.72 | 374.48 | with a very acute point in my shoulder |
| 371.76 | 3.84 | 375.60 | here another thing is when guys go hand |
| 374.48 | 3.28 | 377.76 | to elbow |
| 375.60 | 3.44 | 379.04 | they distribute that pressure over a |
| 377.76 | 3.04 | 380.80 | large area of their chest |
| 379.04 | 3.28 | 382.32 | okay that"s not an acute point of |
| 380.80 | 3.36 | 384.16 | pressure i"m distributing that off |
| 382.32 | 4.00 | 386.32 | all throughout his leg especially if |
| 384.16 | 2.72 | 386.88 | he"s a big guy i need to make all my |
| 386.32 | 3.68 | 390.00 | weight |
| 386.88 | 4.56 | 391.44 | count all of my pressure count meaning |
| 390.00 | 3.52 | 393.52 | my shoulder will be much more useful |
| 391.44 | 3.76 | 395.20 | than my chest everything"s pulled in |
| 393.52 | 4.16 | 397.68 | tight my head is up |
| 395.20 | 4.16 | 399.36 | this is not good head position okay guys |
| 397.68 | 3.92 | 401.60 | this is good head position |
| 399.36 | 4.40 | 403.76 | and you see how my shoulders are tilted |
| 401.60 | 4.48 | 406.08 | that gives me even more length to my arm |
| 403.76 | 4.32 | 408.08 | if my shoulders are parallel to the mat |
| 406.08 | 2.72 | 408.80 | you see how this arm gets shorter and |
| 408.08 | 1.84 | 409.92 | now |
| 408.80 | 3.12 | 411.92 | my shoulder is never going to get to |
| 409.92 | 3.12 | 413.04 | where it needs to go so many bjj guys do |
| 411.92 | 2.24 | 414.16 | this they hold on to the leg and they |
| 413.04 | 3.28 | 416.32 | just stand here like this |
| 414.16 | 3.28 | 417.44 | or like this how do you expect to take |
| 416.32 | 2.24 | 418.56 | anybody down |
| 417.44 | 3.28 | 420.72 | you need to create you need to give him |
| 418.56 | 4.08 | 422.64 | a reason to go down need to give him |
| 420.72 | 4.32 | 425.04 | pressure on his leg to go down |
| 422.64 | 3.12 | 425.76 | lace that shoulder over top pull that |
| 425.04 | 3.92 | 428.96 | knee in |
| 425.76 | 12.08 | 437.84 | step step sit down |
| 428.96 | 8.88 | 437.84 | slide out to the angle |
| 448.84 | 16.36 | 465.20 | so |
| 450.88 | 14.32 | 465.20 | that"s good yep |

one of the most common questions i get is what's the number one takedown what's the best takedown in grappling if you're a bjj guy it's kind of like asking what's the best way to pass if you're a striker it's kind of like being asked what's the best punch it's a hard question you need two three four ways to create offense and then circling between those offenses generally opens one of them up but if i had a gun in my head absolutely had to answer no it would be the single leg okay why the single leg the single leg narrows the fight down to a very small corridor you're using your entire body to attack one of your opponent's appendages so it's not only effective in attacking a smaller or same size opponent but a larger opponent it's a technique that's largely dependent upon leverage and positioning in angles it has less to do with power it does take a little longer to learn it's not as accessible as our double legs that's why i prioritize our double legs they teach you how to cover distance in a quicker way so then when you go to learn the single leg it's more easily absorbed so if i'm facing a larger opponent this is the real utility of the single leg if i'm up against a larger opponent and i'm planning on hitting a double leg it's highly unlikely that i'm going to be able to if i'm an inexperienced grappler that italian like i'd be able to power through his size okay there's a great size and power disparity so using a power and explosive dependent offense is a bad idea that's why i favor the single leg that's why the single leg has such great utility because it will cover and be effective against nearly the most effective takedown against every one of your opponents it our lead leg is dependent upon our opponent's lead leg so frey has his left foot forward that means my right foot has to be forward for my entry to be successful okay do the opposite we were the other way but for display purposes we'll be here i'm going to use the same setup we've been using the reach setup reset up is hyper important when you're going against a larger opponent he has big strong arms i don't want to have to deal with them i don't want to have to touch them so i'm going to clear them out of the way on my entry by reaching retract my elbows and step behind his lead leg i want my post underneath me i can be at his foot behind his foot i can even be slightly in front of his foot but realize that my hands then are going to be over top of my base okay extend it out i want my posts underneath me that's ideal my lead hand swings underneath my trail hand collapses into a gable grip right underneath i keep my grip at his knee i lace my shoulder over the top right in the crook of his hip right where his femur meets his hip okay this is one of the most common mistakes we're gonna see bjj guys make they over commit they go elbow to elbow here now look see where my head position is he can easily stuff my head here and start to sprawl making life really hard on me i my head position will never get the length it needs if i go elbow or hand to elbow i go gable grip look how much length that gives me in my shoulder it can reach up to the far to his hip i do not stack my grip right underneath my shoulder and pinch the leg i want to extend down the teeter totter extend down creating leverage here see how my base is underneath me he's carrying all my weight right here i can hang out here all day there's very little weight on my legs i'm focusing all my weight into the top of his femur right here my head is up and my shoulders are shrugged avoiding guillotines and bulldog chokes if my head is up if my structure is in place my hand structure and shoulder structure my neck will be safe okay i'm keeping my grip nice and tight my elbows are not flared they're pulled into my ribs tight i make this leg a part of me i'm pulling my grip in i'm cinching everything in tight and keeping my shoulder laced over top this creates a very tight base now he has to adhere to my body weight when i sag my weight see him go down he's going to have to come down with me i take one teeny tiny step forward left leg or trail leg one teeny tiny step backwards with my inside leg right leg and then i sit him down so again on my entry i reach protract step deep aiming to get behind his heel or at least at his foot hand wraps around to the knee lace over top stay close we do not hang out here okay this is a transitory position you want to spend as little time here as possible so many bjj practitioners get in here and they they even close their legs this only cements the position this is not this is not a position we hang out in okay i'm only here so i can i want to enter in with my structure already set so i reach i enter my structure set now i just have to step step step step and it's like he's riding on a little slide okay it's like there's a little 45 degree slide 45 degree angle sloping down to the ground where i'm going to step step pressure down and back human beings aren't that good at walking backwards especially on one leg okay so i get him on one leg and then i'm going to make him move backwards with pressure moving down to here and i also like to slide out to the ankle right so after i whip him down i release my grip and slide up to the ankle i want to keep i want to keep a hand on him i want to stay connected here okay if i let go of him he has a chance to base up get his feet underneath him so i keep a foot if this is a fight he has a chance to up kick okay if this is bjj he has a chance to try and pull guard so i keep a foot i keep my hand on his ankle slide it out to here and then you can lift and enter any way you want you have options here but keep a hand on one more time and enter with force enter with force here okay your shoulder needs to knock him back you're aiming for the crook of his hip where his femur meets his hip enter right here see i can knock back on this foot even if he's a big guy i'm attacking him at a center of gravity with a very acute point in my shoulder here another thing is when guys go hand to elbow they distribute that pressure over a large area of their chest okay that's not an acute point of pressure i'm distributing that off all throughout his leg especially if he's a big guy i need to make all my weight count all of my pressure count meaning my shoulder will be much more useful than my chest everything's pulled in tight my head is up this is not good head position okay guys this is good head position and you see how my shoulders are tilted that gives me even more length to my arm if my shoulders are parallel to the mat you see how this arm gets shorter and now my shoulder is never going to get to where it needs to go so many bjj guys do this they hold on to the leg and they just stand here like this or like this how do you expect to take anybody down you need to create you need to give him a reason to go down need to give him pressure on his leg to go down lace that shoulder over top pull that knee in step step sit down slide out to the angle so that's good yep
