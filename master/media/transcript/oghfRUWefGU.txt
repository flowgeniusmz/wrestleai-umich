rolling with the Triple C imma make him bend the knee rolling with the Triple C don't really count the heat what's up everybody Henderson here AKA Triple C and welcome to this episode of fight feedback that's right the wrestling Edition guys the world championship is going on right now September 16th to the 24th we getting the best of the best the best rosters in the world and on this episode of wrestling feedback I'm going to be breaking down David Taylor and Yaz Donnie Guys these are two former Olympic and World Champion these are two guys that are going against country against country Iran versus the United States with the record Being 4-1 for David Taylor but when it comes to 2021 till now they're officially one and one guys I'm here to break down these fights and I'm here to break down these damn wrestling matches to see who is this gonna more likely come on up top I'm gonna give keys for both so anyhow guys enough talk let's take it to the big screen and here we have it Yaz Dani versus David Taylor the world championships the 2021 World Championships where yazdani was the victor you know the one thing I will say about this match watching this match yes Danny did a really good job with two things pressure under hook and getting David Taylor to go backwards because as you as you guys know as a David Taylor fan if you get David Taylor to kind of start moving he starts getting his Groove that's actually where he gets better but yes Donny you know being being uh 3-0 against him at this time he was like man I want to get this this is this was the Olympic finals by the way this is the first time that they wrestled after the Olympic finals so right away starting off with the starting off with the underhook and then pressing David Taylor getting David Taylor just getting them off his game even just going even just trying to grab that leg and he continues with the pressure you know it seems like he's like his feet are underneath him he's not bent like he's almost like upright and that's where I feel like stabbed alive could do a really good job he's moving him yo to eventually get us one like starting off the wrestling match fast like typically typically these guys it takes them a minute to actually get going but within the 35 second mark this dude's already he's already on he's already on the scoreboard but again on the on the underhook and notice the outside tie too you know uses pressure as its Force brings them dies in a press back into them to again score again you know back to that underhook him finding that underhook again was uh was key in this in this fight and it's weird because Yaz Diana rustles everybody almost kind of like the same he uses the underhook a lot but with David Taylor David Taylor in the past has been able to control him through the collar ties but notice how many there's about you know we're about you know close to two minutes down and notice how many times how many pools that that yazdani has done to Taylor including another one and how much he's invested in actually fatiguing him because the more you pull you know what happens guys you take the legs out and you fatigue the back and when you fatigue that you slowly it's like somebody that kicks so it's like in fighting if somebody kicks he breaks your foundation and when somebody puts pressure and knows how to pull you and right away his feet are Underneath Him it's an investment notice how many times he's dunked them so far like these little small little details on top of him using an underhook and obviously making him wrestle I mean think about it this is these are tactics I mean magic mine four-time NCAA finalists two-time NCAA champ uh Olympic and World Champ and it's the small little details of what y'all's done is again pulling them dunking him I can't emphasize that enough because I want you guys to know why it is that yazdani ended up becoming Victorious look at it look at his upright stats too and he's probably gonna grab a hold of something and then start pulling him again but right now obviously with 15 seconds left like he's probably just holding on to you know holding off to the lead snapping pulling first period for yazdani did a good job of pressing he did a good job of of of getting the underhook and then obviously pulling them uh to the edge to eventually get two ones which right now he's in the lead two to zero it's important who you have in your corner you know Casey uh Cunningham you know one of uh you know one of the best coaches right now in the United States and obviously yasdani where wrestling is King out in uh out in Iran I went to Iran in 2007 and I went back to in 2011 they treated me like a king I mean God after anywhere else other than Brazil or Mexico I'd probably love to move to Iran just to be Kingman eat all the dates I can you know and it seems and not now you notice the urgency and David telling the beginning of this of this first of this second period he's trying to control a caller and yazdani yes Danny's going back to uh he's kind of holding his ground but you guys may not see nothing much going on but all those little pools that yazdani has has hit on David Taylor including with the underhook it's it's there's two that's two takedowns now the simple fact that David Taylor kind of got aggressive now he's down four to zero I mean when it comes to the world championship level when you're down that much it's like dude against the best defensive guys in the world it makes it super hard yeah yeah it seems like y'all's Danny's just standing his ground there like nothing much he's on a four-point lead he's on a four-point lead and beautiful oof I don't know how he slipped there but whatever that may be yesterday did a really good really good job defensively I I think this referee awarded two points but ended up being nothing you know I might have just been a slip um but I do think that that's one error that maybe yazdani may be looking to crotch slip in the future yeah if you notice David Taylor he's not moving his feet he's he you know like he's he's getting into the web of yasdani of that caller time like this is this this is unaware yazdani wants to be with you he wants to be in in the uh in the car type position the over under if you're not moving you know a minute minute minute 10 left you know Taylor's urgency yep finally took a risk finally took a risk penetrated ended up getting the takedown yeah good luck turning these Iranians man these Iranians are some of the most some of the strongest wrestlers that you guys will ever come across like these dudes like their strength is absolutely these strongest guys pound for pound that I've ever fought wrestled box whatever whatever that may be is the Iranians yeah right now it seems like David Taylor's just going just trying to shoot it's like I think that's why it's important to develop other like arm drags and things of that nature it's not it shouldn't just be taked out especially when you're down this is why it's important to develop an inside trip uh a funky front headlock and just and just to secure it he turns around and gets us too I mean great win I think the reason why y'alls don't even won that fight you have any idea how much that means to him he's been three and zero this time is at the world championships the 2021 World Championships and he finally gets the victory ain't that crazy but how is it that he won that first match it was tactical it had nothing to do with technique it had to do with with this pressure with this underhooks with this ability to get these cheap points they don't want to call them cheap but they're they are cheap points where he was able to make it into a six to two match again super impressive great competitors it doesn't get like no more high level than that so here we have it you know the world championships and Belgrade this was last year 2022. now I want you guys to see the adjustments that David Taylor ended up making like you know what I mean he's now he's moving his feet a little bit more he's controlling the call like he's making sure he's making that initiation and and guess who's pulling a little bit more David Taylor David Taylor you can tell you I was dying trying to kind of pushed the pace but you can tell David Taylor his stats was a little upright he wasn't so dunk this time around and he's kind of holding his ground he said I'm saying boom call outside like all those all those little pools guys it fatigues again it fatigues the legs it fatigues the lower back but the inside control and notice that he's not with both hands like he was the the mess that he actually lost if he was call attack his call time with one and he's called time with two but but notice he's either grabbing a wrist but he's on the car tie he's not he's not wrapped up he's not getting into yazdani's game kind of finding distance he wasn't head to head like he was with him the first time around if you guys noticed that Head to Head where his his head is on his head then there he goes he's kind of laying a fly a little bit taking a little bit of chances he'll he'll he'll do certain things off of collar ties that he was able to take from four-time NCAA champ Olympic champion Kel Sanderson but notice he's controlling the tie he's not allowing yazdani to get that inside control he's not allowing he's not giving him the underhook and we're going we're going down to about two uh two minutes down you know he you can tell when a fighter kind of comes up to his feet a little too high that he's a little he's a little uh bothered oof notice that re-attack can we go back oh beautiful notice that reattack as he goes look look at how look at his redirection it's able to find it one more time notice he shoots he counters and then look he's looking for he's looking for history attack beautiful he didn't get it but then now watch he got him to fight you but he get to take down once again he got him back to see they had already scrambled and Shred up one outside single see able to get the takedown God I'm thinking I'm gonna hand fight you to eventually look for the takedown these are these are tactical these are these are tactical things that people don't see fight them fight and fight them act like you're gonna fight him level change get the takedown yeah David Taylor 2-1 2-1 but it seems like if you notice David did not go tie to tie with them right away if he was going tie to tie with him right away he was he was he was one that was controlling that that inside tie which is different and guess what that that second take that he ended up getting you know why he got it because he already made him wrestle and the more he made him wrestled he made him think wrestling eventually getting that level change so that she get the takedown I mean talk about a rivalry like that like this might be one of the biggest rivalries in in wrestling history yeah but if you notice yazdani now he's trying to change the pace of the fight like like he's pressing he's you know he's trying to make him wrestle right away because he's no he knows that if he can get David Taylor off of his game then he can do it but notice this time around he wasn't under hooking he almost you almost wonder why like it's almost like he didn't even attempt it like everything that he was doing was just all caller we're in the first match he was that's how he was done and was doing was just under hooking him underhooking him all right you can you can can you guys notice the the difference in the from the from the time he has done he did win until now standing up in the air looking him looking up he's gonna get taken down you know and obviously the the corrections that David Taylor Made you know that's one under hook see he's getting back like the under hooks there and then again same shot that he just caught him with made him compete made him get over aggressive let's reset that I made it complete boom and then it goes again it's almost like he goes to this far side or he fakes The Far Side one last time I want you guys to see he made him compete goes to that Far Side makes three far side but his head Comes This Way you see what I'm saying it's almost like it's very slick because he like reaches but it's like it's a misdirection that's twice in this match that he's caught him with yeah right now it's 4-1 David Taylor has an amazing lead you know he has a great lead plus one add one it's almost like these both these guys the way the way they were able to get get each other it was almost kind of the same thing but a different style like the same tactical points but just different styles yeah trying to misdirection does he get it yeah oh yeah David Taylor did not want to give that and I don't I don't I don't think he does I think it's the Battle of uh beautiful beautiful scramble you know beautiful beautiful scramble by David Taylor oh oh beautiful notice that that's true why not notice what yazdan is doing he's trying to go this way that way and then finally he gave David Taylor that angle in order for him to get that that take down you know what he was trying to do was trying to shuck this to it one last time so he's trying to go this way trying to shuck him the other way he's going that way and when he comes this way look he gives his angle and this is what David till he's able to get to take down you know it's almost like he probably should have snapped him again rather than going that way because then you have takedowns I mean that's seven that's seven two one talk about somebody who just made adjustments that's crazy I have going going for the underhook a little too late yeah seven one talk about somebody who just made an adjustment talk about a rivalry a real rivalry between David Taylor and Yaz Donnie man this fight this wrestling match was just it's out of control so the keys for Yaz Dani hassayas Dani to win he needs to get his Temple going pressure and underhooks that's the number one thing that I saw uh according to their fight in the 20 20 then the 2021 worlds as he was able to make Taylor fight his B-side how through pressure and under hooks it was the pressure game and the underhooks two is tactics there's a lot of cheap points that he ended again but they're not when I say cheap I'm not saying necessarily cheap but there are like simple points that people don't look that yazdani was able to get I'm talking about those damn push-ups I'm talking about those push-ups because there's two of them when you're up four to zero against somebody man that's a big lead and somebody will somebody will try to go for a broke because they know they're down by four so again guys the biggest thing uh um the tactics are are going to be a big key for a guy like Yaz Danny and for the third key for yazdani is the biggest thing is right here can he get his spirit filled in 2021 you knew that he was just sick of David Taylor and he literally wanted beat him but can he get his momentum and inspiration can he be inspired like he was in 2021 2022 it looked like he took it back he took a back step but is he able to use his pressure with his underhooks tactically wrestle a guy like David Taylor get those cheap points and then three could he use his momentum and his inspiration how he carries Iran on his back in order for him to get the victory and now the three keys for David Taylor my biggest thing is there's a reason why they call him the magic man he moves great on his feet he gets his movement going I think that's the biggest thing that's really gonna help uh David Taylor against a wrestling match against shazdani is going to be his movement his movement when you get a bull like Yas dying likes to honor her the likes of pressure likes to pull can you not get him to catch you I think the biggest thing is this movement number two is his feet he needs to move his feet to set up his takedowns yeah she's my French but can he can he use the movement to move his feet to eventually get the takedowns and the third one is is what he did before can he play The Matador can he use a lot of that tactical sense against a guy like Yaz Dani his Tactics get him to pressure get him to pressure to be able to actually get the takedown so for David Taylor his movement his Groove the magic that he brings to the table's number one key number two can he move his feet can he frustrate a guy like Yaz Dani to be able to set traps tactically to be able to get those takedowns we saw the match we saw the last match and we saw how it was that he did so this is the breakdown guys the only thing that I could tell you guys really that this wrestling match is going to be fire absolutely fireworks World Olympic champ and you can only watch it on uww plus yup that's right I said it uww plus so you guys make sure to download that because the World Championships on September 16th to the
