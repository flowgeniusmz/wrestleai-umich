| 0.00 | 4.26 | 4.26 | first thing we"re going to talk about |
| 0.96 | 5.16 | 6.12 | today is our five lines of defense |
| 4.26 | 3.36 | 7.62 | okay the I know there is a lot of |
| 6.12 | 4.02 | 10.14 | different theories on this and every |
| 7.62 | 4.32 | 11.94 | coach has their their own idea and their |
| 10.14 | 4.29 | 14.43 | own concepts on how that should be |
| 11.94 | 4.83 | 16.77 | approached and I"m here today to share |
| 14.43 | 3.63 | 18.06 | with you what I think in my opinion and |
| 16.77 | 3.75 | 20.52 | what I found successful through my |
| 18.06 | 4.50 | 22.56 | journey to my my my Olympic journey so |
| 20.52 | 4.41 | 24.93 | far and my coaching journey as well okay |
| 22.56 | 4.68 | 27.24 | five lines of defense here"s what we"re |
| 24.93 | 5.25 | 30.18 | starting with number one to me the most |
| 27.24 | 5.91 | 33.15 | important thing is using our heads right |
| 30.18 | 5.79 | 35.97 | told him fighting after all a lot of if |
| 33.15 | 4.71 | 37.86 | you watch a lot of high-level wrestlers |
| 35.97 | 3.75 | 39.72 | you"re going to see that they won"t |
| 37.86 | 4.14 | 42.00 | immediately to make contact with your |
| 39.72 | 4.56 | 44.28 | opponent so they can feel where they"re |
| 42.00 | 3.09 | 45.09 | going what they"re doing so there are no |
| 44.28 | 3.27 | 47.55 | surprises |
| 45.09 | 5.19 | 50.28 | while we wrestle okay so when we |
| 47.55 | 4.74 | 52.29 | understand as soon as we shake hands and |
| 50.28 | 3.99 | 54.27 | as soon as the match begins I mean if |
| 52.29 | 3.69 | 55.98 | you want to put my hand on him okay |
| 54.27 | 3.90 | 58.17 | whether it"s on the head whether it"s on |
| 55.98 | 4.71 | 60.69 | the shoulder usually the hand it"s the |
| 58.17 | 4.02 | 62.19 | closest thing to me right so as soon as |
| 60.69 | 5.91 | 66.60 | we shake hands I want to put my hand on |
| 62.19 | 6.12 | 68.31 | his head now the way I explain this with |
| 66.60 | 3.42 | 70.02 | with with when I first started teaching |
| 68.31 | 3.45 | 71.76 | this okay one the way I explain this |
| 70.02 | 3.21 | 73.23 | with even with little kids okay I |
| 71.76 | 3.33 | 75.09 | coached some seventeen eight year old |
| 73.23 | 4.44 | 77.67 | kids and I start teaching them this and |
| 75.09 | 4.95 | 80.04 | the first thing that I the the first |
| 77.67 | 4.62 | 82.29 | thing I used to compare this to is this |
| 80.04 | 4.47 | 84.51 | okay for others can"t right and what |
| 82.29 | 3.93 | 86.22 | about star wrestling and if I were to |
| 84.51 | 5.94 | 90.45 | close my eyes and I can"t see anything |
| 86.22 | 7.44 | 93.66 | okay now will I be able to feel what |
| 90.45 | 4.83 | 95.28 | he"s doing where he"s going and where |
| 93.66 | 3.66 | 97.32 | he"s attacking me from he"s he lowering |
| 95.28 | 4.20 | 99.48 | his level he"s he"s standing up what"s |
| 97.32 | 4.23 | 101.55 | happening right if I close mine I would |
| 99.48 | 4.71 | 104.19 | have no idea where he"s going right I |
| 101.55 | 6.42 | 107.97 | can I"ll be completely lost I"ll end up |
| 104.19 | 5.79 | 109.98 | getting blast double you know outside of |
| 107.97 | 4.35 | 112.32 | the man okay so what I wanted to do is I |
| 109.98 | 4.65 | 114.63 | immediately want to put my hands on it |
| 112.32 | 4.11 | 116.43 | and this is the the comparison I use |
| 114.63 | 4.92 | 119.55 | okay if I put one finger on his head |
| 116.43 | 5.88 | 122.31 | only one finger okay and I close my eyes |
| 119.55 | 5.07 | 124.62 | now okay and I"m gonna have jr. move |
| 122.31 | 4.50 | 126.81 | when I close my eyes and see if I can |
| 124.62 | 3.72 | 128.34 | feel what he"s doing where he"s going |
| 126.81 | 5.03 | 131.84 | okay so I"ll close my eyes and I"m at |
| 128.34 | 3.50 | 131.84 | one finger on them okay so move slow |
| 132.32 | 3.46 | 135.78 | [Music] |
| 136.86 | 5.26 | 142.12 | okay as you can see I have a lot better |
| 140.32 | 4.02 | 144.34 | of an idea of where he"s gone and that"s |
| 142.12 | 5.70 | 147.82 | with my eyes closed right imagine if I |
| 144.34 | 5.10 | 149.44 | can see and have an feel right now we"re |
| 147.82 | 3.90 | 151.72 | using two senses that are very very |
| 149.44 | 4.65 | 154.09 | important then it"s gonna be a lot less |
| 151.72 | 4.62 | 156.34 | surprise here okay he"s not gonna be |
| 154.09 | 4.62 | 158.71 | able to surprise me I"m gonna feel exact |
| 156.34 | 4.62 | 160.96 | and see exactly where he"s going and my |
| 158.71 | 5.28 | 163.99 | chances of being surprised here by him |
| 160.96 | 5.31 | 166.27 | on a lot lot less right there slim slim |
| 163.99 | 4.32 | 168.31 | okay so again we"re gonna be understand |
| 166.27 | 3.51 | 169.78 | foot first thing that we"re gonna do as |
| 168.31 | 3.03 | 171.34 | soon as we shake Kent I want to touch |
| 169.78 | 4.35 | 174.13 | okay |
| 171.34 | 5.61 | 176.95 | I"m gonna text with one hand touch right |
| 174.13 | 6.30 | 180.43 | here what is this one or this one okay |
| 176.95 | 6.00 | 182.95 | now step number two line of defense |
| 180.43 | 4.47 | 184.90 | number two if you were to beat my hand |
| 182.95 | 4.65 | 187.60 | okay and there"s couple ways you can do |
| 184.90 | 5.79 | 190.69 | that he can snap or he can peel right |
| 187.60 | 5.76 | 193.36 | the foot here he can snap peel yeah son |
| 190.69 | 5.64 | 196.33 | okay so snap number one right he can |
| 193.36 | 5.12 | 198.48 | peel right whatever it may be doesn"t |
| 196.33 | 4.98 | 201.31 | really matter as soon as he does that I |
| 198.48 | 4.12 | 202.60 | still want to have contact with him so |
| 201.31 | 2.85 | 204.16 | what I"m going to do is my number two |
| 202.60 | 3.90 | 206.50 | line of defense I needed him to close |
| 204.16 | 4.17 | 208.33 | the gap and go forehead to forehead with |
| 206.50 | 4.59 | 211.09 | him I"m gonna use my head as the second |
| 208.33 | 4.92 | 213.25 | line of defense and offensive mmm okay |
| 211.09 | 4.20 | 215.29 | so we"re here the peels immediately |
| 213.25 | 3.54 | 216.79 | closed in and now I can feel him with my |
| 215.29 | 3.45 | 218.74 | head and it"s on Kent fighting down here |
| 216.79 | 4.83 | 221.62 | trying to free my own right I"m gonna |
| 218.74 | 7.59 | 226.33 | use my head okay now step number three |
| 221.62 | 6.99 | 228.61 | arms imagine he beat step number one I |
| 226.33 | 4.50 | 230.83 | closely get the distance the gap okay |
| 228.61 | 3.57 | 232.18 | and he beats step number two and now |
| 230.83 | 3.48 | 234.31 | he"s trying to get it I"m gonna use my |
| 232.18 | 3.96 | 236.14 | arms immediately to block okay |
| 234.31 | 5.19 | 239.50 | what did it"s under when I go under the |
| 236.14 | 5.25 | 241.39 | hook when I closed here whatever it may |
| 239.50 | 3.42 | 242.92 | be my artists Lee gonna get immediately |
| 241.39 | 4.55 | 245.94 | in the way he"s gonna have to get |
| 242.92 | 6.30 | 249.22 | through my arms to get in on me okay |
| 245.94 | 5.41 | 251.35 | step number four kiss we"re gonna use |
| 249.22 | 5.84 | 255.06 | their hips there"s two ways we can use |
| 251.35 | 5.52 | 256.87 | their hips okay step number one in |
| 255.06 | 3.94 | 259.00 | depending on what you"ve been taught |
| 256.87 | 4.44 | 261.31 | right depending on what your defenses |
| 259.00 | 4.92 | 263.92 | one guys get to your legs right a lot of |
| 261.31 | 3.54 | 264.85 | those sort of put a stop to sprawl you |
| 263.92 | 3.30 | 267.22 | know |
| 264.85 | 4.68 | 269.53 | as fast as you can sprawl heavy hips |
| 267.22 | 3.96 | 271.18 | shoelaces on the map right because |
| 269.53 | 3.96 | 273.49 | that"s the easiest concept to understand |
| 271.18 | 3.90 | 275.08 | just getting away from them right but |
| 273.49 | 4.59 | 278.08 | sometimes actually it"s more effective |
| 275.08 | 4.68 | 279.76 | to to face him to kill the momentum just |
| 278.08 | 3.84 | 281.92 | feed him the hips is what I call it this |
| 279.76 | 4.80 | 284.56 | so since he"s getting in we hit with the |
| 281.92 | 4.62 | 286.54 | hips to kill the momentum and then |
| 284.56 | 3.75 | 288.31 | wind-ups problem ok it"s gonna be a lot |
| 286.54 | 3.78 | 290.32 | harder for him to follow and stay with |
| 288.31 | 4.65 | 292.96 | me so here"s what this looks like the |
| 290.32 | 5.58 | 295.90 | killer momentum and sprawl case well if |
| 292.96 | 5.52 | 298.48 | he"s shooting just go ahead and shoot |
| 295.90 | 4.74 | 300.64 | the same a high crotch ok from this |
| 298.48 | 2.67 | 301.15 | thing yeah I"m going to kill little man |
| 300.64 | 2.28 | 302.92 | ok |
| 301.15 | 3.66 | 304.81 | feeling the hips and then immediately |
| 302.92 | 6.00 | 308.92 | number to kill more and there"s no |
| 304.81 | 6.39 | 311.20 | problem ok it"s gonna be a lot harder |
| 308.92 | 4.05 | 312.97 | for him to drag through when I killed |
| 311.20 | 3.96 | 315.16 | that initial initial momentum that |
| 312.97 | 6.63 | 319.60 | initial momentum forward that he"s got |
| 315.16 | 7.20 | 322.36 | going ok so again step number one we |
| 319.60 | 4.92 | 324.52 | shake camps with post he beats that |
| 322.36 | 4.71 | 327.07 | somehow simply were to close the gap is |
| 324.52 | 4.95 | 329.47 | where hand fighting here ok if you were |
| 327.07 | 5.40 | 332.47 | to shoot step number three use my arms |
| 329.47 | 5.22 | 334.69 | right use my lungs to get in the way if |
| 332.47 | 4.20 | 336.67 | she beats my own somehow they get out ok |
| 334.69 | 4.59 | 339.28 | chill little man I"m gonna step number |
| 336.67 | 7.58 | 344.25 | four sprawl ok |
| 339.28 | 7.95 | 347.23 | and step number 5 now is tricks moves |
| 344.25 | 5.35 | 349.60 | technique anything that we got there |
| 347.23 | 5.16 | 352.39 | that you"ve been taught with coming to |
| 349.60 | 6.03 | 355.63 | play now on step number five ok so again |
| 352.39 | 4.62 | 357.01 | the 5 steps are step number one once you |
| 355.63 | 2.94 | 358.57 | in your sense you"re gonna use your |
| 357.01 | 3.93 | 360.94 | hands okay you"re gonna touch |
| 358.57 | 3.84 | 362.41 | immediately ok that way you have to |
| 360.94 | 3.90 | 364.84 | sensitive to you using not just your |
| 362.41 | 4.17 | 366.58 | eyes right we"re feeling as well step |
| 364.84 | 3.75 | 368.59 | number two we"re gonna use our head |
| 366.58 | 3.96 | 370.54 | we"re gonna block with her forehead okay |
| 368.59 | 3.57 | 372.16 | we"re gonna get really strong here we"re |
| 370.54 | 3.57 | 374.11 | gonna use their forehead to block and |
| 372.16 | 4.20 | 376.36 | follow where he"s going you know we"re |
| 374.11 | 4.20 | 378.31 | gonna mirror his his stance if he"s |
| 376.36 | 3.21 | 379.57 | lowering we"re gonna lowered with him if |
| 378.31 | 2.73 | 381.04 | she"s going on the Left we go over the |
| 379.57 | 3.21 | 382.78 | left if he"s gonna ride with the right |
| 381.04 | 4.41 | 385.45 | we"re always blocking with her head |
| 382.78 | 5.36 | 388.14 | number three our arms we"re gonna use |
| 385.45 | 5.40 | 390.85 | our arms to stop him getting away block |
| 388.14 | 5.08 | 393.22 | however we can okay step number four |
| 390.85 | 5.07 | 395.92 | chips we"re gonna feed him the hips kill |
| 393.22 | 3.68 | 396.90 | the momentum sprawl and hopefully we"ll |
| 395.92 | 3.29 | 399.21 | beat him there with |
| 396.90 | 3.87 | 400.77 | fallout of defense and if not he"s super |
| 399.21 | 3.87 | 403.08 | strong right he"s done a super good job |
| 400.77 | 3.99 | 404.76 | of setting up his shop getting in and |
| 403.08 | 3.20 | 406.28 | squeezing and driving through we"re |
| 404.76 | 4.91 | 409.67 | gonna use our step number five which is |
| 406.28 | 7.24 | 413.52 | technique tricks anything that we know |
| 409.67 | 6.58 | 416.25 | as far as skill set goes for defense |
| 413.52 | 6.23 | 419.75 | okay I hope that makes sense and let"s |
| 416.25 | 3.50 | 419.75 | go on to what"s next |
| 425.62 | 2.06 | 427.68 | you |

## Transcript Text
first thing we're going to talk about today is our five lines of defense okay the I know there is a lot of different theories on this and every coach has their their own idea and their own concepts on how that should be approached and I'm here today to share with you what I think in my opinion and what I found successful through my journey to my my my Olympic journey so far and my coaching journey as well okay five lines of defense here's what we're starting with number one to me the most important thing is using our heads right told him fighting after all a lot of if you watch a lot of high-level wrestlers you're going to see that they won't immediately to make contact with your opponent so they can feel where they're going what they're doing so there are no surprises while we wrestle okay so when we understand as soon as we shake hands and as soon as the match begins I mean if you want to put my hand on him okay whether it's on the head whether it's on the shoulder usually the hand it's the closest thing to me right so as soon as we shake hands I want to put my hand on his head now the way I explain this with with with when I first started teaching this okay one the way I explain this with even with little kids okay I coached some seventeen eight year old kids and I start teaching them this and the first thing that I the the first thing I used to compare this to is this okay for others can't right and what about star wrestling and if I were to close my eyes and I can't see anything okay now will I be able to feel what he's doing where he's going and where he's attacking me from he's he lowering his level he's he's standing up what's happening right if I close mine I would have no idea where he's going right I can I'll be completely lost I'll end up getting blast double you know outside of the man okay so what I wanted to do is I immediately want to put my hands on it and this is the the comparison I use okay if I put one finger on his head only one finger okay and I close my eyes now okay and I'm gonna have jr. move when I close my eyes and see if I can feel what he's doing where he's going okay so I'll close my eyes and I'm at one finger on them okay so move slow [Music] okay as you can see I have a lot better of an idea of where he's gone and that's with my eyes closed right imagine if I can see and have an feel right now we're using two senses that are very very important then it's gonna be a lot less surprise here okay he's not gonna be able to surprise me I'm gonna feel exact and see exactly where he's going and my chances of being surprised here by him on a lot lot less right there slim slim okay so again we're gonna be understand foot first thing that we're gonna do as soon as we shake Kent I want to touch okay I'm gonna text with one hand touch right here what is this one or this one okay now step number two line of defense number two if you were to beat my hand okay and there's couple ways you can do that he can snap or he can peel right the foot here he can snap peel yeah son okay so snap number one right he can peel right whatever it may be doesn't really matter as soon as he does that I still want to have contact with him so what I'm going to do is my number two line of defense I needed him to close the gap and go forehead to forehead with him I'm gonna use my head as the second line of defense and offensive mmm okay so we're here the peels immediately closed in and now I can feel him with my head and it's on Kent fighting down here trying to free my own right I'm gonna use my head okay now step number three arms imagine he beat step number one I closely get the distance the gap okay and he beats step number two and now he's trying to get it I'm gonna use my arms immediately to block okay what did it's under when I go under the hook when I closed here whatever it may be my artists Lee gonna get immediately in the way he's gonna have to get through my arms to get in on me okay step number four kiss we're gonna use their hips there's two ways we can use their hips okay step number one in depending on what you've been taught right depending on what your defenses one guys get to your legs right a lot of those sort of put a stop to sprawl you know as fast as you can sprawl heavy hips shoelaces on the map right because that's the easiest concept to understand just getting away from them right but sometimes actually it's more effective to to face him to kill the momentum just feed him the hips is what I call it this so since he's getting in we hit with the hips to kill the momentum and then wind-ups problem ok it's gonna be a lot harder for him to follow and stay with me so here's what this looks like the killer momentum and sprawl case well if he's shooting just go ahead and shoot the same a high crotch ok from this thing yeah I'm going to kill little man ok feeling the hips and then immediately number to kill more and there's no problem ok it's gonna be a lot harder for him to drag through when I killed that initial initial momentum that initial momentum forward that he's got going ok so again step number one we shake camps with post he beats that somehow simply were to close the gap is where hand fighting here ok if you were to shoot step number three use my arms right use my lungs to get in the way if she beats my own somehow they get out ok chill little man I'm gonna step number four sprawl ok and step number 5 now is tricks moves technique anything that we got there that you've been taught with coming to play now on step number five ok so again the 5 steps are step number one once you in your sense you're gonna use your hands okay you're gonna touch immediately ok that way you have to sensitive to you using not just your eyes right we're feeling as well step number two we're gonna use our head we're gonna block with her forehead okay we're gonna get really strong here we're gonna use their forehead to block and follow where he's going you know we're gonna mirror his his stance if he's lowering we're gonna lowered with him if she's going on the Left we go over the left if he's gonna ride with the right we're always blocking with her head number three our arms we're gonna use our arms to stop him getting away block however we can okay step number four chips we're gonna feed him the hips kill the momentum sprawl and hopefully we'll beat him there with fallout of defense and if not he's super strong right he's done a super good job of setting up his shop getting in and squeezing and driving through we're gonna use our step number five which is technique tricks anything that we know as far as skill set goes for defense okay I hope that makes sense and let's go on to what's next you
