| 9.42 | 2.70 | 12.12 | okay |
| 10.26 | 4.38 | 14.64 | something important before you do a |
| 12.12 | 4.50 | 16.62 | regular penetration step now you"re in |
| 14.64 | 4.32 | 18.96 | your stance right here near wrestling |
| 16.62 | 4.80 | 21.42 | stance however you like to stand square |
| 18.96 | 4.05 | 23.01 | dance I like a little bit of staggered |
| 21.42 | 4.44 | 25.86 | stance it definitely sends him about |
| 23.01 | 4.62 | 27.63 | more for a penetration step we"re square |
| 25.86 | 3.50 | 29.36 | stance may set you up later for a lunge |
| 27.63 | 6.48 | 34.11 | step but we"re gonna get into that later |
| 29.36 | 6.25 | 35.61 | right now before you take any shot one |
| 34.11 | 3.75 | 37.86 | of the most important things that you |
| 35.61 | 5.55 | 41.16 | can remember is you have to change your |
| 37.86 | 5.37 | 43.23 | levels you have to shoot some kind of a |
| 41.16 | 3.60 | 44.76 | standing up straight position you have |
| 43.23 | 3.78 | 47.01 | to change your levels and what I mean by |
| 44.76 | 5.07 | 49.83 | that is I"m here and I"m literally going |
| 47.01 | 5.28 | 52.29 | to change my level slower so now I"m |
| 49.83 | 4.59 | 54.42 | lower than my partner"s Center gravity |
| 52.29 | 4.14 | 56.43 | to my opponent center of gravity and |
| 54.42 | 4.32 | 58.74 | that"s what I have to do before I think |
| 56.43 | 5.34 | 61.77 | my penetration step soften my time come |
| 58.74 | 5.13 | 63.87 | to my stance change my levels now look |
| 61.77 | 5.64 | 67.41 | where I am almost in that same exact |
| 63.87 | 6.51 | 70.38 | position romo my knees correct basically |
| 67.41 | 5.37 | 72.78 | exactly where we were from the game once |
| 70.38 | 4.35 | 74.73 | I changed my levels that"s where I"m at |
| 72.78 | 3.71 | 76.49 | now I gotta remember my front knees |
| 74.73 | 5.70 | 80.43 | gonna hit first |
| 76.49 | 6.43 | 82.92 | it"s slide okay in your warm-ups this is |
| 80.43 | 3.96 | 84.39 | something you can also view and I like |
| 82.92 | 3.96 | 86.88 | to go back and forth just because it |
| 84.39 | 6.69 | 91.08 | kind of gives me a place to do it but |
| 86.88 | 8.64 | 95.52 | I"m in my stance changing my levels I"m |
| 91.08 | 7.10 | 98.18 | imagining that I"m shooting through here |
| 95.52 | 6.03 | 101.55 | just a straight penetration step for now |
| 98.18 | 6.87 | 105.05 | here to change my levels front knee it"s |

| 113.58 | 8.52 | 122.10 | penetrate that"s gonna be the normal |
| 118.40 | 5.80 | 124.20 | penetration step what I like to do is go |
| 122.10 | 5.22 | 127.32 | back and forth a few times and switching |
| 124.20 | 3.78 | 127.98 | legs so just in your stance look nice |
