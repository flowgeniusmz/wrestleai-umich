| 23.84 | 4.88 | 28.72 | tutorials and i"m not even talking about |
| 25.84 | 5.28 | 31.12 | on youtube i"m talking about just in |

| 33.04 | 3.76 | 36.80 | a wrestler they want to learn the double |
| 34.88 | 5.04 | 39.92 | legs of a wrestler |
| 36.80 | 4.08 | 40.88 | but it"s taught so fast it"s taught too |
| 39.92 | 2.88 | 42.80 | fast |
| 40.88 | 4.88 | 45.76 | and you"re not learning the fundamentals |
| 42.80 | 4.88 | 47.68 | the most basic drill in order to start |
| 45.76 | 4.16 | 49.92 | learning from scratch |
| 47.68 | 4.16 | 51.84 | instead they skip you ahead you skip |
| 49.92 | 3.92 | 53.84 | kindergarten and you go right to the |
| 51.84 | 3.68 | 55.52 | third grade and |
| 53.84 | 4.32 | 58.16 | it really helps to be |
| 55.52 | 4.56 | 60.08 | in kindergarten it really does okay so |
| 58.16 | 3.36 | 61.52 | check this out um |
| 60.08 | 2.80 | 62.88 | what we"re going to do go ahead and face |
| 61.52 | 2.24 | 63.76 | each other at first |
| 62.88 | 2.88 | 65.76 | okay |
| 63.76 | 4.16 | 67.92 | so what we want to do is we want to have |
| 65.76 | 3.44 | 69.20 | one wrestler square |
| 67.92 | 3.44 | 71.36 | and he"s going to do what we call |
| 69.20 | 3.68 | 72.88 | scarecrow because we"re talking about |
| 71.36 | 2.96 | 74.32 | people who don"t know much |
| 72.88 | 3.92 | 76.80 | he wants to have a slight good bend in |
| 74.32 | 4.80 | 79.12 | the knees not not showing you super low |
| 76.80 | 3.84 | 80.64 | that"s too low okay we need something |
| 79.12 | 4.08 | 83.20 | comfortable and easy |
| 80.64 | 4.08 | 84.72 | okay we want the attack wrestler to have |
| 83.20 | 3.04 | 86.24 | a right leg lead |
| 84.72 | 3.28 | 88.00 | okay if he"s right most people are |
| 86.24 | 3.36 | 89.60 | right-handed so we"re going to get a |
| 88.00 | 3.36 | 91.36 | right leg lead |
| 89.60 | 3.92 | 93.52 | he"s going to measure his opponent go |
| 91.36 | 3.04 | 94.40 | two hands on the shoulders |
| 93.52 | 3.36 | 96.88 | okay |
| 94.40 | 5.04 | 99.44 | and then at this point he"s already got |
| 96.88 | 4.80 | 101.68 | his right leg lead which means he has a |
| 99.44 | 4.48 | 103.92 | back leg to drive off of |
| 101.68 | 3.52 | 105.20 | you should not be too wide so if his leg |
| 103.92 | 2.80 | 106.72 | was back more |
| 105.20 | 4.16 | 109.36 | this is too wide |
| 106.72 | 4.88 | 111.60 | if he"s too wide he won"t be able to |
| 109.36 | 3.84 | 113.20 | take a step he won"t be able to take a |
| 111.60 | 3.60 | 115.20 | step and we need to be able to take a |
| 113.20 | 4.24 | 117.44 | step with our front foot so our feet |
| 115.20 | 4.72 | 119.92 | should be closer together |
| 117.44 | 4.00 | 121.44 | not too close not too wide |
| 119.92 | 2.64 | 122.56 | okay perfect |
| 121.44 | 2.80 | 124.24 | what he"s going to do is he"s going to |
| 122.56 | 3.44 | 126.00 | release the shoulders this is his |
| 124.24 | 4.16 | 128.40 | measuring stick |
| 126.00 | 4.40 | 130.40 | he measures with his hands touching the |
| 128.40 | 4.16 | 132.56 | shoulders he"s gonna release pull the |
| 130.40 | 3.12 | 133.52 | elbows in and level change |
| 132.56 | 1.84 | 134.40 | okay |
| 133.52 | 4.00 | 137.52 | now |
| 134.40 | 4.40 | 138.80 | the next moment is the crucial step this |
| 137.52 | 3.12 | 140.64 | is step one |
| 138.80 | 5.60 | 144.40 | level change |
| 140.64 | 5.60 | 146.24 | step two he"s going to take a step now |
| 144.40 | 3.52 | 147.92 | he"s a little far away i would rather |
| 146.24 | 4.08 | 150.32 | have you a little closer |
| 147.92 | 5.84 | 153.76 | we want to step three in a row |
| 150.32 | 6.24 | 156.56 | at least toe to toe show me toe to toe |
| 153.76 | 3.76 | 157.52 | or three in a row three in a row |
| 156.56 | 2.80 | 159.36 | yeah |
| 157.52 | 3.76 | 161.28 | you notice he"s getting a little wide |
| 159.36 | 4.64 | 164.00 | now let"s restart again |
| 161.28 | 3.84 | 165.12 | okay hands on the shoulders notice he"s |
| 164.00 | 2.48 | 166.48 | comfortable |
| 165.12 | 3.92 | 169.04 | close enough |
| 166.48 | 4.32 | 170.80 | level change elbows come in |
| 169.04 | 3.12 | 172.16 | three in a row |
| 170.80 | 3.28 | 174.08 | now |
| 172.16 | 3.44 | 175.60 | when he penetrates |
| 174.08 | 4.48 | 178.56 | the beginner is going to put their back |
| 175.60 | 6.24 | 181.84 | leg down do not do not |
| 178.56 | 6.08 | 184.64 | knee goes over toe the front leg |
| 181.84 | 5.04 | 186.88 | as he pushes his opponent back |
| 184.64 | 4.64 | 189.28 | the head is up |
| 186.88 | 6.08 | 192.96 | the back is straight |
| 189.28 | 4.72 | 194.00 | the trail leg comes up |
| 192.96 | 2.64 | 195.60 | okay |
| 194.00 | 3.12 | 197.12 | now let"s follow around here with the |
| 195.60 | 3.92 | 199.52 | camera |
| 197.12 | 4.48 | 201.60 | okay the head is up |
| 199.52 | 4.08 | 203.60 | notice the hands now you"re going to get |
| 201.60 | 3.92 | 205.52 | some different preferences hands are |
| 203.60 | 4.24 | 207.84 | wrapped around the hamstrings |
| 205.52 | 4.00 | 209.52 | they could go behind the knees |
| 207.84 | 3.84 | 211.68 | okay |
| 209.52 | 4.32 | 213.84 | they could stay up here i mean it"s it"s |
| 211.68 | 3.92 | 215.60 | kind of it"s all optional there"s people |
| 213.84 | 3.52 | 217.36 | who like different stuff |
| 215.60 | 3.68 | 219.28 | now what we want to do is we want to |
| 217.36 | 3.36 | 220.72 | turn a little bit and do what"s called a |
| 219.28 | 4.08 | 223.36 | swisher step |
| 220.72 | 4.88 | 225.60 | which is over here |
| 223.36 | 3.52 | 226.88 | and we"re going to bring that right foot |
| 225.60 | 3.76 | 229.36 | in this direction |
| 226.88 | 4.00 | 230.88 | just pivot just pivot |
| 229.36 | 4.72 | 234.08 | as he does that |
| 230.88 | 6.00 | 236.88 | this leg also is moving to the side |
| 234.08 | 6.48 | 240.56 | this one around the corner yep |
| 236.88 | 4.96 | 241.84 | and he takes a nice deep elbow deep grip |
| 240.56 | 3.20 | 243.76 | okay |
| 241.84 | 3.92 | 245.76 | now once you get that step you have |
| 243.76 | 4.16 | 247.92 | what"s called an angle and we"re |
| 245.76 | 4.16 | 249.92 | teaching the wrestler or the |
| 247.92 | 4.32 | 252.24 | competitor the grappler |
| 249.92 | 4.88 | 254.80 | to get a good angle head is up |
| 252.24 | 4.96 | 257.20 | he"s going to push off of the |
| 254.80 | 4.96 | 259.76 | drive leg was the trail leg now it"s the |
| 257.20 | 4.72 | 261.92 | drive leg and let"s notice over here |
| 259.76 | 3.92 | 263.68 | come around here |
| 261.92 | 3.68 | 265.60 | the right leg now |
| 263.68 | 3.68 | 267.36 | is going to take a step |
| 265.60 | 3.52 | 269.12 | so he"s going to push off and take a |
| 267.36 | 4.48 | 271.84 | step |
| 269.12 | 5.52 | 274.64 | at that point this toe |
| 271.84 | 4.88 | 276.72 | should be pointing roughly perpendicular |
| 274.64 | 4.16 | 278.80 | to his opponent |
| 276.72 | 4.24 | 280.96 | the ears on the back |
| 278.80 | 4.40 | 283.20 | so let"s come around the back side |
| 280.96 | 3.68 | 284.64 | i"d like you to collect that elbow deep |
| 283.20 | 3.60 | 286.80 | nice |
| 284.64 | 3.52 | 288.16 | and now he"s brought the leg up |
| 286.80 | 3.28 | 290.08 | almost like he"s putting it on top of |
| 288.16 | 4.72 | 292.88 | the shelf |
| 290.08 | 5.12 | 295.20 | they"re in a good balanced form position |
| 292.88 | 5.44 | 298.32 | and then he"s going to shuffle his feet |
| 295.20 | 5.28 | 300.48 | and sweep out the opponent |
| 298.32 | 2.96 | 301.28 | taking him straight to his back |
| 300.48 | 2.96 | 303.44 | okay |
| 301.28 | 3.76 | 305.04 | if we can our opponent in wrestling is |
| 303.44 | 3.12 | 306.56 | gonna go to their belly |
| 305.04 | 3.60 | 308.64 | so |
| 306.56 | 5.04 | 311.60 | hands on the shoulders let"s go a little |
| 308.64 | 4.64 | 313.28 | quicker |

## Transcript Text
teach me grappling what's up guys brian peterson we are back we've got alex we've got lucas both high school wrestlers um been wrestling for a number of years and we're going to teach you guys how to do the perfect double leg now in order to learn a double leg you need to learn it in steps when you're first starting out and one of the problems with a lot of tutorials and i'm not even talking about on youtube i'm talking about just in most martial arts schools everybody wants to learn how to be like a wrestler they want to learn the double legs of a wrestler but it's taught so fast it's taught too fast and you're not learning the fundamentals the most basic drill in order to start learning from scratch instead they skip you ahead you skip kindergarten and you go right to the third grade and it really helps to be in kindergarten it really does okay so check this out um what we're going to do go ahead and face each other at first okay so what we want to do is we want to have one wrestler square and he's going to do what we call scarecrow because we're talking about people who don't know much he wants to have a slight good bend in the knees not not showing you super low that's too low okay we need something comfortable and easy okay we want the attack wrestler to have a right leg lead okay if he's right most people are right-handed so we're going to get a right leg lead he's going to measure his opponent go two hands on the shoulders okay and then at this point he's already got his right leg lead which means he has a back leg to drive off of you should not be too wide so if his leg was back more this is too wide if he's too wide he won't be able to take a step he won't be able to take a step and we need to be able to take a step with our front foot so our feet should be closer together not too close not too wide okay perfect what he's going to do is he's going to release the shoulders this is his measuring stick he measures with his hands touching the shoulders he's gonna release pull the elbows in and level change okay now the next moment is the crucial step this is step one level change step two he's going to take a step now he's a little far away i would rather have you a little closer we want to step three in a row at least toe to toe show me toe to toe or three in a row three in a row yeah you notice he's getting a little wide now let's restart again okay hands on the shoulders notice he's comfortable close enough level change elbows come in three in a row now when he penetrates the beginner is going to put their back leg down do not do not knee goes over toe the front leg as he pushes his opponent back the head is up the back is straight the trail leg comes up okay now let's follow around here with the camera okay the head is up notice the hands now you're going to get some different preferences hands are wrapped around the hamstrings they could go behind the knees okay they could stay up here i mean it's it's kind of it's all optional there's people who like different stuff now what we want to do is we want to turn a little bit and do what's called a swisher step which is over here and we're going to bring that right foot in this direction just pivot just pivot as he does that this leg also is moving to the side this one around the corner yep and he takes a nice deep elbow deep grip okay now once you get that step you have what's called an angle and we're teaching the wrestler or the competitor the grappler to get a good angle head is up he's going to push off of the drive leg was the trail leg now it's the drive leg and let's notice over here come around here the right leg now is going to take a step so he's going to push off and take a step at that point this toe should be pointing roughly perpendicular to his opponent the ears on the back so let's come around the back side i'd like you to collect that elbow deep nice and now he's brought the leg up almost like he's putting it on top of the shelf they're in a good balanced form position and then he's going to shuffle his feet and sweep out the opponent taking him straight to his back okay if we can our opponent in wrestling is gonna go to their belly so hands on the shoulders let's go a little quicker doubles in level change take a step down to the knee switch your step elbow goes deep finish go ahead let's do it again so as we take that step that last step and we drive up to our feet i'm just calling finish now which these boys have done tons of drills of shuffling the feet and taking down their opponent so keep that in mind all right ready level change take a step down to the move trailer comes up swisher and take a step and finish i'd like to see i want you to get this swisher step you're going to turn okay turn elbow deep step up one more here we go level change take a step down to the knee trailer comes up swisher and finish nice now this has got to be taught like over and over from the basics and that's what we're going to do now watch boys thank you thank you boys come on over come on line up spread out side by side boys side by side shoulder guys come on here here come on boys let's go okay focus you're

grabbing around their legs trail leg comes up swish sure we're gonna we're gonna turn our hip and grab super deep if we can with our left elbow ready we're going to go to the finished position we're kind of turning the steering wheel so we turn that steering wheel and take the step now we're not going to take it to the mat because we don't have a partner we're just going to get right back in our stance here we go let's go stagger hands on the shoulders level change take a step down to the knee trailer comes up swisher finish back in your stance one more i'm going to do it so you can see get
