(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\nOlympic gold medalist David Taylor earned a third world wrestling title by pinning rival Hassan Yazdani of Iran as the U.S. won the first three gold medals of the championships in Belgrade.\nTaylor was up 9-3 when he pinned Yazdani with 2.6 seconds left in their six-minute 86kg freestyle final.\n“I’m the most dynamic, dominant wrestler the sport’s ever seen,” said the wrestler nicknamed “The Magic Man” for an early penchant for come-from-behind wins.\nTaylor, 32, is now 3-1 against Yazdani in global finals after wins at the Tokyo Games and 2022 Worlds and a loss at the 2021 Worlds. He also defeated Yazdani en route to his first world title in 2018.\nTaylor has repeated that the rivalry with Yazdani, a four-time global champion, keeps him motivated. But he added his two daughters to that list on Sunday. London, 3, recently gave dad her first medal from Soccer Shots.\n“Daddy, I want you to look at this every day, and I want you to be a champion,” she told him.\nWith this world medal, Taylor earned a bye into the finals of April’s Olympic Trials, which will be at his training base of Penn State. Taylor’s last loss to an American in major competition was in 2017.\nLast year, Taylor said he “contemplated retiring multiple times” since his gold in Tokyo and “was hurt all year, hardly could train,” due at least in part to knee swelling.\n“I just didn’t know if I wanted to do it anymore,” he said then. “I achieved my lifelong goal of Olympic champion. I believed if I could go to world championships eight weeks later, I’d probably be done. Going there [to 2021 Worlds] and losing, it was hard.”\nNext year, Taylor can become the third U.S. wrestler to win back-to-back Olympic titles, and just the second in the last century after John Smith in 1988 and 1992. Taylor is already older than any previous U.S. Olympic wrestling gold medalist, according to Olympedia.org.\nAlso Sunday, Americans Vito Arujau and Zain Retherford won world titles at 61kg and 70kg, respectively, which are not Olympic weights.\nExpect Arujau, a 24-year-old reigning NCAA champion for Cornell, to move down to 57kg or up to 65kg for April’s Olympic Trials. At the Tokyo Olympic Trials, Arujau was runner-up at 57kg to eventual Olympic bronze medalist Thomas Gilman.\nArujau’s father, Vugar, was a 1991 World champion for the Soviet Union, a 1992 Olympic bronze medalist for the Unified Team and 1995 World champion for Russia.\nExpect Retherford, who also won 70kg silver at the 2022 Worlds, to move down to 65kg or up to 74kg for Olympic Trials. He was the top seed at 65kg for the Tokyo Olympic Trials and eliminated before the finals.\nMason Parris added bronze at 125kg, his first senior world medal.\nIt came 11 days after it was announced he replaced Olympic gold medalist Gable Steveson in the event. Steveson did not announce a reason for his withdrawal, though he has since performed for WWE.\nIf Steveson returns to the 125kg division for Olympic Trials, he will have to beat multiple opponents en route to a possible final against Parris, who gets a bye into the finals as a world medalist.\nWorlds continue Monday, featuring American Kyle Dake against Zaurbek Sidakov, a neutral athlete from Russia, in the 74kg final. Dake is the reigning world champion. Sidakov is the reigning Olympic gold medalist.\nDISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

            "raw_content": "Iran's 'Greatest' Hassan Yazdani seeks wrestling immortality\nWith an Olympic gold medal, two world titles, and over 500k Instagram followers, Hasan Yazdani is an Iranian hero. But can he gain redemption over the one man he is yet to beat?\nFreestyle wrestling is Iran’s national sport, so when Hassan Yazdani pinned down the 74kg gold medal at the Rio 2016 Olympics, he became an instant national hero.\nHe moved up to 86kg, which better suited his growing frame, taking out the world championships gold medal at his new weight division in 2017 and 2019.\nYazdani became known as The Greatest and Fearless back home, while his Instagram account swelled to over 500K followers. Quite simply, he could walk the streets of Iran like he was The King… which is incidentally another one of his nicknames there.\n“The truth is that I hope I am worthy of these nicknames,” he told Tehran Times. “Each one is valuable for me and so I hope I can live up to the nicknames and the expectations of my great fans. I always want to keep their hope, so I accept them all and just hope that I am worthy.”\nUnconventional style\nGrowing up in wrestling-obsessed Iran, it wasn’t long before Yazdani found his way to the mat.\n“I started wrestling at 12. In our country, wrestling, especially in my town, is a popular sport,” said the Jouybar-born grappler. “We also have popular traditional wrestling and as a child, I used to go watch. I became interested early in life and eventually participated and stayed with it.\"\nHe quickly became renowned in his town for his unconventional style. While most wrestlers in his category are short and stocky in stature, the reigning 86kg world champion cut a more lanky physique.\nThis extra limb length allowed him to execute more double-leg takedowns, whereby his opponent is put down on the mat.\nWinning Olympic gold\nYazdani’s natural gifts and strength of character were on full display in the Rio 2016 final, where he came back from a daunting 6-0 deficit to defeat Russia’s much-fancied Aniuar Gedue.\n“I was thinking positive and I was thinking of winning, not even one percent of the time on the mat did I think of losing,” he revealed. “My mind was clear, I wasn’t concerned about injuries. I had my coaches and God by my side, which helped me to stay focused and earn the win.”\nRivalry with USA's David Taylor\nWhile Yazdani would have hoped for a seamless transition to the bigger 86kg weight category, he was instead brought back to earth with a literal thud.\nAt the 2017 Wrestling World Cup on home turf in Iran, he came up against the USA’s David Taylor, and a new rivalry was born.\nAfter taking an early lead, Yazdani succumbed to Taylor’s superior hand fighting ability and leg attacks, which prevented the Olympic champion of six months from performing his trademark counters.\nWith Yazdani a year more experienced at his new weight, the stage set for a grand re-match at the 2017 world championships. However, Taylor failed to win his place on the USA team after losing to J’den Cox at the notoriously competitive USA wrestling trials. Yazdani went on to become world champion, but wrestling fans still yearned for a direct bout between the duo.\nThey got their wish in the qualification round of the 2018 world championships in Budapest. After getting the better of Taylor in the opening exchanges, Yazdani surrendered a 6-2 lead to Taylor, who eventually progressed with an powerful 11-6 victory, and became 2018 world champion. Such comebacks have earned Taylor his own wrestling nickname of Magic Man.\nBut a serious knee injury prevented Taylor from defending his title at Nur-Sultan in 2019, which was almost inevitably reclaimed by Yazdani.\nThe Greatest V Magic Man\nDespite the pair’s intense previous bouts, the foundation of their rivalry is respect.\nThat was evident in a tweet in 2019, where Taylor wished Yazdini a speedy recovery after the Iranian suffered a serious knee injury of his own during training.\n“I always think about respecting all my opponents and I always wish them the best in health and personal success. No matter if they are my direct opponent or not, I wish they are in a great situation so we can put on a great show for fans.”\n“It’s been about two months since my surgery. I am back training hard, but not like the competition training. Right now, during the pause, I am working on bodybuilding, weights, and slowly training. Overall, my knee is good and not bothering me.”\nWith an extra year to recover from his injury before Tokyo 2020, a third match-up between the pair at an Olympics is a truly mouth-watering prospect.\nGiven that Yazdani has already secured his place at the Games, and Cox’ decision to move up a weight category at the USA trials (making Taylor’s route to Olympic qualification a touch less competitive), the stars seem to be aligning for a third clash.\n\"My plan is to compete at the 2024 Olympics if my body allows it.\"\nDespite having already amassed an Olympic title, three world championship medals, an Asian Games gold medal, and three Wrestling World Cups, Yazdani is still only 25.\nRegardless of what happens at the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021, he has already outlined his plan to keep wrestling until the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n“I hope I can achieve the best medals during my wrestling career for as long as my body allows me,” he said. “Ideally, I want to have the most medals, both Olympic medals, and world medals. My plan is to compete at the 2024 Olympics if my body allows it.\"\nIf Yazdani was able to keep competing until the next Olympics, perhaps a new nickname is in order for Iran’s favourite wrestler: The Timeless.\nRelated content\nReza Yazdani: Iran wrestling legend faces hopes of a nation\nWhat different weight classes are at Olympic wrestling?\n'Magic Man' returns: David Taylor qualifies USA for Tokyo 2020 after nearly a year out\nWhy Iran’s pride and prowess in wrestling is unsurpassed\nIran's Rostami sets Weighlifting world record\nYou may like"

            "raw_content": "UWW\nBy Ken Marantz\nOSLO, Norway (October 3) -- There would be no last-minute comeback this time. Hassan YAZDANI (IRI), so unbeatable against everyone else, could finally walk off the mat a winner over rival David TAYLOR (USA) for the first time in four career clashes.\nYazdani controlled the match from start to finish to notch a solid 6-2 victory over Taylor in the highly anticipated 86kg final as four freestyle titles were decided on the second day of the World Championships in Oslo on Sunday.\nYazdani's victory, coming two months after a heartbreaking loss to Taylor in the final at the Tokyo Olympics, gave him a third world title to go with his 2016 Rio Olympic gold, and capped a remarkable day for Iran in the Jordal Amfi arena.\n\"I made the people of Iran happy,\" Yazdani said. \"I need to appreciate Taylor, because he worked as a motivation and inspiration for me to work better and better and become the champion.\"\nThe vocal contingent of Iranian fans were also sent into a frenzy when rising star Amir ZARE (IRI) claimed the 125kg title, having earlier seen Iran gain finalists in all four weight classes that got underway Sunday, including Yazdani's cousin Amir YAZDANI (IRI).\n\"Iran always supports their wrestlers and fans here were great,\" Yazdani said. \"And it was because of them and God I won.\"\nThe United States had mixed success in the two other finals, with Kyle DAKE (USA) prevailing at 74kg, but Daton FIX (USA) coming up short against Abasgadzhi MAGOMEDOV (RWF) at 61kg.\nIn Tokyo, Yazdani had to settle for the Olympic silver when Taylor scored a takedown with 17 seconds left for a 4-3 win in the final. On Sunday, he never gave the American the chance to get close.\nYazdani continually kept the pressure on, using an underhook to force Taylor to the edge and score a pair of stepout points in the first period. In the second period, he added a takedown, before Taylor got on the scoreboard with a takedown with 1:03 left.\nWith the clock ticking down, Taylor tried a counter lift, but Yazdani held firm and dumped him to the mat for a takedown and the final points of an well-earned victory.\n\"He's a great competitor,\" said Taylor, whose lone world title came in 2018, where he beat Yazdani in the first round. \"Not my day.\"\nAsked what he could have done differently, Taylor quipped, \"Scored my points. He's a good wrestler. We will go again.\"\nAmir ZARE (IRI) defeated Geno PETRIASHVILI (GEO) 9-2 in the 125kg final in Oslo. (Photo: UWW / Tony Rotundo)\nZare, a 2019 world U23 champion and junior silver medalist, also avenged a loss from Tokyo in beating three-time defending champion Geno PETRIASHVILI (GEO) in the 125kg final, and he did it with an emphatic 9-2 win.\nThe 20-year-old Zare lost 6-3 to Petriashivili in the semifinals in Tokyo, where the Iranian went on to take the bronze medal. Petriashivili ended up with the silver after losing in the final to Gable STEVESON (USA), who opted not to make the trip to Oslo.\n\"After winning the bronze medal at the Olympics, I began working on my weakness right after I stepped down from the podium,\" Zare said.\nOn Sunday, Petriashvili struck first with a double-leg takedown, but that would be end of his scoring as Zare maintained a solid wall of defense that led to two takedowns off counters as well as three stepouts.\n\"The final was very hard against Geno,\" Zare said. \"I had analyzed everything for this match and prepared accordingly. And thank God everything went as planned.\"\nDake, coming off a bronze-medal run at the Tokyo Olympics, picked up his third world title and first at 74kg with a 7-3 victory over Tajmuraz SALKAZANOV (SVK).\n\"The first two times I was a young buck coming up, this time I faced adversity in Tokyo,\" Dake said \"Put that behind me and it feels nice to be back on top.\"\nKyle DAKE (USA) became a three-time world champion in Oslo. (Photo: UWW / Kadir Caliskan)\nDake, who won his two previous golds at 79kg in 2018-19, stayed focused after falling behind 2-1 in the second period on a second stepout. The American went ahead with a takedown from a single-leg to a body lock midway through the period, then put the matter to rest with a takedown to a roll.\n\"There is a lot that goes into this,\" Dake said. \"You guys get to see the glory of it. It is hard. The guys that are here in the tournament and guys back home putting countless hours to get me here.\n\"I want to thank my coaches, trainers, everybody for getting me here. My wife for managing the kids. I have two little girls and we got another one on the way. Really happy to win and represent my country.\"\nThe Russian-born Salkazanov became the fourth world medalist in Slovakian history, although he will rue missing out on becoming its first gold medalist.\nAt 61kg, Magomedov capped his senior world debut with a workmanlike 4-1 victory over Fix in the final.\n\"As you can see, I am the world champion, which means my final match went successfully,\"Magomedov said. \"I've been working hard for that and I am really glad.\"\nMagomedov, this year's European champion and 2018 world junior gold medalist, received two activity clock points, then put the match away with a takedown off a counter against the ever-attacking Fix.\n\"Honestly, my plan was either to pin the opponent or finish 10-0,\" Magomedov said. \"I kind of tried to pin him, but I couldn't make it, so it is 4-1 and I am satisfied with the victory. It's the World Championships, you never have easy opponents here. I am really glad.\"\nMagomedov, who won a second straight national title in March, was accorded the honor of being named to the Russian federation team without having to go through the trials. The only other wrestler to have such treatment was 97kg superstar Abdulrashid SADULAEV (RWF).\nMagomedov, who said he plans to go up to the Olympic weight of 65kg, got the ultimate compliment from his coach after his victory.\n\"He said that I am a real man,\" Magomedov said. \"If someone calls you a real man, it's really nice. After the victory, I could see in his emotions that he was really happy. It was our first final for today, so Russia already has one gold medal.\"\nAbasgadzhi MAGOMEDOV (RWF) after winning the 61kg gold medal. (Photo: UWW / Kadir Caliskan)\nIn the bronze-medal matches, Azamat NURYKAU (BLR) was denied a place on the podium yet again when Fazil ERYILMAZ (TUR) gained a late activity clock point for a 2-1 victory at 74kg.\nNurykau, competing in his seventh World Championships, had previously made it to the bronze-medal match in 2014, 2015 and 2017 -- and lost every time. For Eryilmaz, who finished third at the Individual World Cup in 2020, it marks his first world medal on any level.\nTimur BIZHOEV (RWF), a 2018 world U23 bronze medalist, rallied from a 1-6 deficit to defeat Avtandil KENTCHADZE (GEO), 8-6, for the other 74kg bronze medal. Kentchadze's younger brother, Nika, will wrestle for a 79kg bronze on Monday.\nAt 125kg, 2016 Rio Olympic champion Taha AKGUL (TUR) earned his sixth world medal -- he now has two of each color -- when he scored all of his points in the first period in beating two-time world bronze medalist Nick GWIAZDOWSKI (USA), 6-4.\nIn the other match, 2019 world U23 bronze medalist Lkhagvagerel MUNKHTUR (MGL) scored 4 points with a takedown-lace lock combination in the first period enroute to a 5-3 victory over Asian champion Oleg BOLTIN (KAZ).\nTokyo Olympic bronze medalist Artur NAIFONOV (RWF) picked up his second world bronze at 86kg, riding a first-period takedown and second-period activity point to a 3-0 victory over Azamat DAULETBEKOV (KAZ).\nThe other 86kg bronze went to 2019 world U23 silver medalist and two-time world junior medalist Abubakr ABARAKOV (AZE), who went on a 8-point tear in the second period then held on to defeat Boris MAKOEV (SVK), 9-5.\nAt 61kg, Arsen HARUTYUNYAN (ARM) added a senior world bronze to the two he won on the junior level in 2017-18 when he manhandled Ravinder DAHIYA (IND) with a 10-0 technical fall in 2:16.\nThat Dahiya made it to the bronze-medal match was a small miracle in itself. In the repechage, he was getting hammered 0-8 by Georgi VANGELOV (BUL) when he determinedly put his opponent on his back and scored a fall at 2:36.\nToshihiro HASEGAWA (JPN), the 2018 world U23 champion at 57kg, put on a takedown clinic and gained a pair of unorthodox exposures in a 12-1 technical fall over Tuvshintulga TUMENBILEG (MGL) for the other 61kg bronze.\nOn Monday, superstar Abdulrashid SADULAEV (RWF) takes the mat as the final two freestyle weight classes of 70kg and 97kg, as well as the women's 55kg and 62kg divisions.\nHassan YAZDANI (IRI) won the gold medal at 86kg after beating David TAYLOR (USA).
