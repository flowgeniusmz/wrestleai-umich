| 0.06 | 3.99 | 4.05 | all righty well the first thing I"m |
| 1.32 | 3.90 | 5.22 | gonna go over is from the open so |
| 4.05 | 2.88 | 6.93 | there"s a couple things that I need to |
| 5.22 | 4.38 | 9.60 | pay attention to in the open the main |
| 6.93 | 5.55 | 12.48 | thing being my opponents lead leg okay |
| 9.60 | 4.95 | 14.55 | so my partner here has a left leg lead |
| 12.48 | 4.35 | 16.83 | that means that I need to match his lead |
| 14.55 | 4.53 | 19.08 | leg with my arm okay so we call that and |
| 16.83 | 3.87 | 20.70 | stop sign right come on Rob right here |
| 19.08 | 3.21 | 22.29 | and that"s the stop sign the reason that |
| 20.70 | 4.11 | 24.81 | I do that is if my partner is gonna |
| 22.29 | 4.08 | 26.37 | shoot if he"s a left leg lead he"s gonna |
| 24.81 | 2.55 | 27.36 | be shooting with his left hand okay so |
| 26.37 | 1.56 | 27.93 | this is the arm that I need to pay |
| 27.36 | 2.94 | 30.30 | attention to |
| 27.93 | 4.29 | 32.22 | now he"s gonna choose sweep single leg I |
| 30.30 | 4.47 | 34.77 | got a biblical on right here if he"s |
| 32.22 | 4.41 | 36.63 | gonna shoot a high crotch his arm right |
| 34.77 | 3.57 | 38.34 | there okay so that"s the first thing |
| 36.63 | 4.47 | 41.10 | that I"m paying attention to when out in |
| 38.34 | 6.39 | 44.73 | the open now when I want to build up |
| 41.10 | 7.92 | 49.02 | into my tie I like to post on the head |
| 44.73 | 6.90 | 51.63 | to start okay and then I"m gonna close |
| 49.02 | 4.56 | 53.58 | the gap okay so I post the head and |
| 51.63 | 3.15 | 54.78 | close the gap and I"m getting to my call |
| 53.58 | 3.93 | 57.51 | all right now the reason that I do that |
| 54.78 | 5.43 | 60.21 | is if I just reach to the collar right |
| 57.51 | 4.50 | 62.01 | away he"s dropping down and getting it |
| 60.21 | 4.59 | 64.80 | on my legs so I like to build up into it |
| 62.01 | 5.40 | 67.41 | all right now I"m actually like post |
| 64.80 | 5.25 | 70.05 | close the gap goes my collar all right |
| 67.41 | 4.56 | 71.97 | now from here I need to be controlling |
| 70.05 | 3.39 | 73.44 | both sides of his body all right so that |
| 71.97 | 4.41 | 76.38 | means that I need to be inside on both |
| 73.44 | 5.13 | 78.57 | sides so I can see the collar and then I |
| 76.38 | 3.87 | 80.25 | get a tricep go down right here so I"m |
| 78.57 | 3.87 | 82.44 | controlling both sides of this body all |
| 80.25 | 5.37 | 85.62 | right this is where I want to be again |
